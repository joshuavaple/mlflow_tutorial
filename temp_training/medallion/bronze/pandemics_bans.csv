Shipments of the world's first WHO-recommended malaria vaccine, RTS,S, have begun with 331 200 doses landing last night in YaoundÃ©, Cameroon. The delivery is the first to a country not previously involved in the malaria vaccine pilot programme and signals that scale-up of vaccination against malaria across the highest-risk areas on the African continent will begin shortly.

Nearly every minute, a child under five dies of malaria. In 2021, there were 247 million malaria cases globally, which led to 619 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77 per cent were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounts for approximately 95% of global malaria cases and 96% of related deaths in 2021.

A further 1.7 million doses of the RTS,S vaccine are expected to arrive in Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone in the coming weeks, with additional African countries set to receive doses in the months ahead. This reflects the fact that several countries are now in the final stage of preparations for malaria vaccine introduction into routine immunisation programmes, which should see first doses administered in Q1 2024.

Comprehensive preparations are needed to introduce any new vaccine into essential immunisation programmes - such as training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand, and sequencing and integrating rollout alongside the delivery of other vaccines and health interventions. Delivering the malaria vaccine has the added challenge of a four-dose schedule which requires careful planning to effectively deliver.

Since 2019, Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi have been administering the vaccine in a schedule of 4 doses from around 5 months of age in selected districts as part of the pilot programme, known as the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). More than 2 million children have been reached with the malaria vaccine in the three African countries through MVIP - resulting in a remarkable 13% drop in all-cause mortality in children age-eligible to receive the vaccine, and substantial reductions in severe malaria illness and hospitalizations. Other key findings from the pilot programme show that vaccine uptake is high, with no reduction in use of other malaria prevention measures or uptake of other vaccines. MVIP is coordinated by WHO in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, and funded by Gavi, the Global Fund, and UNITAID, with donated doses from GSK, the manufacturer of the RTS,S vaccine.

The data from the pilot have shown the impact and safety of the RTS,S vaccine and provided important evidence on vaccine acceptability and uptake that helped inform the recent WHO recommendation of a second malaria vaccine - R21, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Results of a phase 3 trial for R21 showed that the vaccine has a good safety profile in the clinical trial setting and reduces malaria in children. It is expected that, like RTS,S, when R21 is implemented it will have similar high public health impact. The choice of which vaccine to be used in a country should be based on programmatic characteristics, vaccine supply, and affordability.

The R21 vaccine is currently under review by WHO for prequalification. The availability of two malaria vaccines is expected to increase supply to meet the high demand from African countries and result in sufficient vaccine doses to benefit all children living in areas where malaria is a public health risk. In preparation for scaled-up vaccination, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF and partners are working with countries that have expressed interest and/or have confirmed rollout plans on the next steps.

These developments mean that broad implementation of malaria vaccination in endemic regions has the potential to be a gamechanger for malaria control efforts, and could save tens of thousands of lives each year. However, malaria vaccines are not a standalone solution. They should be introduced in the context of the WHO-recommended package of malaria control measures which include insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women, antimalarials, effective case management, and treatment, all of which have helped to reduce malaria-related deaths since 2000. Importantly, the MVIP showed that delivering vaccines alongside non-vaccine interventions can reinforce the uptake of other vaccines and the use of insecticide treated nets, and overall boost access to malaria prevention measures.

""The world needs good news - and this a good news story,"" said David Marlow, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. ""Gavi is proud that our Alliance of stakeholders, with African countries at the forefront, took the decision to invest in the malaria vaccine as a public health priority, and that this support has played a part in the availability of a new tool that can save the lives of thousands of children each year. We are excited to rollout this historic vaccine through Gavi programmes and work with partners to ensure it is delivered alongside other vital measures.""

""This could be a real gamechanger in our fight against malaria,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""Introducing vaccines is like adding a star player to the pitch. With this long-anticipated step, spearheaded by African leaders, we are entering a new era in immunization and malaria control, hopefully saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children every year.""

""This is another breakthrough moment for malaria vaccines and malaria control, and a ray of light in a dark time for so many vulnerable children in the world. The delivery of malaria vaccines to new countries across Africa will offer life-saving protection to millions of children at risk of malaria,"" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""But we must not stop here. Together, we must find the will and the resources to bring malaria vaccines to scale, so more children can live longer, healthier lives.""

""This is a significant advancement towards scaling up malaria vaccination in the region. The vaccine, which protects children from the severe forms of the disease, is a vital addition to the existing set of malaria prevention tools and will help bolster our efforts to reverse the rising trend in cases and further reduce deaths,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia

As of 2020, the SEA Region accounted for a substantial portion of the global cervical cancer burden, with 200,000 new cases (32% of the global burden) and 100,000 deaths (34% of global fatalities), according to Global Cancer Observatory 2020. The global strategy for elimination was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2020. Since the launch of the global strategy, Member States have demonstrated commendable political will, exemplified by the formulation and launch of elimination strategies at national level. The Interim targets within the three key pillars of the strategy are promising, viz:

Member States have made remarkable progress in preventing, screening, and managing cervical cancer. Under the Flagship Priority of ""Prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases through multisectoral policies and plans, with a focus on best buys,"" cervical cancer prevention is one of the 'best buys.'

Over the past three years, the South-East Asia Region has achieved several milestones in the elimination roadmap, marked by the development and implementation of strategic frameworks as

The SEA Region is among the pioneers in creating an implementation framework aligned with the global strategy for eliminating cervical cancer.

As of today, six Member States of the Region have introduced the HPV vaccine nationwide (Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand), two Member States (India in Sikkim State and Bangladesh in Dhaka Division) have introduced it at sub-national level, two have planned introduction of the vaccine in 2023-24 (Nepal and Timor-Leste) while one (India) has plans to increase the scope of HPV vaccination by expanding its use to additional states. The coverage of HPV vaccination among the target girls in Bhutan has been high since 2017. Some of the other countries in the Region that faced challenges of HPV vaccine rollout during the COVID-19 pandemic are organizing catch-up vaccinations. Further, the WHO recommendation on one-dose schedule of HPV vaccination as an alternative to the two-dose schedule has been adopted by some Member States in the region.

On screening, ten out of 11 Member States reported national population-based screening programs, with nine providing early detection services at the primary health care level. Progress has been made in adopting HPV DNA screening, with Bhutan and Thailand leading in its utilization. However, achieving the 70% target by 2030 requires sustained efforts. However, a positive development is that screening has been included in essential service packages or UHC packages in several Member States.

Several Member States have established centers for managing cervical precancerous lesions, including colposcopy and thermal ablation methods. WHO support has played a pivotal role in capacity building and establishing treatment facilities. In 2022-23, WHO supported Timor-Leste in setting up the first-ever facility for treating precancerous lesions (Colposcopy and Thermal ablation) in the national hospital and expanding to three more colposcopy centers with thermal ablations. Bhutan and Myanmar were also supported in the expansion of these facilities.

Ten Member States in the region have tertiary-level cancer care. Pathology services for cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy and cancer surgeries are also available in ten countries. Nine countries have services for radiation therapy. With the aim of accelerating the scaling up of treatment services for invasive cancers, SEARO has established the South-East Asia Cancer Grid (SEACanGrid), which facilitates leveraging the strengths of one institution in building capacity of another across countries. Primary health care and community-based palliative care is expanding in the region, with exemplary initiatives in Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka. Population-based cancer registries are operational and being strengthened in eight Member States.

Ensuring all women have access to affordable and effective cervical cancer prevention and management services remains a priority. While ten out of 11 Member States report having pathology services for cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment facilities at tertiary levels, including surgical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy services, are not universally accessible, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this, a robust health system through Universal Health Coverage is imperative, ensuring services are available without causing catastrophic expenditure to beneficiaries.

Despite setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to resume and strengthen HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening programs are underway.

It is crucial to emphasize that cervical cancer is a preventable and curable disease if detected early and treated adequately. The commitment and support of Member States extended during the Regional Committee meetings of WHO-SEARO to the global cervical cancer elimination initiative is unwavering, as demonstrated by dedicated discussions and agenda items during Regional Committee meetings held in 2019 and 2022.

Let us continue our collaborative efforts, navigate challenges, and propel the region towards the shared goal of eliminating cervical cancer.",https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/17-11-2023-cervical-cancer-elimination-day-of-action-2023-ms,-1,,eng-9062161,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Cervical cancer prevention soars to new heights

The fight against cervical cancer is scaling rapidly, thanks in large part to the growing momentum of HPV vaccination programs. In October, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Cambodia joined the ranks of countries that include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the national schedule, following Indonesia's successful national rollout. These nations, home to substantial populations, shoulder a significant portion of the global cervical cancer burden.

Adding to the excitement is the upcoming introduction of HPV vaccination in India, and Pakistan's announcement of their intent to join the ranks of countries protecting women from cervical cancer. In a further boost to this cause, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), has recommended adding HPV vaccine to the national vaccination schedule. Collectively, these seven countries account for a third of the global cervical cancer burden, which will be significantly reduced in the future through HPV vaccination in the here and now.

Malaria control: a ray of hope

The battle against malaria is also witnessing a remarkable advance, thanks to the addition of malaria vaccine to the existing toolbox of malaria control interventions. With the completion of the pilot implementation of the RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi we are learning about the dimensions of vaccine impact. Recently presented data show a 13% reduction in all-cause mortality (excluding trauma) among children eligible for vaccination. Notably this impact was achieved at approximately 64-74% coverage, previewing the likelihood of even greater impact as the coverage scales up. Adding malaria vaccine to the portfolio of malaria interventions is about optimizing the mix of interventions, each of which are imperfect. Not only does this ease the health burden and suffering of children and their families, but also translates into substantial cost savings for healthcare systems.

The good news doesn't stop there. Nine additional countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, are set to introduce the vaccine into their routine immunization programs beginning in early 2024. With a WHO policy recommendation for the second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, now in place, additional countries are also planning for introduction, given the expectation for sufficient supply, once the R21/Matrix-M vaccine achieves WHO prequalification. Having vaccines against malaria is a testament to the power of innovation and global collaboration in the fight against malaria.

Measles outbreaks and the importance of fully vaccinated children

The immunization community is anticipating the joint report by WHO and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on the 2022 measles case and mortality estimates, scheduled for release later today 16 November. Measles, one of the most highly infectious diseases, is making an unwanted comeback, with cases and deaths increasing globally. While Africa and South Asia have faced challenges with measles in the wake of the pandemic, other regions are also contending with outbreaks: from richer countries such as Austria and the UK, to middle-income ones like Russia, South Africa and TÃ¼rkiye.

Measles is not the sole concern resulting from declining vaccination rates. As vaccine coverage decreases, measles tends to resurface first due to its high contagiousness. However, declining vaccination rates set the stage for other serious vaccine-preventable diseases to reemerge. Measles outbreaks serve as a warning sign for potential outbreaks of severe illnesses such as whooping cough, diphtheria, or polio.

In conclusion, under the banner of ""The Big Catch-Up"", it is crucial to support countries in reestablishing routine vaccination programs, improving their coverage and reaching the most left out, wherever they are found, in order to prevent large-scale global outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.",https://www.who.int/news/item/16-11-2023-message-by-the-director-of-the-department-of-immunization--vaccines-and-biologicals-at-who---october-2023,-1,,eng-9062694,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Notably, COPD was the third leading cause of death in China and accounted for more than 0.9 million deaths in 2013. A nationwide intervention with integrated strategies and measures targeting COPD care in primary health care has been implemented with key initiatives, including screening for people at high risk of COPD and a national programme for improving use of lung function tests. Through efforts by the Chinese Government, the capacity of screening and management of COPD in primary health care has been greatly improved.

This work is part of China's Medium-to-long term plan of China for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases (2017-2025), which aligns with the objectives of the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases.

Improve the accessibility of early diagnosis and treatment of COPD

China has made strategic investments to improve the accessibility of COPD care service in primary health care institutes. This initiative encompasses an in-depth understanding of the COPD country profile, identification the gap in the accessibility and affordability of essential technique and medicines and the formulation of effective solutions to overcome challenges. The China Pulmonary Health Study, conducted from 2012 to 2015, revealed that 8.6% of the general Chinese adult population (or 99.9 million Chinese adults) aged 20 years or older in 2015 had spirometry-defined COPD, with only 10% ever having received a pulmonary function test. Recognizing this gap, the central Government of China launched a national project which allocated funds to equip primary health care institutes with portable spirometers and provided professional training to provide primary care workers.

""China recognizes the urgency of tackling COPD, a disease affecting millions of our citizens. Through strategic investments and targeted interventions, we have significantly improved the accessibility and quality of COPD care in our primary health care settings."" Said Professor Chen Wang, the Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) in China, ""by integrating WHO guidelines and collaborating closely, we aim to further enhance our COPD care capabilities and contribute to global efforts in combating noncommunicable diseases.""

The project's goal was to improve their capabilities in the early detection and proficient management of COPD. As a result of the work, 30 000 portable spirometry equipment units have been distributed, covering nearly half of the primary care settings nationwide. Between 2020-2023, over 140 000 primary health care workers have received comprehensive training on pulmonary function tests, fortifying their skills in the early diagnosis of COPD. In October 2021 China initiated national COPD screening, and the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) China-Japan Friendship Hospital played a leadership role in steering this endeavour.

Through a combination of questionnaires and portable spirometers, health care workers successfully screened nearly 1.5 million individuals within 2 years. This effort led to a substantial increase in the diagnosis of COPD patients. Those who have positive scores in COPD-SQ questionnaires but in normal FEV1/FVC ratio were identified as high-risk of COPD. They received early intervention education, including smoking cessation, and underwent repeat spirometry 1 year later.

Improving access to the essential medicines for COPD patients is another crucial aspect of COPD care in primary health care services. In line with WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicine (WHO EML), the National Health Commission developed the National Essential Medicines List. Six essential inhaled bronchodilators were included in the catalogue of essential medicines covered by the national medical insurance system. This strategic inclusion ensures an ample range of treatment options within primary care settings.

Enhancing COPD management through extensive network

""The collaboration between China and the WHO in advancing COPD care represents a transformative model for global health. China's commitment to improving accessibility, early diagnosis, and treatment aligns with the WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases."" Said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of WHO's Department for Noncommunicable Diseases, ""this partnership demonstrates the collective commitment to achieving the goals set forth in the WHO NCD Action Plan, paving the way for a healthier future"".

To address the poor quality of COPD care service, the WHO CC initiated the Enjoying Breathing Programme in 2017. It aims to establish a new comprehensive COPD patients' management model engaging all tiers of hospitals and disease prevention and control institutions. The programme spans the entire life course of COPD, including prevention, early detection, treatment, as well as regular follow up based on the triage of COPD patients. Most notably, the programme established a well-structured training framework including training the trainers, medical professionals in hospitals and primary care institutes, COPD patients training and self-management.

To strengthen the quality of primary care services for COPD patients, health care providers undertook specialized training. The training focused on identifying the early conditions, chandelling with exacerbation situation and lifestyle prescription to enhance the medicine compliance. Simultaneously, the COPD patients' education program was implemented to bridge the awareness gap, rectify poor self-management practices in preventing exacerbation and empower patients to make wise decisions during emergencies. During 2017-2023 the Enjoying Breathing Programme has proven impactful, benefiting over 60 000 COPD patients. Experts from the National Centre for Respiratory Medicine have offered online and on-site education to nearly 100 000 primary health care workers. This comprehensive COPD management network has been successfully implemented in 51 cities across China.

The collaboration between China and WHO in advancing COPD care not only contributes to the well-being of 1.4 billion Chinese people but also serves as a model for global health initiatives. The achievements in reducing COPD-related morbidity and mortality in China have the potential to align with the goals of the WHO NCD Action Plan.",https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/advancing-copd-care-in-china-through-a-comprehensive-approach,-1,,eng-9057016,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE
2023-11-15T08:01:14.67Z,2023-11-158223785,general_medical_trend,7e974a24-3df6-40a6-b8aa-a1d5bd15a5e5,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In LMIC tobacco smoking accounts for 30-40% of COPD cases, and household air pollution is a major risk factor.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. It is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis.

In people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm. Symptoms include cough, sometimes with phlegm, difficulty breathing, wheezing and tiredness.

Smoking and air pollution are the most common causes of COPD. People with COPD are at higher risk of other health problems.

COPD is not curable but symptoms can improve if one avoids smoking and exposure to air pollution and gets vaccines to prevent infections. It can also be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.

Symptoms

The most common symptoms of COPD are difficulty breathing, chronic cough (sometimes with phlegm) and feeling tired.

COPD symptoms can get worse quickly. These are called flare-ups. These usually last for a few days and often require additional medicine.

People with COPD also have a higher risk for other health problems. These include:

Common symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards. As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness. There may be a considerable financial burden due to limitation of workplace and home productivity, and costs of medical treatment.

COPD is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema usually refers to destruction of the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways in the lungs. Chronic bronchitis refers to a chronic cough with the production of phlegm resulting from inflammation in the airways. COPD and asthma share common symptoms (cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing) and people may have both conditions.

Causes

Several processes can cause the airways to become narrow and lead to COPD. There may be destruction of parts of the lung, mucus blocking the airways, and inflammation and swelling of the airway lining.

COPD develops gradually over time, often resulting from a combination of risk factors:

COPD should be suspected if a person has typical symptoms, and the diagnosis confirmed by a breathing test called spirometry, which measures how the lungs are working. In low- and middle-income countries, spirometry is often not available and so the diagnosis may be missed.

Treatment

COPD isn't curable, but it can get better by not smoking, avoiding air pollution and getting vaccines. It can be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.

There are several treatments available for COPD.

Inhaled medicines that open and reduce swelling in the airways are the main treatments.

Bronchodilator inhalers are the most important medicines for treating COPD. They relax the airways to keep them open.

Short-acting bronchodilators start to work in seconds and can last for 4-6 hours. These are often used during flare-ups.

Long-acting bronchodilators take longer to start working but last longer. These are taken daily and can be combined with inhaled steroids.

Other treatments may also be used:

Some inhalers open the airways and may be given regularly to prevent or reduce symptoms, and to relieve symptoms during acute flare-ups. Inhaled corticosteroids are sometimes given in combination with these to reduce inflammation in the lungs.

Inhalers must be taken using the correct technique, and in some cases with a spacer device to help deliver the medication into the airways more effectively. Access to inhalers is limited in many low- and middle-income countries; in 2021 salbutamol inhalers were generally available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries.

Flare-ups are often caused by a respiratory infection, and people may be given an antibiotic or steroid tablets in addition to inhaled or nebulised treatment as needed.

Living with COPD

Lifestyle changes can help improve symptoms of COPD.

Quit smoking or vaping. This is the most important thing to do. Even if you have been smoking for many years, quitting can still help.

Avoid second-hand smoke or smoke from indoor cooking fires.

People living with COPD must be given information about their condition, treatment and self-care to help them to stay as active and healthy as possible.

WHO response

COPD is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

WHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for COPD in a number of ways.

The WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) was developed to help improve NCD management in primary health care in low-resource settings. PEN includes protocols for the assessment, diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and modules on healthy lifestyle counselling, including tobacco cessation and self-care.

Rehabilitation 2030 is a new strategic approach to prioritize and strengthen rehabilitation services in health systems. Pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD is included in the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation, currently under development as part of this WHO initiative.

Reducing tobacco smoke exposure is important for both primary prevention of COPD and disease management. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is enabling progress in this area as are WHO initiatives such as MPOWER and mTobacco Cessation.

There is an estimated 392 million people living with COPD and three quarters of them live in low- and middle-income countries.

Tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In low-and-middle-income-countries tobacco smoking accounts for 30-40% of COPD cases with household air pollution being the other major risk factor.

""As well as being a major cause of long-term disability, COPD is the third commonest cause of death worldwide. COPD due to smoking remains a major problem globally and there is a growing epidemic of smokers in low- and middle-income countries as tobacco companies actively seek new customers. Around 80% of the world's 1.3 billion tobacco users now live in LMIC. This will undoubtedly lead to an enormous increase in the global burden of COPD in the coming decades. We must act now to reduce smoking rates, to ensure people with COPD are diagnosed as early as possible and to ensure all patients around the world receive effective therapy."" said Prof. David MG Halpin, Consultant Physician & Professor of Respiratory Medicine, Member of GOLD Board of Directors and the Forum of International Respiratory Societies.

People living with COPD face a greater risk of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the challenges in accessing healthcare for these individuals. Quitting smoking will not only reduce your risk of COPD but also significantly reduces the risk of these severe coexisting conditions.

Findings show that tobacco smoke dramatically impacts children's lung development, substantially increasing the risk of COPD later in life. The tobacco industry uses aggressive marketing strategies to promote nicotine and tobacco products which target children and adolescents.

""The scale of morbidity and mortality relating to COPD is a huge concern. We must prioritize smoking cessation, as well as inhalers and pulmonary rehabilitation. Sadly, inequities in access to diagnosis and treatment persist. We need to accelerate efforts to integrate COPD care into primary care in low- and middle-income countries where three quarters of people with COPD live."" explains Dr Bente Mikkelsen, WHO Director of Noncommunicable Diseases.",https://www.who.int/news/item/15-11-2023-smoking-is-the-leading-cause-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease,-1,,eng-9057016,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

IDF estimates that 537 million people have diabetes, a number that continues to rise making diabetes the ninth cause of death globally. Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, accounting for over 95% of all diabetes cases. However, type 2 diabetes is often preventable.

Quitting smoking not only reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but also substantially improves the management and reduces the risk of diabetes complications. Evidence suggests that smoking influences the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, which can cause type 2 diabetes.

Smoking also increases the risk of diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and blindness. Smoking also delays wound healing and increases the risk of lower limb amputations, posing a significant burden on health systems.

""The International Diabetes Federation strongly encourages people to stop smoking to reduce their risk of diabetes and, if they have diabetes, help avoid complications. We call on governments to introduce policy measures that will discourage people from smoking and remove tobacco smoke from all public spaces,"" explains Prof. Akhtar Hussain, President of the International Diabetes Federation

Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.

Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5 years. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but deaths are highest in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and it can be treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care.

Pneumonia is caused by several infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are the following.

Pneumonia can be spread in several ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this is of critical importance for treatment and prevention.

The presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more numerous than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under 5 years of age who have cough and/or difficult breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing where their chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections.

Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience unconsciousness, hypothermia and convulsions.

While most healthy children can fight the infection with their natural defences, children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. A child's immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or undernourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed.

Pre-existing illnesses, such as symptomatic HIV infections and measles, also increase a child's risk of contracting pneumonia.

The following environmental factors also increase a child's susceptibility to pneumonia:

Pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic of choice for first line treatment is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia.

Preventing pneumonia in children is an essential component of a strategy to reduce child mortality. Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia.

Adequate nutrition is key to improving children's natural defences, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In addition to being effective in preventing pneumonia, it also helps to reduce the length of the illness if a child does become ill.

Addressing environmental factors such as indoor air pollution (by providing affordable clean indoor stoves, for example) and encouraging good hygiene in crowded homes also reduces the number of children who fall ill with pneumonia.

In children infected with HIV, the antibiotic cotrimoxazole is given daily to decrease the risk of contracting pneumonia.

The WHO and UNICEF integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) aims to accelerate pneumonia control with a combination of interventions to protect, prevent and treat pneumonia in children with actions to:

Several countries including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia have developed district, state and national plans to intensify actions for the control of pneumonia and diarrhoea. Many more have integrated diarrhoea and pneumonia specific action into their national child health and child survival strategies.

Effective diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia is critical to improve child survival. To meet the Sustainable Development Goal targets for SDG 3.2.1 (reducing child mortality), ending preventable diarrhoea- and pneumonia-related deaths is an urgent priority.",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia,-1,,eng-9050381,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can neither be seen nor felt. While some people are exposed to artificial UVR sources (e.g. in medicine, industry and for disinfection and cosmetic purposes), everyone is exposed to solar UVR. Solar UVR levels are influenced by several factors:

Small amounts of UVR are beneficial to health and play an essential role in the production of vitamin D. However, excessive exposure to UVR is associated with negative health consequences as UVR is carcinogenic to humans.

Acute effects of UVR include DNA damage, sunburn, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, and suppression of the immune system. Immunosuppression can be considered as a risk factor for cancer and can cause reactivation of viruses (e.g. cold sores in the lip).

Chronic effects on skin and lips from UVR exposure include:

Excessive exposure to UVR caused around 1.2 million new cases of non-melanoma skin cancers (SCC and BCC) and 325 000 melanomas of the skin, and 64 000 premature deaths from non-melanoma and 57 000 melanomas of the skin in the year 2020.

Acute effects of UVR include photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva, respectively). These effects are reversible, easily prevented by protective eyewear and are not usually associated with any long-term damage but are painful and might require therapeutic intervention.

Chronic effects of UVR include:

UV exposure may also be involved in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Worldwide, it is estimated that 15 million people are blind due to cataracts; of these, some 10% may be due to exposure to UVR.

UVR in small amounts is essential to good health as it leads to the production of vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D strengthens the bone and musculoskeletal system. People who have very low sun exposure - such as those in institutional care or housebound, people with deeply pigmented skin living in high latitudes or those who, for religious or cultural reasons cover their entire body surface when they are outdoors - should consider oral vitamin D supplementation.

Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of UVR due to their skin and eye structure. Sunburns in childhood lead to a higher risk of skin cancer in later life. Also, a larger amount of UVR can reach and damage their retina.

Fair-skinned people suffer more from sunburn and have a higher risk of skin cancer than dark-skinned people; however, darker-skinned people also develop skin cancers. Consideration of eye damage is important for everyone.

People at increased risk include those with a high number of naevi, those taking photosensitizing medication, and those with a family history of skin cancer.

Outdoor workers exposed occupationally to solar UVR levels face an increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers.

Skin cancer is highly preventable. WHO recommends the following measures to protect against excessive exposure to UVR.

Encouraging children to take the simple precautions above will prevent both short-term and long-term damage while still allowing them to enjoy the time they spend outdoors.

WHO aims to reduce the burden of disease resulting from exposure to UVR. It encourages research, develops guidance and disseminates information tools about effective UVR protection interventions related to the public, occupationally exposed workers and patients.

The Global Solar UV index (UVI), an information tool that describes the level of solar UVR at the Earth's surface, was developed by WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

The UVI is an indicator of the potential for skin damage. It alerts people about the need to adopt protective measures when exposed to UVR. The higher the UVI value, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Sun protection measures should be used when the UVI reaches 3 or above.",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ultraviolet-radiation,-1,,eng-9045075,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

What are the future scenarios and what can each of us do to cope with the impact of climate change?

We are talking to today. Welcome, Diarmid. Diarmid, talk to us about the impact of climate change on our health.

So some of the effects are really direct. So sometimes it's just too hot to be healthy. So we know that climate change is increasing temperatures, particularly in cities. And anybody with a pre-existing condition or if you are older or if you have, for example, heart disease, unfortunately, you're more likely to get sick when temperatures are very high or even to die in extreme high temperatures. So that's a very direct effect.

We also see the effects of climate change on the environment. So those increased temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns in some parts of the world are drying out the environment, drying out forests, making it easier to have more and stronger severe wildfires. Now wildfires kill people directly.

They also lead to massive levels of air pollution. And we know that air pollution is one of the biggest killers we have. Kills about 7 million people a year around the world, about a death every five seconds. So there are those more direct effects.

But we also see climate change is making it easier to transmit infectious diseases carried by mosquitoes like malaria or dengue, or diseases carried in water, diarrheal disease, cholera and so on.

But the ultimate impact of climate change is in actually making some parts of the world uninhabitable. So either it becomes too dry to maintain agriculture or through increased sea level rise. we are actually starting to submerge islands, including some whole countries. And you can't really maintain good health when you're forcing people away from where they live.

So Diarmid, talk to us about scenarios that we are staring at. How will our health systems, our hospitals, primary health care centers, the entire health infrastructure -- how will we cope with these impacts of climate change on our health?

Well, the scenarios are not good news because and we already know we've already seen a glimpse of this. So those increased temperatures I was talking about. The record temperatures that we're now seeing around the world in a couple of decade's time, those will be the norm. And so we've experienced record temperatures in Europe. We've seen heatwaves across Asia, and we've seen directly people turning up overwhelming hospitals and in some cases in some of the historic events, even morgues overflowing with bodies. So unfortunately, that's part of the scenarios that we see for the future.

We also see more of the world being suitable for malaria transmission or for dengue transmission. So we have to be able to respond to this. And we're unfortunately committed to a certain amount of climate change because of the greenhouse gases that have already been emitted.

So we need to develop the plans and put into place the investments in our hospitals, in the training of our health workforce, in order to allow them to protect people from the impacts of climate change that we're already seeing. And part of preparing our health systems for the impacts of climate change is also making sure that they're resilient to the impacts of climate change.

And in fact, in many cases, we can do two good things for the price of one by, for example, providing renewable energy through solar panels, for health care facilities, which is more resilient to climate risks. It's cheaper and it also reduces the environmental impact.

So these are very overwhelming scenarios that you've just painted. What can we do as individuals to cope and to protect ourselves in these future scenarios?

Well, the good news is there's a great deal that we can do. And part of it is just being aware of the health risks of climate change. So in the places that we live in northern Europe, those populations have not previously been used to the kinds of temperatures that we've previously experienced. Now, if we know that it's a potential risk to your health, if it's an extremely hot day, then it's possible to protect yourself by hydrating, by staying out of the sun, by paying attention to weather warnings. So we all, as individuals, have to become a bit climate smarter in order to protect our health. So that's number one.

The second thing that we can do is that many of the things that are important to reduce climate change are really good for our health. And we actually say that the Paris Agreement to limit climate change is potentially the most important health agreement of the century, because if we are able to make a shift to a clean energy system or even as individuals, if we're able to, for example, walk or cycle to work or school or to improve our diet so that they're more sustainable and healthy, that's really good for the planet. But much more importantly, and closer to home, it's really good for your health. It's not all on you as an individual.

So one of the things we can do as individuals is to support policies and to support leaders who are able to make wise investment decisions that improve people's health, but also protects the planet.

Overview

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that most often affects the lungs and is caused by a type of bacteria. It spreads through the air when infected people cough, sneeze or spit.

Tuberculosis is preventable and curable.

About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. About 5-10% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease.

Those who are infected but not (yet) ill with the disease cannot transmit it. TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment.

In certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents TB outside of the lungs but not in the lungs.

Symptoms

People with latent TB infection don't feel sick and aren't contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk.

Certain conditions can increase a person's risk for tuberculosis disease:

Unlike TB infection, when a person gets TB disease, they will have symptoms. These may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it.

The symptoms people get depend on where in the body TB becomes active. While TB usually affects the lungs, it also affects the kidneys, brain, spine and skin.

Prevention

Follow these steps to help prevent tuberculosis infection and spread:

Special measures like respirators and ventilation are important to reduce infection in healthcare and other institutions.

Diagnosis

WHO recommends the use of rapid molecular diagnostic tests as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB.

Rapid diagnostic tests recommended by WHO include the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Truenat assays. These tests have high diagnostic accuracy and will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB.

A tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferongamma release assay (IGRA) can be used to identity people with infection.

Diagnosing multidrug-resistant and other resistant forms of TB (see multidrug-resistant TB section below) as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive.

Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children.

Treatment

Tuberculosis disease is treated with antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease.

To be effective, these medications need to be taken daily for 4-6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice. This can allow TB that is still alive to become resistant to the drugs.

Tuberculosis that doesn't respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires more toxic treatment with different medicines.

Multidrug-resistant TB

Drug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs. However, second-line treatment options require extensive medicines that are expensive and toxic.

In some cases, more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options.

MDR-TB remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2022.

In accordance with WHO guidelines, detection of MDR/RR-TB requires bacteriological confirmation of TB and testing for drug resistance using rapid molecular tests or culture methods.

In 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritize a 6-month regimen - the BPaLM/BPaL - as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. In the past, MDR-TB treatment used to last for at least 9 months and up to 20 months. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens.

TB and HIV

People living with HIV are 16 (uncertainty interval 14-18) times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV.

HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each speeding the other's progress. Without proper treatment, 60% of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die. In 2022, about 167 000 people died of HIV-associated TB. The percentage of notified TB patients who had a documented HIV test result in 2022 was 80%, up from 76% in 2021. The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB. Overall in 2022, only 54% of TB patients known to be living with HIV were on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

WHO recommends a 12-component approach of collaborative TB-HIV activities, including actions for prevention and treatment of infection and disease, to reduce deaths.

Impact

Tuberculosis mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries.

TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2022, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in WHO's South-East Asian Region (46%), followed by the African Region (23%) and the Western Pacific (18%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with more than two-thirds of the global total in Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines. Globally, about 50% of TB patients and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income), far from the WHO End TB Strategy target of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2022, there were 2.2 million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.89 million to HIV infection, 0.73 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking and 0.37 million to diabetes.

Investments to end TB

US$ 13 billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets agreed on at the UN high level-TB meeting.

As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2022 (80%) was from domestic sources. In low- and middle-income countries, international donor funding remains crucial. The main source is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund). The United States Government is the largest contributor of funding to the Global Fund and also the largest bilateral donor. For research and development, according to the Treatment Action Group, only US$ 1 billion were available in 2022 of the US$ 2 billion required per year to accelerate the development of new tools. At least an extra US$ 1 billion per year is needed to accelerate the development of new tools.

WHO response

WHO is working closely with countries, partners and civil society in scaling up the TB response. Six core functions are being pursued by WHO to contribute to achieving the targets of the UN high-level meeting political declaration, Sustainable Development Goals, End TB Strategy and WHO strategic priorities:",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis,-1,,eng-9038865,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Following devastating outbreaks in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016 that saw exportation of cases to China, the EYE Strategy - a global coalition of over 50 partners in 40 countries - was launched to accelerate efforts to prevent outbreaks, protect at-risk populations, and save lives across the continent.

The global strategy addresses several challenges including yellow fever's changing epidemiology; the worldwide resurgence of the primary vector responsible for urban yellow fever outbreaks (aedes aegypti mosquito), and the increasing risk of international spread.

An independent mid-term evaluation of the EYE Strategy (covering 2017 to 2021), was undertaken by the Euro Health Group - with guidance from WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi evaluation offices - as an opportunity to take stock of the Strategy's progress to date and to determine how best to move closer to protecting almost 1 billion people in Africa and in the Americas from yellow fever by 2026.

Since 2017, according to EYE Strategy data, 226 million more people in Africa have been protected from yellow fever via a single-dose vaccine that provides lifelong protection. Under the previous yellow fever initiative, 108 million people were protected in an 8-year period. The EYE Strategy's global coalition has contributed to the acceleration of vaccination during this period.

""The EYE Strategy has worked closely with Member States and communities through integrated programmes to rapidly respond to outbreaks of yellow fever. This has been done through enhancing vaccine coverage, surveillance, and diagnostics to curb the deadly impact of this disease in Africa and the Americas,"" says Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. ""We have seen a resurgence of outbreaks of this disease in previously immunized areas, with risk in urban centres, which tells us the threat is far from over. Evidence shows that we are on the path to eliminating yellow fever epidemics, but our work is not yet done.""

On the Strategy's historic immunization milestone Dr Kate O'Brien, Director of WHO's Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals states, ""The evaluation evidence shows that through collaboration and co-ordinated action, the EYE Strategy has yielded significant results. Yellow fever vaccination campaigns have protected 226 million people in Africa since it was launched in 2017[BAR1] , and most high-risk countries have introduced the yellow fever vaccine into their routine immunization schedules. This has helped to prevent major disease outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the numbers of unvaccinated children remain high, and we must continue to work successfully in partnership to ensure those gaps are filled quickly through improvements to essential immunization programmes and vaccination campaigns when needed.""

The evaluation report shows that despite the significant achievements of the Strategy, there are challenges. Key gaps include low prioritization of yellow fever due to competing public health priorities in countries, and the need for increased engagement by governments to implement prevention and control measures, which can include targeted catch-up vaccination campaigns to fill immunization gaps. There also needs to be a continued focus on outbreak preparedness, readiness, and response.

""In July 2023, WHO and UNICEF published updated data for 2022 on the number of children who have missed out on critical vaccinations as part of their country's routine immunization schedules,"" says Dr Ephrem Lemango, Associate Director and Chief of Immunization at UNICEF. ""Although we are making good progress after the disruption of the pandemic, there is still work to be done to ensure that governments continue to prioritize yellow fever. It is possible to eliminate these epidemics in our lifetime.""

With climate change and the rise in environmental issues, such as deforestation, yellow fever continues to threaten the health and livelihoods of vulnerable populations, especially in densely populated cities. These factors pose the greatest threat of catastrophic outbreaks and international exportation of the disease, risking multi-country epidemics and putting global health security at risk.

""The recent rise in outbreaks and the risks they entail are why the introduction of the yellow fever vaccine into routine immunization programmes is so important."" said Dr Kelechi Ohiri, Managing Director of Policy, Programme Design & Delivery Support at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. ""We will continue to work with countries and partners supporting routine introductions, filling immunization gaps, and improving readiness for outbreak response so that we achieve our common goals.""

Yellow fever is endemic in multiple countries in both Africa and the Americas. A deep dive into best practices and lessons learned in Brazil and Ghana are also included in the report (links in country names). Both countries have a history of yellow fever outbreaks and have implemented preventive mass vaccination campaigns.

The EYE partners are committed to intensifying efforts across both continents to support nations implementing the Strategy and to ensure a world free from yellow fever epidemics by 2026.

As of 3 November, according to Ministry of Health data, 2326 women and 3760 children have been killed in the Gaza strip, representing 67% of all casualties, while thousands more have been injured. This means that 420 children are killed or injured every day, some of them only a few months old.

The bombardments, damaged or non-functioning health facilities, massive levels of displacement, collapsing water and electricity supplies as well as restricted access to food and medicines, are severely disrupting maternal, newborn, and child health services. There are an estimated 50 000 pregnant women in Gaza, with more than 180 giving birth every day. Fifteen per cent of them are likely to experience pregnancy or birth-related complications and need additional medical care.

These women are unable to access the emergency obstetric services they need to give birth safely and care for their newborns. With 14 hospitals and 45 primary health care centres closed, some women are having to give birth in shelters, in their homes, in the streets amid rubble, or in overwhelmed healthcare facilities, where sanitation is worsening, and the risk of infection and medical complications is on the rise. Health facilities are also coming under fire - on 1 November Al Hilo Hospital, a crucial maternity hospital, was shelled.

Maternal deaths are expected to increase given the lack of access to adequate care. The psychological toll of the hostilities also has direct - and sometimes deadly - consequences on reproductive health, including a rise in stress-induced miscarriages, stillbirths and premature births.

Prior to the escalation, malnutrition was already high among pregnant women, with impacts on childhood survival and development. As access to food and water worsens, mothers are struggling to feed and care for their families, increasing risks of malnutrition, disease and death.

The lives of newborns also hang by a thread. If hospitals run out of fuel, the lives of an estimated 130 premature babies who rely on neonatal and intensive care services will be threatened, as incubators and other medical equipment will no longer function.

Over half of the population of Gaza is now sheltering in UNRWA facilities in dire conditions, with inadequate water and food supplies, which is causing hunger and malnutrition, dehydration and the spread of waterborne diseases. According to initial assessments by UNRWA, 4600 displaced pregnant women and about 380 newborns living in these facilities require medical attention. Already more than 22 500 cases of acute respiratory infections have been reported along with 12 000 cases of diarrhoea, which are particularly concerning given the high rates of malnutrition.

Despite the lack of sustained and safe access, UN agencies have dispatched life-saving medicines and equipment to Gaza, including supplies for newborns and reproductive health care. But much more is needed to meet the immense needs of civilians, including pregnant women, children and newborns. Humanitarian agencies urgently need sustained and safe access to bring more medicines, food, water and fuel into Gaza. No fuel has come into the Gaza Strip since 7 October. Aid agencies must receive fuel immediately to be able to continue supporting hospitals, water plants and bakeries.

An immediate humanitarian pause is needed to alleviate the suffering and prevent a desperate situation from becoming catastrophic.

All parties to the conflict must abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure including health care. All civilians, including the hostages currently held in Gaza, have the right to health care. All hostages must be released without delay or conditions.

In particular, all parties must protect children from harm and afford them the special protection to which they are entitled under international humanitarian and human rights laws.",https://www.who.int/news/item/03-11-2023-women-and-newborns-bearing-the-brunt-of-the-conflict-in-gaza-un-agencies-warn,-1,,eng-9022392,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Bangladesh has become the first country globally to be validated for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar, a life-threatening neglected tropical disease. The country achieved the elimination target of less than one case per 10,000 population at the sub-district (upazilla) level in 2017 and has sustained it to date despite disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Maldives is the first country to verify interruption of transmission of leprosy, having achieved the milestone of no child case detection for more than five consecutive years. In 2019 Maldives published a 'Framework for Zero leprosy' with clear milestones to reach leprosy elimination by 2030. An independent assessment team by WHO highlighted high political will and community motivation, along with strong health systems and minimal evidence of stigma and discrimination towards persons affected by leprosy, as the key factors for Maldives' success.

The WHO South-East Asia Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination, at its extended eighth meeting held virtually on 3 October, based on the evidence provided by the National Verification Committee of Democratic People's Republic of Korea, concluded that endemic rubella virus has been eliminated from the country. DPR Korea introduced measles-rubella vaccine in childhood immunization programme in November 2019 after successfully carrying out a wide age range immunization campaign targeting 9 months to 15 years old children and 16 to 18 years old women with measles and rubella vaccines. Through this mass immunization activity, achieving more than 99.8% coverage in almost 6 million target population, the country rapidly built substantial population immunity for rubella.

Regional Director Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh felicitated Bangladesh, Maldives and DPR Korea for these public health achievements, at the ongoing Seventy-sixth Regional Committee Session. She also felicitated Bangladesh for elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, and Bhutan and Timor-Leste for eliminating rubella, these successes were achieved earlier this year.

""Neglected tropical diseases like lymphatic filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis and leprosy, along with the threat to children and young people posed by rubella, require continued national leadership, commitment and collaborative action by countries and health partners worldwide,"" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""I salute the great progress made, in line with WHO guidance, by Bangladesh and Maldives on protecting their populations from such NTDs, and from Bhutan, DPR Korea and Timor-Leste for their work to eliminate rubella as a public health threat. These achievements will positively impact the lives of the most vulnerable populations now and in the future.""

""These are tremendous achievements, an outcome of a deeply held strategic vision and culture that together, over the past decade and beyond, we have created. A vision and culture that strives to advance the health and well-being not of some, or even many people, but of all people, everywhere,"" Dr Khetrapal Singh said.

Elimination of neglected tropical diseases and childhood killer and debilitating diseases measles and rubella have been among the eight flagship priority programmes of the WHO South-East Asia Region since 2014.

With WHO and Member countries focusing on the flagships, which are in sync with SDG targets and WHO global priorities, the Region has been witnessing significant advances. Five of the 11 Member countries - Bhutan, DPR Korea, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste- have achieved the regional target of measles and rubella elimination.

Among neglected tropical diseases, the Region has been focusing on trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis / kala-azar, yaws, and leprosy. Four countries - Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Bangladesh - have eliminated lymphatic filariasis. Nepal and Myanmar have eliminated trachoma, and India has been verified yaws-free.

Like many neglected tropical diseases, WHO South-East Asia Region historically accounted for substantial disease burden of kala-azar with Bangladesh, India, and Nepal accounting for 70% of the global cases between 2004 and 2008. The three countries and WHO signed an MoU in 2005 launching the Regional Kala-Azar Elimination Initiative. The MoU was renewed in 2014 with inclusion of Bhutan and Thailand.

Since 2005 Member countries and WHO have been making concerted efforts to strengthen case management, integrated vector management, effective disease surveillance, social mobilization and operational research, as part of the first Regional Strategic Framework for Elimination of Kala-azar in South-East Asia Region. The Region has witnessed 95% decline in new cases of kala-azar in the last 10 years. By 2022, only one percent of the implementation units (areas being focused upon with kala-azar elimination efforts) were left to achieve the elimination target of less than one case per 10,000 population.

The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and WHO, the Government of Bangladesh and partners such as the Government of the United Kingdom, Gilead Sciences, Inc., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, supported research and development of new diagnostic tools and effective treatments, and their roll-out, that helped accelerate the elimination of kala-azar in Bangladesh.

Why should you care about data? How can health data help you? Here to talk to us about it is Dr Samira Asma. Welcome, Samira. Samira talk to us about what health data can do for us. Why should we care about it?

SA Vismita why we should care about data is that data is just not about numbers. Data is about life and death and quality of life. Data is about people we interact with every day - our mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and children. Data is used to empower them. And data is also used to hold ourselves accountable as well as the world accountable for the right decisions we should make to make the environments healthier for populations. Let me start by a basic question. Is that, what kills most of the people? The fact of the matter is, today many of the deaths go unrecorded and we don't know for many deaths and many people - what kills them? The cause of death is not recorded and with that, we have a blind spot. And data truly tells us where to invest, where to make a difference. Without data, we are truly flying blind.

VGS So Samira, what you're describing is if we don't have data on births and deaths, clearly there is missing data a lot of the times probably misrepresented data. So actually, give us some examples of when health data has been used to save lives.

And we have very good cases, for example, from Philippines and Thailand, where those governments had the foresight and increased tobacco price as a result of tobacco taxation and revenues were generated that resulted in that these governments were able to fund their healthcare systems and health promotion in their respective countries. But we want more countries to use this evidence and data to drive these promising policies.

VGS WHO works with data all the time, and a lot of the times data will be questioned when we generate a report. Talk to us about how WHO works with data and how can people know that they are looking at data that is robust.

SA It has been a challenge to gather real time information on the COVID-19 infections and deaths related to the virus and associated with COVID-19. There is often a delay in countries reporting to WHO data because of lack of capacity or lag time in submitting data to WHO. But what happened with the COVID-19 pandemic is we reported excess deaths for the first two years of the pandemic and excess deaths is both the direct and the indirect deaths related to COVID-19 pandemic.

What WHO does to produce such estimates is we work with world class experts from all over the world. We come up with a methodology that we will use when we gather data and apply that methodology to address some of the gaps and challenges that I mention that not all countries have similar access to generate and capture that data.

And then we produce these estimates, but we consult with the countries and there is a lot of back and forth that happens. And we update the estimates and we continue to track population health trends in the quest to make the world healthier and protect people from health emergencies.

VGS So does that worry you when you work with data? When WHO's data is questioned?

SA It is all about finding the truth. It is like climbing a mountain. Then you keep working towards it and climb upwards - you have a better view. So where as we work with data and we gather more information from different sources, we have a better understanding and a better view. There is no absolute. When anyone says anyone is 100% accurate we truly have to be cautious. Science doesn't work that way. We have to continue to learn and continue to refine our approaches so that we get closer to the truth.

VGS Thank you, Samira. That was Science in Five today. Until next time then, stay safe, stay healthy and stick with science.",https://www.who.int/podcasts/episode/science-in-5/episode--106---why-should-you-care-about-data,-1,,eng-9011287,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

WHO/Europe recently launched a seasonal campaign to protect populations and health systems against the cumulative impact of these circulating viruses.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is now one of several circulating respiratory viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and continues to present a serious public health risk. WHO/Europe is implementing a transition plan that includes several shifts and expansions in the approach to collaborative surveillance for COVID-19, influenza and other respiratory infections.

Changes in testing, genomic characterization and reporting across many countries mean that reported data on COVID-19 cases need to be interpreted with caution. Indicators from a range of established systems such as sentinel surveillance in primary and secondary care, and novel systems such as wastewater monitoring, provide a better understanding of the intensity of transmission, disease severity and viral evolution of these viruses.

Additionally, systems measuring intensive care unit occupancy, hospital bed occupancy and excess all-cause mortality across age groups will support country planning and estimates of the burden of disease.

As part of this change, WHO/Europe has made several changes to its respiratory virus surveillance and data reporting systems.

Reflecting some of these changes, WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have launched the weekly European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS). The new online platform displays integrated surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19 and RSV in the WHO European Region, including the European Union/European Economic Area.

ERVISS will also contribute to the new WHO/Europe COVID-19 Information and Data Hub, a comprehensive resource that provides links to the most current health information, datasets and products related to COVID-19.

Dr Richard Pebody, WHO/Europe's Programme Area Manager for Infectious Hazard Management, explained the move.

""We have been working for some time with Member States as they move their respiratory surveillance systems from pandemic mode to a more routine, sustainable, integrated approach, combining COVID-19 with other respiratory viruses. Together with ECDC support, we have provided guidance to Member States across the Region on what those national surveillance systems should look like.""

Dr Pebody continued, ""This will help countries to better implement those public health and social measures which are common to some of these viruses, plan hospital bed capacity and implement vaccine programmes more holistically.""

He added, ""Surveillance systems at a national level should be focused on well designed, representative national sentinel monitoring in primary and secondary care, but should also include a mosaic of complementary data systems to ensure a full and integrated virologic and epidemiologic picture. Pre-pandemic, only influenza was vaccine-preventable, but surveillance is even more important now, to monitor activity for planning coronavirus vaccines and soon-to-be-introduced RSV vaccines.""

The ERVISS system objectives are to:

The Information and Data Hub will also include WHO/Europe's Public Health and Social Measures Monitoring platform and the WHO/Europe COVID-19 Vaccine Programme Monitor, as well as databases on COVID-19-related health information that will continue to be accessible for historical reference.

These systems are critical to ensuring that respiratory viruses are monitored optimally and together to guide timely, appropriate, holistic control and prevention measures. They will also be key in the detection and monitoring of future pandemics.

Dr Catherine Smallwood, WHO/Europe's COVID-19 Incident Manager, said, ""The COVID-19 Situation in the WHO European Region dashboard played a pivotal role in providing essential information during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the landscape of this has now shifted, and so have data needs. This is why the creation of the new Information and Data Hub is so important. This will be developed and expanded to cover future health threats.""",https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/25-10-2023-who-europe-launches-new-platforms-to-track-and-share-real-time-data-on-respiratory-viruses,-1,,eng-8997948,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness, affecting a person's ability to move freely.

Osteoarthritis affects the entire joint, including the tissues around it. It is most common in the knees, hips, spine and hands.

Many factors can contribute to developing osteoarthritis. Some include a history of joint injury or overuse, older age and being overweight. It affects women more than men.

Exercise and healthy eating to build strong muscles and keep a healthy weight can reduce symptoms. Surgery to replace joints is used in severe cases to reduce pain and regain mobility.

Once pain and loss of movement function become chronic, people with osteoarthritis often experience restrictions in participating in meaningful activities, decreased well-being, and psychological distress.

Scope of the problem

Osteoarthritis is one of the significant contributors to years lived with disability among the musculoskeletal conditions. As osteoarthritis is more prevalent in older people (about 70% are older than 55), global prevalence is expected to increase with the ageing of populations. The typical onset is in the late 40s to mid-50s, although osteoarthritis may also affect younger people, including athletes and people who sustain joint injury or trauma. About 60% of people living with osteoarthritis are women.

Signs and symptoms

Symptoms of osteoarthritis include pain, swelling, stiffness and trouble moving the affected joint.

As a consequence of reduced movement, muscles often lose strength and people become less able to perform physical activities.

Osteoarthritis can affect any joint but is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints in the hands. Muscles and tissue around the joint are often affected.

Symptoms can develop slowly or start quickly after an injury or strain. Osteoarthritis is chronic and often progressive, so changes happen gradually over time.

In severe cases, it can make the joint unusable and cause long-term pain. Some people feel pain even when resting.

Being less physically active can lead to other conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes.

Osteoarthritis can greatly reduce the quality of life. It makes movement painful and difficult, which can stop people from participating in home, work or social activities. This can lead to mental health impacts, trouble sleeping and problems in relationships.

Cause and risk factors

Several risk factors are known to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis:

Prevention and control

Several key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent osteoarthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing overuse of joints (e.g. related to workload), and promoting healthy lifestyles (e.g. regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight) play an important role.

Treatment and management

Management of osteoarthritis often involves different health workers, who contribute to a rehabilitative strategy tailored to a person's needs and preferences.

Being diagnosed early and following a treatment plan is the best way to slow the disease and optimize function.

Exercise can strengthen the affected muscles and help mobility. Other therapeutic approaches can help the joint to move properly and allow people to continue their daily activities.

Braces and other assistive technologies can help people to stay independent when movement becomes more difficult.

Medicines like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed to control pain.

Joint replacement surgery can reduce pain, restore movement and improve quality of life for most people with severely affected joints. These surgeries are most commonly performed at the hip and knee.

It is important to stay at a healthy weight. Education and counselling are important to help people manage their symptoms and work-related tasks.

Most guidelines suggest that opioid analgesics, glucosamine and visco-supplementation therapies are not effective for osteoarthritis and there is insufficient evidence to suggest stem cell therapy is beneficial.

Self-care

Self-care is an important part of managing osteoarthritis. Education and support can help people learn to cope with the physical and mental effects of osteoarthritis. People with osteoarthritis should speak to a health worker to build a tailored care plan.

Staying active and maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce symptoms and the risk of their progression.

WHO response

WHO is taking action to extend access to care for people with osteoarthritis in different ways:

WHO Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:

The Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation provides information on essential interventions for rehabilitation (including assistive products), and human and material resources for 20 health conditions, including osteoarthritis.

UN Decade of Healthy Ageing:

WHO recommends a reorientation of health and care systems to promote healthy ageing and address the diverse needs of older persons.

The Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) approach promotes the person-centred assessment of the older person to guide the design of personalized, health and social care, including long-term care interventions. Specific recommendations are provided to prevent the loss of locomotor and psychological capacity because of pain.

This year's list includes two firsts:

Hepatitis E occurs around the world both as outbreaks and as sporadic cases. While most people recover completely, a small proportion (up to 4%) develop acute liver failure, which is higher in pregnant women (mortality rates 19.3-63.6%). Hepatitis E infection is under-reported and the addition of these diagnostics will support governments to manage outbreaks.

Diabetes is a chronic disease causing 1.5 million deaths in 2019 with higher disease incidence and impact in lower-middle-income countries. The disease consequence can be avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular glucose monitoring. Including personal glucose testing devices on the Essential Diagnostics List could lead to better disease management and reduced negative outcomes.

While not prescriptive, the Essential Diagnostics List has the potential to help countries with their plans to improve access to in vitro diagnostics by providing a policy framework to enable informed decision-making for national Essential Diagnostics Lists. The ambition is that governments can use the List to improve in vitro diagnostics testing services in their country which will translate into increased access to diagnostics and better patient outcomes.

""The rapid development and global deployment of diagnostics early in the COVID-19 pandemic was vital in tracking the spread of the virus, detecting, isolating and treating those infected and protecting those at risk,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""The WHO Essential Diagnostics List is a critical tool that gives countries evidence-based recommendations to guide local decisions to ensure the most important and reliable diagnostics are available to health workers and patients.""

For the 2023 Essential Diagnostics List, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on in vitro diagnostics (SAGE IVD) reviewed 12 applications and recommended the addition of eight in IVDs and several edits to previously listed EDL tests, including IVDs for tuberculosis, HIV and diabetes mellitus.

Other new tests added to the list include those for endocrine disorders; reproductive, maternal and new-born health; and cardiovascular health:

With the recent adoption of the WHA 76.5 resolution on strengthening diagnostics capacity, Member States are urged to consider the establishment of national diagnostics strategies as part of their national health plans, and to consider the development of national essential diagnostics lists, adapting the WHO model list of essential in vitro diagnostics. WHO is advising and supporting multiple countries across the world on their efforts to develop EDLs, through webinars, workshops and direct country support.

Updated biennially, the Essential Diagnostics List is intended to support national in vitro diagnostics policy development and to improve access to IVD testing and clinical laboratory services.

From 4 July to 13 October 2023, a total of 538 cases of diphtheria, were reported in the Kankan region, in the east-central part of Guinea. Of the total cases reported, 520 are suspected and 18 confirmed with 58 deaths including 13 among confirmed cases (case fatality rate (CFR) among all cases, 11%). The 1-4 years age group accounted for the largest proportion of reported cases. Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae which can be fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%. Diphtheria remains a significant health problem in countries with poor routine vaccination coverage. According to WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC), the immunization coverage with the diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) containing vaccine was reported to be 47% for 2022 in Guinea and has remained below 50% since 2014. This is insufficient for achieving the coverage of 80-85% required to maintain community protection. WHO assesses the risk of diphtheria to be high in Guinea, considering the chronically low vaccination coverage.

On 5 September 2023, the Ministry of Health notified WHO of the current diphtheria outbreak in Guinea. On 4 July 2023, two children aged 2 and 4 years, attended the otolaryngology department of the Siguiri prefectural hospital in the Kankan region of Guinea, for similar symptoms (dyspnea, dysphasia, fever, cough). They were hospitalized for tonsillitis and respiratory infection and received antibiotic treatment before being referred to the Kankan regional hospital for additional care.

Since 4 July and as of 13 October 2023, 538 cases have been reported, including 18 confirmed cases. In total, 58 deaths including 13 among confirmed cases were registered (case fatality rate (CFR) among all cases, 11%)., and 461 contacts are being followed up. Of the cases reported, 62% are female. The 1-4 years age group, with 445 cases, accounted for the largest proportion of reported cases, 82%, followed by the 5-9 years age group, with 5% and 5% for the 10 years and above age group. Children under the age of 12 months make up 7% of reported cases. None of the 538 cases were vaccinated.

Kankan Region is divided into five prefectures and only the KÃ©rouanÃ© prefecture has not reported any cases to date.

The prefecture of Siguiri is the most affected, with 510 cases (95%). Of the 363 patients admitted to the treatment centers in Siguiri, 37 (10%) have died.

Other prefectures reporting cases are Mandiana (13 cases), Kankan (13 cases) and Kouroussa (two cases). Of the 15 patients admitted in the treatment center in Kankan, 12 (80%) have died.

The treatment centers in the country do not have the capacity in terms of human resources and material for adequate case management. Suspected and confirmed cases were treated with Amoxicillin and Azithromycin as first line therapy. Antibiotic prophylaxis (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin) was administered to the direct contacts.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation around the body and commonly presents with pain in the joints.

Untreated, RA can cause severe damage to the joints and their surrounding tissue. It can lead to heart, lung or nervous system problems.

Common symptoms include chronic pain, stiffness, tenderness, heat and swelling in the joints. RA can make it hard to move and perform daily activities.

The causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Risk factors include smoking, obesity and exposure to air pollution. Women and older people have a higher risk of developing RA.

If diagnosed timely, symptoms and disease progression can be controlled with pharmacological treatment, and optimal functioning can be maintained through rehabilitation (including the use of assistive products). In cases with severe joint damage, surgical procedures, including joint replacement, may help to restore movement or manage pain, and maintain physical function.

The typical onset of the disease occurs in adults in their sixties. Women are two-to-three times more often affected than men. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is higher in industrialized countries, which may be explained by demographics (higher average age), exposures to environmental toxins and lifestyle risk factors, and under-diagnosis in low-and-middle-income countries.

Rheumatoid arthritis causes inflammation and pain in one or more joints. It can happen in most joints, but it's most common in the small joints of the hands, wrists and feet.

RA is chronic and may worsen over time without treatment. It can lead to severe damage to the joint and surrounding tissue. It can also affect the heart, lung and nervous systems.

Early signs and symptoms:

The symptoms can worsen over time and spread to more joints including the knees, elbows or shoulders. RA can make it hard to perform daily activities like writing, holding objects with the hands, walking and climbing stairs.

People with RA often feel fatigue and general malaise (e.g., fever, poor sleep quality, loss of appetite) and may experience depressive symptoms.

Pain and difficulty moving can lead to problems with sexual function and intimate relationships. Trouble moving easily can cause lower physical fitness and lead to loss of independence, inability to work, reduced well-being and mental health problems.

The specific causes for the disease are still unknown, but several modifiable lifestyle-associated (smoking, obesity) and non-modifiable (genetics, female gender, age) risk factors have been identified.

Several key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent rheumatoid arthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing exposure to inhaled silica, dusts and occupational risks, and lifestyle related behaviours (e.g., prevention of/stop smoking, healthy nutrition, physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, maintaining good dental hygiene) play an important role. Some evidence also suggests breastfeeding may be protective to the mother (4).

Rheumatoid arthritis is not curable. Management of rheumatoid arthritis often involves different health workers, who contribute to a rehabilitative strategy tailored to a person's needs and preferences.

Early diagnosis and management can reduce symptoms, slow the disease and prevent disability. In some cases, the disease can go into remission.

Therapeutic approaches help to improve and maintain joint mobility and muscle strength, to reduce and cope with pain, and to increase exercise capacity and the ability to perform daily activities.

Assistive technologies (e.g., orthosis, assistive products for self-care) help people to protect their joints and to perform meaningful activities independently.

Medicines to reduce inflammation, pain and swelling may include:

In severe cases, orthopaedic surgery can reduce pain and restore movement. Rehabilitation is essential to achieve the best outcomes following surgery.

It is important to keep a healthy lifestyle. Education and counselling are important to help people manage their symptoms and work-related tasks.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic condition that impacts many aspects of life. Lifestyle changes are often needed for individuals and their families.

Education and support help people with rheumatoid arthritis to develop strategies to cope with the disease. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular physical activity and a nutritious diet.

WHO is taking action to extend access to care in rheumatoid arthritis in different ways:

WHO Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:

The Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation provides information on essential interventions for rehabilitation (including assistive products), and human and material resources for 20 health conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.

UN Decade of Healthy Ageing:

WHO recommends a reorientation of health and care systems to promote healthy ageing and address the diverse needs of older persons.

The Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) approach promotes the person-centred assessment of the older person to guide the design of personalized, health and social care, including long-term care interventions. Specific recommendations are provided to prevent the loss of locomotor and psychological capacity because of pain.

We take vision for granted, but without vision, we struggle to learn, to walk, to read, to participate in school and to work.

Vision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual system and its vision functions. Everyone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye condition in their lifetime that will require appropriate care.

Vision impairment has serious consequences for the individual across the life course. Many of these consequences can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care. Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness - such as cataract or refractive error - are, for good reasons, the main focus of eye care strategies; nevertheless, the importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment - such as dry eye or conjunctivitis - must not be overlooked. These conditions are frequently among the leading reasons for presentation to eye care services.

Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness are:

There is substantial variation in the causes of vision impairment between and within countries according to the availability of eye care services, their affordability, and the education of the population. For example, the proportion of vision impairment attributable to unoperated cataract is higher in low- and middle-income countries. In high income countries, diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are more common.

Among children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity.

Uncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children and adult populations.

Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. In at least 1 billion - or almost half - of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.

Among this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million) (1). The main condition causing near vision impairment is presbyopia (826 million) (2).

In terms of regional differences, the prevalence of distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is estimated to be 4 times higher than in high-income regions (1). With regards to near vision, rates of unaddressed near vision impairment are estimated to be greater than 80% in western, eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, while comparative rates in high-income regions of North America, Australasia, western Europe, and of Asia-Pacific are reported to be lower than 10% (2).

Population growth and ageing are expected to increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment.

Young children with early onset irreversible severe vision impairment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences. School-age children with vision impairment can also experience lower levels of educational achievement.

Vision impairment severely impacts quality of life among adult populations. Adults with vision impairment can experience lower rates of employment and higher rates of depression and anxiety.

In the case of older adults, vision impairment can contribute to social isolation, difficulty walking, a higher risk of falls and fractures, and a greater likelihood of early entry into nursing or care homes.

Vision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden with an estimate annual global productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion purchasing power parity (3). This figure far outweighs the estimated cost gap of addressing the unmet need of vision impairment (estimated at about US$ 25 billion).

There are effective interventions covering promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation which address the needs associated with eye conditions and vision impairment. While many vision loss cases can be prevented (such as those due to infections, trauma, unsafe traditional medicines, perinatal diseases, nutrition-related diseases, unsafe use or self-administration of topical treatment), this is not possible for all. For many eye conditions, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, early detection and timely treatment are crucial to avoid irreversible vision loss. Spectacle correction for refractive error and surgery for cataract are among the most cost-effective of all health-care interventions. Yet, globally only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error have received access to an appropriate pair of spectacles and only 17% of people with vision impairment or blindness due to cataract have received access to quality surgery.

Treatment is also available for many eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, but generate discomfort and pain. Treatment of these conditions is directed at alleviating the symptoms and preventing the evolution towards more severe stages of those diseases.

Vision rehabilitation is very effective in improving functioning for people with an irreversible vision loss that can be caused by eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, consequences of trauma, and age-related macular degeneration.

WHO's work is guided by the recommendations of the WHO World report on vision (2019) and the resolution on ""integrated, people-centred eye care, including preventable blindness and vision impairment"" adopted at the Seventy-third World Health Assembly in 2020. The key proposal is to make integrated people-centred eye care (IPEC) the care model of choice and to ensure its widespread implementation. It is expected that by shaping the global agenda on vision and eye care, the report and resolution will assist Member States and their partners in their efforts to reduce the burden of eye conditions and vision.

This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHO's programmatic coverage targets that will set the country up to achieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before 2030.

WHO commends Egypt for its important achievement.

""Egypt's journey, from having one of the world's highest rates of hepatitis C infection to being on the path to elimination in less than 10 years, is nothing short of astounding,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""Egypt is an example to the world of what can be achieved with modern tools, and political commitment at the highest level to use those tools to prevent infections and save lives. Egypt's success must give all of us hope and motivation to eliminate hepatitis C everywhere.""

WHO notes with appreciation the ongoing commitment of the Ministry of Health and Population to sustain robust screening, care and treatment services for people with HCV. Since Egypt launched its nationwide campaign, - known as the ""100 million seha"" campaign - which means a 100 million healthy lives - it has resulted in testing over 60 million people and treating more than 4 million people. And by doing so, Egypt reduced the incidence of new infections from 300 per 100 0000 in 2014 to 9 per 100 000 in 2022. This is very close to the ultimate goal of hepatitis C elimination of less than 5 per 100 000 new cases per year and similar levels for viral hepatitis deaths.

""Egypt is an inspiration to many other countries who are working towards the elimination of hepatitis C, hepatitis B or mother to child transmission of hepatitis B. Similar achievements are within reach of many countries if they follow Egypt's example - and use the tools available and assure political commitment,"" said Dr Meg Doherty, WHO's Director of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes. ""However, we cannot be complacent as the work for Egypt and other countries is not over; they have achieved the gold tier status on the path to elimination for Hepatitis C, but will need to continue to sustain and step up efforts to reach the final destination of full elimination by 2023. WHO will be with Egypt every step of the way.""

WHO released its second and updated version of the Guidance for country validation of viral hepatitis elimination and path to elimination.

Human rights abuses and coercive practices in mental health care, supported by existing legislation and policies, are still far too common. Involuntary hospitalization and treatment, unsanitary living conditions and physical, psychological, and emotional abuse characterize many mental health services across the world.

While many countries have sought to reform their laws, policies and services since the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, too few have adopted or amended the relevant laws and policies on the scale needed to end abuses and promote human rights in mental health care.

""Mental health is an integral and essential component of the right to health,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""This new guidance will support countries to make the changes needed to provide quality mental health care that assists a person's recovery and respects their dignity, empowering people with mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities to lead full and healthy lives in their communities.""

""Our ambition must be to transform mental health services, not just in their reach, but in their underlying values, so that they are truly responsive to the needs and dignity of the individual. This publication offers guidance on how a rights-based approach can support the transformation needed in mental health systems"" said Volker TÃ¼rk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The majority of reported government expenditure on mental health is allocated to psychiatric hospitals (43% in high-income countries). However, evidence shows that community-based care services are more accessible, cost-efficient and effective in contrast to institutional models of mental health care.

The guidance sets out what needs to be done to accelerate deinstitutionalization and embed a rights-based community approach to mental health care. This includes adopting legislation to gradually replace psychiatric institutions with inclusive community support systems and mainstream services, such as income support, housing assistance and peer support networks.

Ending coercive practices in mental health - such as involuntary detention, forced treatment, seclusion and restraints - is essential in order to respect the right to make decisions about one's own health care and treatment choices.

Moreover, a growing body of evidence sets out how coercive practices negatively impact physical and mental health, often compounding a person's existing condition while alienating them from their support systems.

The guidance proposes legislative provisions to end coercion in mental health services and enshrine free and informed consent as the basis of all mental health-related interventions. It also provides guidance on how more complex and challenging cases can be handled in legislation and policies without recourse to coercive practices.

Recognizing that mental health is not the sole responsibility of the health care sector alone, the new guidance is aimed at all legislators and policy-makers involved in drafting, amending and implementing legislation impacting mental health, such as laws addressing poverty, inequality and discrimination.

The new guidance also provides a checklist to be used by countries to assess and evaluate whether mental health-related legislation is compliant with international human rights obligations. In addition, the guidance also sets out the importance of consulting persons with lived experience and their representative organizations as a critical part of this process, as well as the importance of public education and awareness on rights-based issues.

While the guidance proposes a set of principles and provisions that can be mirrored in national legislation, countries may also adapt and tailor these to their specific circumstances (national context, languages, cultural sensitivities, legal systems, etc.), without compromising human rights standards.

Aside from the first case, whose source of infection is unknown, the other cases were family and hospital contacts of the first case. As of 27 September 2023,1288 contacts of the confirmed cases were traced, including high-risk contacts and healthcare workers, who are under quarantine and monitoring for 21 days. Since 12 September, 387 samples have been tested, of which six cases were positive for Nipah virus infection, and all remaining samples tested negative. Since 15 September, no new cases have been detected. This is the sixth outbreak of Nipah virus in India since 2001.

Nipah virus infection, a zoonotic illness, is spread to humans through contact with infected animals such as bats and pigs. Additionally, direct contact with an infected individual can also lead to transmission, although this route is less common. Those affected by Nipah virus infection may experience severe symptoms, including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. The only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness about the risk factors and preventive measures to protect themselves. Case management should focus on providing patients with supportive care measures and intensive support for severe respiratory and neurologic complications.

State and national authorities activated a multisectoral coordination and response mechanism to contain the spread of the outbreak including enhanced surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory testing of suspected cases and high-risk contacts, hospital preparedness for case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), risk communication and community engagement.

Description of the situation

Between 12 and 15 September 2023, a total of six laboratory-confirmed cases of Nipah virus infection including two deaths were reported by the State Government of Kerala. All confirmed cases were males within the age range of 9 to 45 years old and were reported within the Kozhikode district of Kerala.

The first case whose source of infection is unknown, had pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was admitted at a hospital in late August 2023. He died a few days after admission. The other five confirmed cases were close contacts of the first case including two family members and contacts at the hospital where the first case was treated and died. The second death occurred in an individual who accompanied another patient to the hospital where the first case was being treated. He died after presenting with symptoms of pneumonia.

As of 27 September 2023, 1288 contacts of the confirmed cases have been traced, including high-risk contacts and healthcare workers who treated the confirmed cases and processed their samples. All identified contacts are under quarantine for a period of 21 days. As of 27 September 2023, the four cases remain clinically stable.

The Government's response measures included declaring containment zones in nine villages in the Kozhikode district with movement restrictions, social distancing, and mandatory mask-wearing in public spaces. The government restricted major public events in Kozhikode district until 1 October 2023. Alerts were issued to neighbouring districts and states for enhanced surveillance.

According to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, the virus found in Kerala has been identified as the Indian Genotype or I-Genotype and is similar to the Nipah virus strain found in Bangladesh.

Epidemiology of the disease

Nipah virus infection is an emerging bat-borne zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through infected animals (such as bats and pigs) or food contaminated with saliva, urine, and excreta of infected animals. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person through close contact with an infected person (although this represents a less common transmission route).

Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. The case-fatality rates in outbreaks across Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore typically range from 40% to 100%. As of now, there are no available effective therapies or vaccines for this disease.

The current outbreak is the third Nipah virus outbreak in Kozhikode district, Kerala, the fourth outbreak in Kerala state since 2018 and the sixth outbreak in India. Similar to the previous outbreak in 2018 in Kerala, this outbreak started with the first case and subsequent clustering of cases in family contacts and likely nosocomial transmission in hospitals.

Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by infection. It can be fatal and requires immediate medical care.

Meningitis can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Most infections can be transmitted from person to person. Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases.

Bacterial meningitis is the most common dangerous type of meningitis and can be fatal within 24 hours.

Meningitis can affect people of any age.

There are effective treatments and vaccines against some of the main bacterial causes of meningitis. However, meningitis remains a significant threat around the world.

There are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis:

These bacteria are responsible for more than half of the deaths from meningitis globally and they cause other severe diseases like sepsis and pneumonia.

Other bacteria e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, viruses such as enteroviruses and mumps, fungi, especially Cryptococcus, and parasites like Amoeba are also important causes of meningitis.

Although meningitis affects all ages, young children are most at risk. Newborn babies are at most risk from Group B streptococcus, young children are at higher risk from meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. Adolescents and young adults are at particular risk of meningococcal disease while the elderly are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease.

People all over the world are at risk of meningitis. The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African Meningitis Belt, especially recognised to be at high risk of epidemics of meningococcal but also pneumococcal meningitis.

Higher risk is seen when people are living in close proximity, for example at mass gatherings, in refugee camps, in overcrowded households or in student, military and other occupational settings. Immune deficiencies such as HIV infection or complement deficiency, immunosuppression, and active or passive smoking can also raise the risk of different types of meningitis.

The route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis such as meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are carried in the human nose and throat. They spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Group B streptococcus is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth.

Carriage of these organisms is usually harmless and helps build up immunity against infection, but the bacteria occasionally invade the body causing meningitis and sepsis.

Clinical features of patients with meningitis vary depending on the cause, disease course (acute, subacute or chronic), brain involvement (meningo-encephalitis) and systemic complications (e.g., sepsis).

Common symptoms of meningitis are neck stiffness, fever, confusion or altered mental status, headaches, nausea and vomiting.

Less frequent symptoms are seizures, coma and neurological deficits (for example hearing or vision loss, cognitive impairment, or weakness of the limbs).

Types of meningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms. Symptoms may be stronger in some types of meningitis than in others and require different treatment.

Bacterial meningitis pathogens can cause other symptoms as a result of bloodstream infections (septicaemia), which can quickly lead to sepsis, including:

Babies sometimes have different symptoms than adults:

One in 5 people surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis may have long lasting after-effects. These after-effects include hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory, and communication, as well as scarring and limb amputations after sepsis.

Vaccines offer the best protection against common types of bacterial meningitis.

Vaccines can prevent meningitis caused by:

Bacterial and viral meningitis can spread from person to person. If you live with someone who has either type of meningitis, you should:

Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae disease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists.

In the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80-85% of meningitis epidemics before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive campaigns (since 2010) and into routine immunization programmes (since 2016). Continuing introduction into routine immunization programmes and maintaining high coverage is critical to avoid the resurgence of epidemics.

2. Antibiotics for prevention (chemoprophylaxis)

Antibiotics for close contacts of those with meningococcal disease, when given promptly, decreases the risk of transmission. Outside the African meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts within the household. Within the meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis for close contacts is recommended in non-epidemic situations. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice, and ceftriaxone an alternative.

Identifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal disease is recommended in many countries. Mothers at risk are offered intravenous penicillin during labour to prevent their babies developing Group B streptococcal infection.

Initial diagnosis of meningitis can be made by clinical examination followed by a lumbar puncture. The bacteria can sometimes be seen in microscopic examinations of the spinal fluid. The diagnosis is supported or confirmed by growing the bacteria from specimens of cerebrospinal fluid or blood, by rapid diagnostic tests or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The identification of the serogroups and susceptibility to antibiotics are important to define control measures. Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing identify more differences between strains and inform public health responses.

Meningitis is a medical emergency.

Meningitis is potentially fatal within 24 hours and requires urgent medical attention. It usually cannot be safely cared for at home.

Meningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms. Meningitis can vary in severity, appropriate treatment and care depending on the cause. Meningitis caused by bacteria requires immediate antibiotic treatment.

Any person who shows signs or symptoms or meningitis should seek immediate care at a hospital or health centre. This will verify if a person has meningitis, confirm the cause of infection and determine the right treatment and care.

Meningitis sequelae can have an enormous impact on individuals, families and communities, both financially and emotionally. Sometimes, complications such as deafness, learning impairment or behavioural problems are not recognized by carers and healthcare workers and therefore go untreated.

Those who have lived through meningitis often have health-care needs requiring long-term medical treatments. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from meningitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Despite the high burden of meningitis sequelae on people with meningitis, their families and the community, access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Individuals and families with members disabled by meningitis should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure people disabled by meningitis are able to live full and rewarding lives.

Surveillance, from case detection to investigation and laboratory confirmation is essential to the control of meningitis. Main objectives include:

The global roadmap Defeating Meningitis by 2030 was developed by WHO with the support of many partners. The strategy was approved in the first ever resolution on meningitis by the World Health Assembly in 2020 and endorsed unanimously by WHO member states.

The roadmap sets a comprehensive vision ""Towards a world free of meningitis"" and has 3 visionary goals:

WHO is working on the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in consultation with Member States to address many challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders that exist worldwide.",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis,-1,,,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease affecting the central nervous system. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Yet, rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals. It spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (e.g. eyes, mouth or open wounds). Children between the age of 5 and 14 years are frequent victims.

Rabies is present on all continents except Antarctica, with over 95% of human deaths occurring in Asia and Africa. However, rabies cases are rarely reported and registered numbers differ greatly from the estimated burden.

Rabies is one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) that predominantly affects already marginalized, poor and vulnerable populations. Although effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist for rabies, these are often not readily available or accessible to those in need. Managing a rabies exposure, where the average cost of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is currently estimated at an average of US$ 108 (along with travel costs and loss of income) can be a catastrophic financial burden on affected families whose average daily income may be as low as US$ 1-2 per person.

Every year, more than 29 million people worldwide receive PEP. This is estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of rabies deaths annually. Globally, the economic burden of dog-mediated rabies is estimated at US$ 8.6 billion per year, in addition to uncalculated psychological trauma for individuals and communities.

Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease. Vaccinating dogs, including puppies, is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people because it stops the transmission at its source. Moreover, dog vaccination reduces the need for PEP.

Education on dog behaviour and bite prevention for both children and adults is an essential extension of rabies vaccination programmes and can decrease both the incidence of human rabies and the financial burden of treating dog bites.

Very effective vaccines are available to immunize people after an exposure (as PEP) or before an exposure to rabies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations (such as laboratory workers handling live rabies and rabies-related viruses) and people whose professional or personal activities might lead to direct contact with bats or other mammals that may be infected with rabies (such as animal disease control staff and wildlife rangers).

PrEP might be indicated also for outdoor travellers and people living in remote, highly rabies-endemic areas with limited local access to rabies biologics.

The incubation period for rabies is typically 2-3 months but may vary from 1 week to 1 year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits.

There are two forms of rabies:

Current diagnostic tools are not suitable for detecting rabies infection before the onset of clinical disease. Unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, or a reliable history of contact with a suspected or confirmed rabid animal is available, clinical diagnosis is difficult. Human rabies can be confirmed intra-vitam and post mortem by various diagnostic techniques that detect whole viruses, viral antigens, or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin or saliva).

People are usually infected following a deep bite or scratch from an animal with rabies, which is, in 99% of the cases, a dog. Transmission can also occur if saliva of infected animals comes into direct contact with mucosa (e.g. eyes or mouth) or fresh skin wounds.

In the Americas, hematophagous bats are now the major source of human rabies deaths as dog-mediated transmission has been largely interrupted in this region. Bat-mediated rabies is also an emerging public health threat in Australia and western Europe.

Human deaths following exposure to foxes, raccoons, skunks, jackals, mongooses and other wild carnivore host species are very rare, and bites from rodents are not known to transmit rabies.

Contraction of rabies through inhalation of virus-containing aerosols or through transplantation of infected organs has been described, but is extremely rare. Human-to-human transmission through bites or saliva is theoretically possible but has never been confirmed. The same applies to the transmission to humans via consumption of raw meat or milk of infected animals.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the emergency response to a rabies exposure. This prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system, which would invariably result in death. PEP consists of:

Depending on the severity of the contact with the suspected rabid animal, administration of a full PEP course is recommended as follows:

Category II and III exposures require PEP.

WHO recommends administering rabies vaccines intradermally, as this reduces the amount of necessary vaccine and therefore the cost by 60-80% without compromising any safety or efficacy.

Rabies is included in WHO's 2021-2030 Roadmap for the global control of neglected tropical diseases, which sets regional, progressive targets for the elimination of targeted diseases. Rabies is one of these. As a zoonotic disease, it requires close cross-sectoral coordination at the national, regional and global levels.

The key towards implementing effective rabies elimination programs is to engage with local communities, start small, catalyse long-term investment through stimulus packages, ensure the ownership of governments, demonstrate success and cost-effectiveness, and scale up quickly.

While data for cholera remain inadequate, cases reported to WHO in 2022 were more than double those in 2021. Forty-four countries reported cases, a 25% increase from the 35 countries that reported cases in 2021.

Not only were there more outbreaks, but the outbreaks were larger. Seven countries -Afghanistan, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Nigeria, Somalia, Syrian Arab Republic-have each reported over 10 000 suspected and confirmed cases. The larger the outbreak, the harder it typically is to control.

Cholera is an acute intestinal infection that spreads through food and water contaminated with faeces containing the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is closely linked to the lack of adequate safe water and sanitation, due to underdevelopment, poverty and conflict. Climate change too is playing a role in this upsurge as extreme climate events like floods, droughts and cyclones trigger new outbreaks and worsen existing ones.

Current data for 2023 suggest that this global upsurge is continuing. Twenty-four countries are currently reporting active outbreaks, with some countries in the midst of acute crises.

The increased demand for cholera materials has been a challenge for disease control efforts globally. Since October 2022, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) -- the body which manages emergency supplies of vaccines -- has suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in cholera outbreak response campaigns, using instead a single-dose approach.

WHO is supporting countries to respond to cholera outbreaks on an emergency footing through the strengthening of public health surveillance, case management, and prevention measures; providing essential medical supplies; coordinating field deployments with partners; and supporting risk communication and community engagement.WHO has appealed for US$ 160.4 million to respond to cholera through the global",https://www.who.int/news/item/22-09-2023-new-analysis-confirms-world-seeing-an-upsurge-of-cholera,-1,,eng-8921887,"{'uri': 'who.int', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'who.int', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162264, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1298, 'alexaCountryRank': 1813}}",,,TRUE

Speaking in a press conference held prior to the second EAEU exclusive exhibition on Tuesday, Mohammad-Sadegh Ghannadzadeh said: ""Currently, Iran and Eurasia have reached an understanding on the text and list of goods for free trade, and soon in Russia, five EAEU member countries and Iran will sign the agreement, and if approved by the parliament, the FTA will be implemented next year.""

""Based on the FTA, 87 percent of goods will be exchanged between Iran and Eurasia with zero tariffs. But there is always a negative list in free trade agreements. In this agreement, 13 percent of our goods are either on the import ban list or their import tariff will not be

Iran and EAEU reached a preferential trade agreement (PTA) in 2018 based on which about 862 commodity items are currently subject to preferential tariffs. The agreement came into effect on October 27, 2019.

Following the positive impact of the PTA on the trade exchanges between the two sides, Iran and EAEU started negotiating to upgrade the PTA to an FTA.

Back in July, the minister in charge of trade of the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) said that the EAEU's cooperation with Iran is actively expanding in various fields, and trade between the two sides has doubled over the past four years.

At today's late morning snapshot, the bean was trading at $4,362 per tonne, up 84 per cent on this point last year.

The levels surpass even the 2011 peak driven by that year's Ivory Coast export ban on the commodity.

Delayed harvests in the two most important cocoa-producing countries, Ghana and Ivory Coast are worsening already-stringent supplies dating back to the pandemic.

However, supply shortage fears have been widespread throughout the industry for years.

In 2018, the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) projected that the global cocoa supply would fall short of demand by approximately 1m tons annually by 2050 -- a 10 per cent global output decrease.

This has already been felt by shoppers through responsive action taken by some confectionery giants.

In March last year, Mondelez announced it would be reducing the size of the chocolate bars under its Cadbury brand, though prices remained unchanged -- a course of action it announced it wished to pursue.

Mondelez has paid out $2.2bn in shareholder dividends to date this calendar year and recorded $9bn net revenue in Q3 2023.

Mars followed suit in September this year, shedding the weight of its Galaxy Smooth Milk bars from 110g to 100g.

""What we're hearing from some producers in cocoa-producing regions is that companies are putting off purchasing cocoa at these prices,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets for Hargreaves Lansdown.

""This drops demand, meaning the local market falls in price and thereby setting a lower future price.""

Appearing before the Committee on Agriculture and Food of the House of Representatives on Monday, Laurel said he gave importers less than five weeks to use the permits granted to them to buy an additional one million tons of rice from abroad to boost local stocks.

""Sabi ko kapag hindi ninyo iimport yan within 30 days, kakanselahin ko lahat yan because I don't want to be held hostage by permits that were issued to them upon their request,"" Laurel told lawmakers.

By assuring import permits are used quickly, the Department of Agriculture could better manage the supply of rice, the country's main food staple, and avoid price surges that hurt consumers.

The DA expects total palay harvest this year to exceed 20 million metric tons compared to 19.76 million tons last year while total rice imports are projected at 2.86 million tons -- barring additional imports in the coming weeks -- down one million tons from 2022 levels. The DA said that based on current numbers, the country has a rice surplus of 2.98 million metric tons which is enough to last 80 days.

Additional imports would extend that supply period through the next harvest season starting in March. The high global price of rice due mainly to India's ban on export of non-basmati rice, however, has discouraged rice importation.

Meanwhile, House committee chairman Quezon Rep. Wilfrido Mark Enverga sought assurance from the DA that the price of onions would not skyrocket like what happened last year when prices soared to P700 a kilo in December.

Laurel said the prevailing market prices of red and white onion on Monday stood at P140 and P110 per kilo, respectively.

""I'm closely monitoring this (onion prices) and we will take steps para hindi na mangyari yung nangyari noong nakaraang taon,"" the agriculture chief said.

As for sugar, Laurel said there are ample stocks of the commodity, but that supply is already contracted to industrial users.

He said sugar should be sold at P85 a kilo, not P100.

Prices dipped on Monday, but a string of earlier gains helped push US cocoa futures above $4,000 per metric ton, contributing to an appreciation of over 40% for the year.

It's a price not seen since 1978, Bloomberg reported, and surpasses the 2011 peak that resulted from that year's Ivory Coast export ban on cocoa. But it's still well below the 1977's high of $5,379 per metric ton.

This time around, delayed harvests are exacerbating shortages that have been ongoing for two years, and the supply crunch is heading into a third year.

Harvesting seasons in both Ghana and the Ivory Coast have fallen behind the pace set last year, with bad weather and crop disease concerns driving the lag.

In late October, bean deliveries to Ivory Coast ports were 16% behind this season, a source told Bloomberg.

Outlooks also remain dim as El Nino threatens to dry out West Africa, a detriment to growers. This comes against rising global demand, with processing improving in Europe, Brazil, and the Ivory Coast.

The first annual settlement between a major miner -- in recent years Freeport or Antofagasta -- and leading Chinese smelters in the fourth quarter tends to become the benchmark for the rest of the industry for the year ahead. No offer has been heard from Freeport for the 2024 benchmark yet.

The settled TC/RC between Antofagasta and Jinchuan Group was $8/mt or 0.8 cent/lb lower than the benchmark level for 2023 term contracts, marking the first decline since 2021, which indicated an expectation of tightening copper concentrates supply in 2024.

Some other smelters followed the price in deals with Antofagasta on Nov. 20, according to two market sources.

A major producer said they will follow $80/mt as the number is reasonable.

However, major Chinese smelters such as Jiangxi Copper, Tongling Nonferrous and China Copper haven't made a final decision on accepting the price, according to a smelter source.

""There is a high possibility that the rest of the Chinese leading smelters will follow the agreed number, based on past experience,"" said a Chinese source.

The settled price was higher than Antofagasta's offer heard on Nov. 15 at $72-$75/mt.

Chinese smelters were reluctant to accept TC/RC below $80/mt, as they held the view that copper concentrates supply would remain in surplus in 2024, while the growth of mining might be slower than the smelting capacity expansion.

The market was closely tracking the protests at Quantum's Cobre Panama mine and an export ban on Indonesian-origin copper concentrates from next May, though it hasn't seen any potential impact on copper concentrates supply for 2024 so far, some sources said.

Looking ahead, global copper concentrates supply might see shortages in 2025, as the expansion of refined copper smelting capacity is expected to be far greater than that of copper concentrate supply, sources said.

Meanwhile, despite the recent decline in copper concentrate TC/RC as well as by-product sulfuric acid prices, Chinese smelters have kept their passion for production so far on expectations that the profit margin may remain healthy.

Tradable values for December- and January-loading clean copper concs were heard around $80/mt from the trader to the smelter, and traders see it sliding further due to ongoing demand.

James Emejo in Abuja

A new crop production report has predicted an increase in prices of all major agricultural commodities predicated on a general decline in production and increasing demand across processing and export value chains.

The APEX Wet Season Crop Production Report 2023 which was launched yesterday, also expressed concern that input lending remained a major challenge in the country as banking sector credit to agriculture stood at barely 6.16 per cent in 2022.

The report further identified food insecurity and food inflation as major challenges confronting the country with a 5.7 million metric ton - deficit across human consumption and agro-processing, as well as a historic high food inflation rate of 30.64 per cent.

Specifically, it noted that paddy rice faced the most notable upswing in 2022/2023, partly due to increased flooding and India's rice export ban which contributed to an increase of 34 per cent to baseline pricing of N353,000/mt.

The report said this was expected to rise to N400,000/mt and projected to stabilise at between N480,000 and N500,000/mt by Q3 2023.

It pointed out that Nigeria's Global Hunger Index score remained alarmingly high at 109th out of 125 countries, indicating a severe food security crisis in the country.

The report noted that food prices continued to surge as witnessed in the 2023 season adding that food security challenges would continue to persist, further reducing the Africa's capacity to achieve zero hunger by 2030.

Speaking at the unveiling of the report in Abuja, President/Chief Executive, AFEX Nigeria, Mr. Akinyinka Akintunde, said, ""This year, we nearly doubled our sample size from 20,677 to 39,091 to get an accurate reflection of the current state of agriculture production, and we found that we must take extra care to prioritise improvement in agricultural productivity for these farmers, and this is hinged on investing in the sector, and solving for infrastructure, logistics, and technology gaps.

""This transformation will substantially enhance food self-sufficiency and increase our ability to meet the nutritional and food security needs of a growing population while also bolstering the economy through foreign exchange earnings.""

Essentially, the study delivers insights into six key commodities including maize, paddy rice, soybean, sorghum, cocoa, and sesame, and leverages farmer surveys and measurement of transaction-level data to track vital information across crop production, price performance, and market dynamics.

Akintunde said the report would aid the understanding of the current food system, which needed urgent transformation while providing stakeholders in the commodities market with intelligence to make data-driven trading decisions in the coming season.

Nonetheless, the survey affirmed critical improvement in access to farmland for cultivation in crucial areas, as well as an increase in the usage of improved inputs, such as high-yielding seeds and fertilizers, compared to the preceding season, which contributed to maize and paddy rice being forecasted to have a significantly higher production in the current season.

It stressed that the shortage of reliable data continued to impact the availability of transparent pricing and limits, and constituted a recurring limitation for agriculture on the continent.

The report, among other things, stated that maize and paddy rice were forecasted to have a significantly higher production this season due to expansion in cultivated land and increased fertilizer usage, compared to last season.

Soybean and Sorghum were also expected to decrease modestly due to challenges around seed and land usage while cocoa also faces a decrease in volume due to aging trees and reduced pesticide with sesame growing due to favourable weather and increased international demand.

It added that global trade commodity exchanges, including AFEX, play pivotal roles in promoting fair pricing, managing risk, broadening market access, driving investment, and establishing and enforcing quality standards for agricultural products.",https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2023/11/17/report-highlights-further-risks-to-food-commodity-prices-in-2023-2024,0,,,"{'uri': 'thisdaylive.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'THISDAYLIVE', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 247134, 'alexaGlobalRank': 12467, 'alexaCountryRank': 106}}",,,TRUE

""LME tin price rallied somewhat this (last) week, approaching $24,800 after a sharp drop to a six-month low at the end of October, amid broader bearish sentiment across base metals,"" said Tom Langston, Senior Market Intelligence Analyst, International Tin Association (ITA).

""...global supplies have tightened over the course of 2023 thus far... TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) believes the semiconductor industry is close to a bottom and about to enter the next cyclical upturn,"" said research agency BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions.

Supply fears

""Tin prices increased by 2 per cent in Q32023 from the previous quarter due to supply disruption concerns. The closure of mines in Myanmar, aimed at preserving remaining tin resources, is impacting China's raw material supply,"" said the World Bank in its Commodity Outlook.

Tin mining and processing operations in Myanmnar's key-producing region of Wa have remained suspended since August. The region accounts for nearly one-sixth of the global production and is the main supplier for manufacturers in China.

""Consequently, the world's top consumer was forced to seek tin from alternative sources, driving imports from the Democratic Republic of Congo to soar by 24 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, raising buying competition in other global benchmarks,"" said the Trading Economics website.

Myanmar ban

""Along with rising tin demand from the semiconductor industry, the banning of tin mining in Myanmar's Wa region as well as Indonesia's tin ingot export ban will ensure the global tin market remains tight in the coming months,"" said BMI.

Langston said though a demand boost in fourth quarter festival season appeared uncertain, the Chinese electronics market and the solar sector remained bright spots.

""Recent negative updates from Wa State have pushed back mine reopening estimates, bringing supply resilience into sharper focus as we look towards Q1 2024,"" he said.

BMI said it has raised ""slightly"" its tin price forecasts for 2023 to $25,700/tonne from $25,000 previously as prices remain elevated amid improving demand and tight supplies.

Reached a trough

""Global semiconductor sales data show that the decline in demand for semiconductors since mid-2022 has reached its trough, with sales increasing steadily since July 2023,"" the research agency said.

The World Bank, however, said prices of tin -- which is used in photovoltaic installations, electric vehicles, and electronics -- are expected to decrease by an additional 4 per cent in 2024 from 2023.

""Demand for tin, a key component of electronic manufacturers, is expected to remain subdued reflecting weak economic activity in major economies in 2024,"" it said.

BMI anticipates the soldering metal prices to edge higher in 2024 as the seaborne market will witness a fall in supplies as Myanmar's mining ban extends and Indonesia's ban on tin export comes into force.

The research agency forecast global refined tin production to increase by 1.4 per cent year-on-year in 2023. It expects continued supply growth as new projects in Peru and Malaysia realise a full year of output.

It also revised its forecast higher for global refined tin consumption, which will likely grow by 2.3 per cent y-o-y in 2023 and 2.4 per cent y-o-y in 2024.

Meanwhile, the nickel price index appeared decidedly bullish throughout the month.

While nickel prices modestly retraced from their early month rally, upside price action continued to support the short-term range breakout. Sustained increases should foster further bullish anticipation, which could support a continuation of the short-term uptrend. Meanwhile, volumes remained steady coming into December. However, it's important to note how potentially volatile contracts for nickel can become amid low liquidity. This will continue to pose a risk for buyers as price action remains susceptible to a quick reversal.

Service Centers Working Through Stainless Inventory Glut

Service centers, brokers, master distributors, and some end users remain flush with inventory. Most service centers indicated that October shipments were relatively flat compared to September. As a result, many have more than four months of stainless inventory on hand. Service center shipments should decline further as they look to reduce stock before December 31. This is key to improving year-end financials and, in some states, avoiding potential inventory tax liabilities. Although 304 base prices have remained steady throughout the year, this supply glut has added downward pressure to stainless steel spot prices.

Cold Rolled Stainless Shortage Risk Amid Import Declines

Alongside these declining service center shipments, imports have slowed significantly in recent months. Indeed, some industry insiders think all U.S. cold rolled stainless steel products could be under allocation as early as March. Meanwhile, import licenses have also declined. This means that service centers, brokers, and master distributors have all pulled back from buying stainless imports. If history repeats itself, the inventory overhang situation will likely be over-corrected. This will lead to stainless cold rolled shortages until enough imports arrive to fill the gap.

That said, the eroding health of the global economy will continue to pressure overall demand. Indeed, reports are circulating that some Indonesian stainless steel producers suffered losses last month due to reduced domestic and global demand. This triggered some plants to indefinitely reduce output, while others implemented scheduled maintenance.

In the U.S. specifically, the manufacturing sector returned to contractionary territory. In fact, for the first time since May of 2020, the ISM Manufacturing PMI descended beneath the expansion/contraction threshold, reading a mere 49 for November. That said, U.S. manufacturing remains strong relative to other parts of the globe. For example, both the Eurozone and Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMIs have remained below 50 since June.

On Nov. 30, the World Trade Organization (WTO) released its final report on Indonesia's ban on nickel ore exports. As MinerMiner previously noted, the ban went into effect in 2020. At the time, it was part of a larger strategy to attract investments for value-adds to Indonesia's nickel supply chain. The EU challenged the ban on the grounds it unfairly restricted access to key raw materials, specifically for stainless steel producers. As Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, predicted, the WTO ruled in favor of the EU.

According to the decision, the export ban and domestic processing requirements were inconsistent with an article of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade. The specified article prohibits WTO members from banning or restricting imports and exports outside of duties or taxes. Indonesia had justified the ban by stating its measures were ""temporary"" and designed to prevent critical shortages of raw materials. Such a move is indeed permitted by other articles within the agreement.

Despite the loss, Indonesia plans to appeal. As a whole, the ban was wildly successful for the country. Indeed, it will likely serve as an incentive for Indonesia to continue limiting exports in some form. Currently, the country accounts for roughly 38% of global nickel production, giving it significant influence over the nickel price. In fact, due to the investments the ban triggered, the archipelago has since become the second-largest producer of stainless steel.

Of course, the WTO's decision will not undo Indonesia's newfound dominance within global stainless steel production. Many insiders expect Indonesia to adopt some form of export duty allowed by trade regulations in the near future.

How Long Will the Nickel Price Index Remain Bullish?

The nickel price index showed a short-term uptrend last month. However, an element of directional uncertainty remains. The downturn in Europe and the threat of a prolonged recession in the U.S. will continue to drag on prices. As mentioned above, the largest consumer of nickel, stainless steel production, appears to have peaked due to eroding demand.

On top of that, a number of the factors that underpinned last month's bullishness have since evaporated. Contrary to market expectations, the LME chose not to ban or limit Russian material. Albeit less surprising, the removal of Indonesia's export ban will also add downside pressure to the nickel price. That said, this has yet proven sufficient to shift price direction. Moreover, the decision's impact could be further mitigated should Indonesia implement previously announced nickel pig iron (NPI) tariffs or any new duties to replace the ban.

China's shifting approach to zero-COVID served as the other dynamic force. The month opened to rumors of a potential end date, which supported a rally across the base metal category. By mid-month, however, the rallies stagnated amid record outbreaks and new lockdowns. Then, in an unexpected twist, rampant protests and growing social unrest caused Beijing to unravel lockdowns and again loosen restrictions.

China reopening will likely prove a slow process. They currently face a surging exit wave and low public immunity due to lack of exposure. Still, the move will nonetheless have a bullish effect on metal prices as the country's demand reemerges. How bullish remains uncertain as China continues to grapple with other economic challenges, including its property sector crisis, an aging population, and high debt levels.

It's aimed specifically at the electric vehicle market, graphite anode material used in EV batteries.

But as a long term reader, I'm sure this announcement hasn't come as a surprise.

In fact, I warned readers of MINING.com in early October... ""Key Question: Which critical metal will China Ban next?""

Graphite and rare earths were the two commodities flagged as the most likely contenders... That's because China dominates the supply of these two key minerals.

We saw the first shot fired in July after export restrictions were placed over gallium and germanium, key commodities in the manufacture of semiconductors.

Another warning sign... the US Department of Defence has steadily poured billions into critical metal projects over the last 12 months as it scrambles to secure alternative supplies.

The Australian rare earth producer Lynas (ASX: LYC) was one of the big benefactors of the departments attempt to boost domestic supply.

LYC received $120 million last year as part of a deal to build processing facilities on US soil.

But that deal was sweetened after China's germanium and gallium export restriction, the company received a further $258 million in August.

Deals like this have barely raised an eyebrow... That's why last month's graphite export tightening shocked the market into panic buying...

Since the announcement, graphite producer Syrah Resources (ASX: SYR) has climbed more than 60%.

Conditions change rapidly in the commodity market, that's why you should be positioning your portfolio ahead of these events.

The market didn't pay attention to the gallium and germanium trade restrictions in July.

So, will it wake up to the looming supply problems once graphite's stranglehold comes into force on December 1st?

Perhaps.

Especially, when we consider graphite is a far more 'mainstream' commodity.

Its why investors should be broadening their exposure across numerous critical metal stocks set to surge on the back of heightening US and China trade tensions.

There's a real possibility things could escalate further from here...

Russia, a commodity producing powerhouse is in prime position to maximise pain over the west by partnering with China.

A multi-pronged attack placing export bans across numerous critical metals and energy.

This would be devastating to manufacturers across Europe and North America.

As last week's development showed, the threats are real and reaching new levels of risk.

Manufacturing of EV batteries, solar panels, smart phones, laptops, TV's, appliances, medical and defence equipment all hinge on the reliable supply of critical metals.

These raw materials are fed by China's mighty midstream and downstream capacity.

With the flick of a switch the world's most important supplier can cut exports.

This is unfolding far earlier than most geopolitical experts would have expected... Who knows how bad this situation could get in the months to come.

It seems unthinkable that multibillion dollar companies like Tesla, Toyota or BMW would be left stranded without the raw materials needed to build their products.

It's the same situation for the massive US tech and defence companies relying on China's supply of rare earths.

For too long, manufacturers have ignored the importance of investing in upstream supply... Mining.

Their day of reckoning is approaching fast.

Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter, but its durum supplies are comparatively small. It is expected to produce around 750,000 mt durum wheat in marketing year 2023-24 (July-June), up from 735,000 mt in MY 2022-23, trader sources said.

""The government may look at banning exports of durum wheat as domestic food prices have increased,"" a local trader said.

Russia has sold over 400,000 mt durum wheat so far in MY 2023-24, sharply up total 200,000 mt in the previous year, trade participants said.

Durum wheat is used mainly to produce pasta, with Italy being a key importer of Russian wheat. According to data from EU Crop Observatory, Russia has sold 278,472 mt durum wheat to the EU so far in MY 2023-24, up from 15,153 mt in the previous year.

""If Russia stops supplies of durum wheat, it will push prices sharply higher,"" a trader based in Italy said.

Russia is expected to harvest 88.6 million mt ofwheat in MY 2023-24 and is expected to export 47.2 million mt, said Victoria Sinitsyna, senior grains analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights. In MY 2022-23, Russia harvested around 92 million mt ofwheat and shipped out nearly 45.5 million mt, Sinitsyna added.

Global supplies of durum wheat in MY 2023-24 are expected to dwindle due to poor harvests in Canada, the largest producer, due to persistent dry conditions, market participants said.

In MY 2023-24 (August-July), Canada is export 3.3 million mt durum wheat in MY 2023-24, against 5.1 million mt in the previous year, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada reported Oct. 23.

China is the world's top graphite producer and exporter. It also refines more than 90% of the world's graphite into the material that is used in virtually all EV battery anodes, which is the negatively charged portion of a battery.

""This bold and unexpected move by China in graphite has taken us by surprise, arriving far sooner than anyone could have predicted,"" said Kien Huynh, chief commercial officer at Alkemy Capital Investments, which is focused on developing projects in the energy transition metals sector.

Beijing requires the export permits at a time when many foreign governments are ratcheting up pressure on Chinese companies over their industrial practices.

The European Union is weighing levying tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidies. Also, the U.S. government earlier this week widened curbs on Chinese companies' access to semiconductors, including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by Nvidia.

China's graphite curbs are similar to those imposed since Aug. 1 for two chip-making metals, gallium and germanium. The restrictions have slashed exports of those metals recently and pushed up prices outside of the country.

The action is intensifying efforts among miners outside China to bring graphite projects to fruition while efforts to find alternatives will also be ramped up.

""What China is saying to the West with this decision is that we are not going to help you make electric cars, you have to find your own way to do that,"" Northern Graphite CEO Hugues Jacquemin said.

China's commerce ministry said the move on graphite was ""conducive to ensuring the security and stability of the global supply chain and industrial chain, and conducive to better safeguarding national security and interests"".

It added that it was not targeting any specific country. Top buyers of graphite from China include Japan, the United States, India and South Korea, according to Chinese customs data.

Under the new restrictions, China will require as of Dec. 1 that exporters apply for permits to ship two types of graphite, including high-purity, high-hardness and high intensity synthetic graphite material, and natural flake graphite and its products.

Three types of ""highly sensitive"" graphite items had already been under temporary controls, the commerce ministry said, and are included in the new list.

Meanwhile, it dropped temporary controls on five less sensitive graphite items used in basic industries such as steel, metallurgy, and chemicals.

With rising sales of electric vehicles, automakers are racing to lock in supplies from outside China, but shortages are looming.

""With this new graphite export curb, South Korean firms which heavily rely on China for graphite imports would need to seek alternatives, such as mines from the United States or Australia, but it would likely increase the cost burden for many,"" said Kang Dong-jin, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.

South Korea's trade ministry said a statement that it had held a meeting on Friday with battery and material makers on how to respond to the export curbs.

""The South Korean government will closely communicate... to avoid production disruptions in the lithium-ion battery sector,"" South Korea's industry minister Ahn Duk-geun said.

Japan's top government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said on Friday the country plans to ask China about the ""operational policies"" of the new measures and will ""take appropriate steps"" if they violate World Trading Organization rules.

Shares in China's new energy vehicle and battery makers rose after the announcement.

Impact unclear

Analysts said it was not clear how much impact the new measures on graphite will have in the short term.

""This control is not a complete ban, and there has been no significant impact on any industry during the previous temporary control,"" said Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Prices for natural flake graphite were 3,950 yuan ($539.62) a metric ton this week, down 25.5% from the beginning of this year because of declining demand from the EV sector, according to consultancy Mysteel.

""This action could set them on an upward trajectory internationally, while keeping domestic prices low for Chinese battery producers,"" said Tom Kavanagh, head of battery metals at commodity and energy pricing agency Argus.

Still, exports are likely to rise ahead of Dec. 1, said Echo Ma, an analyst at Rystad Energy, especially to countries with established battery industries like Japan, South Korea and the United States.

China has reduced natural graphite mining in recent years to protect the environment, instead ramping up synthetic graphite output since 2021. The synthetic form now accounts for 70% of China's output, according to Mysteel.

Under the new restrictions, China will require as of Dec. 1 that exporters apply for permits to ship two types of graphite, including high-purity, high-hardness and high intensity synthetic graphite material, and natural flake graphite and its products.

China said on Friday it will require export permits for some graphite products to protect national security, springing a surprise with another bid to control critical mineral supply in response to challenges over its global manufacturing dominance. China is the world's top graphite producer and exporter. It also refines more than 90% of the world's graphite into the material that is used in virtually all EV battery anodes, which is the negatively charged portion of a battery.

""This bold and unexpected move by China in graphite has taken us by surprise, arriving far sooner than anyone could have predicted,"" said Kien Huynh, chief commercial officer at Alkemy Capital Investments, which is focused on developing projects in the energy transition metals sector. Beijing requires the export permits at a time when many foreign governments are ratcheting up pressure on Chinese companies over their industrial practices.

The European Union is weighing levying tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidies. Also, the U.S. government earlier this week widened curbs on Chinese companies' access to semiconductors, including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by Nvidia. China's graphite curbs are similar to those imposed since Aug. 1 for two chip-making metals, gallium and germanium. The restrictions have slashed exports of those metals recently and pushed up prices outside of the country.

The action is intensifying efforts among miners outside China to bring graphite projects to fruition while efforts to find alternatives will also be ramped up. ""What China is saying to the West with this decision is that we are not going to help you make electric cars, you have to find your own way to do that,"" Northern Graphite CEO Hugues Jacquemin said.

China's commerce ministry said the move on graphite was ""conducive to ensuring the security and stability of the global supply chain and industrial chain, and conducive to better safeguarding national security and interests"". It added that it was not targeting any specific country. Top buyers of graphite from China include Japan, the United States, India and South Korea, according to Chinese customs data.

Under the new restrictions, China will require as of Dec. 1 that exporters apply for permits to ship two types of graphite, including high-purity, high-hardness and high intensity synthetic graphite material, and natural flake graphite and its products. Three types of ""highly sensitive"" graphite items had already been under temporary controls, the commerce ministry said, and are included in the new list.

Meanwhile, it dropped temporary controls on five less sensitive graphite items used in basic industries such as steel, metallurgy, and chemicals. With rising sales of electric vehicles, automakers are racing to lock in supplies from outside China, but shortages are looming.

""With this new graphite export curb, South Korean firms which heavily rely on China for graphite imports would need to seek alternatives, such as mines from the United States or Australia, but it would likely increase the cost burden for many,"" said Kang Dong-jin, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities. South Korea's trade ministry said a statement that it had held a meeting on Friday with battery and material makers on how to respond to the export curbs.

""The South Korean government will closely communicate... to avoid production disruptions in the lithium-ion battery sector,"" South Korea's industry minister Ahn Duk-geun said. Japan's top government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said on Friday the country plans to ask China about the ""operational policies"" of the new measures and will ""take appropriate steps"" if they violate World Trading Organization rules.

Shares in China's new energy vehicle and battery makers rose after the announcement. IMPACT UNCLEAR

Analysts said it was not clear how much impact the new measures on graphite will have in the short term. ""This control is not a complete ban, and there has been no significant impact on any industry during the previous temporary control,"" said Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Prices for natural flake graphite were 3,950 yuan ($539.62) a metric ton this week, down 25.5% from the beginning of this year because of declining demand from the EV sector, according to consultancy Mysteel. ""This action could set them on an upward trajectory internationally, while keeping domestic prices low for Chinese battery producers,"" said Tom Kavanagh, head of battery metals at commodity and energy pricing agency Argus.

Still, exports are likely to rise ahead of Dec. 1, said Echo Ma, an analyst at Rystad Energy, especially to countries with established battery industries like Japan, South Korea and the United States. China has reduced natural graphite mining in recent years to protect the environment, instead ramping up synthetic graphite output since 2021. The synthetic form now accounts for 70% of China's output, according to Mysteel.

India also cleared exports of the commodity to Nepal, Cameroon, Cote d' Ivoire, Guinea, Malaysia, and the Seychelles, India's director of Foreign Trade said in a statement.

India, the world's largest exporter of white rice, had suspended exports of non-basmati white rice earlier this year amid concerns over domestic supply, putting upward pressure on international prices. White rice is the variety most commonly traded internationally, while basmati is the preferred domestic Indian variety.

The Philippines typically imports rice from Southeast Asia because regional trade agreements grant ASEAN grain a tariff advantage. The food inflation crisis of early 2023 forced the Philippines to admit non-ASEAN rice on more favorable terms.

Raul Q. Montemayor, national manager of the Federation of Free Farmers, said that the Indian concession does not a guarantee access to Indian rice.

""(Import decisions) depend on the price (and) quality,"" Mr. Montemayor said in a Viber message.

""In the past, our importers had not purchased rice from India despite significantly lower prices, most probably due to concerns about quality and reliability of supply,"" he added.

Agriculture Senior Undersecretary Domingo F. Panganiban said in a statement in August that the Philippines had appealed to the Indian government to continue allowing rice shipments to the Philippines on humanitarian grounds.

Agriculture Undersecretary Leocadio S. Sebastian told reporters on Monday that Philippine rice imports could drop to 3.1 million MT amid higher global rice prices.

The US Department of Agriculture expects the Philippines to be the world's top rice importer this year, with shipments of about 3.8 million MT.

Mr. Montemayor said Philippine demand for imported rice is between 2.5 million and 3 million MT, describing any volumes from India as ""not that significant, even assuming we import (the entire quota),"" he added. -- Adrian H.

While there will be a continuation of the earlier policy, there are only two changes likely this time - there will be no deadline, and organic export will not be exempted from restriction, sources said.

Businessline was first to report in August about a possible export restriction on sugar during 2023-24 season.

In a notification issued on October 28, 2022, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade said that the restriction on sugar exports -- mandatory for exporters to have a prior permit from the Food Ministry - would be in place until further orders or October 31, 2023, whichever was earlier.

Exports were restricted from June 1, 2022, to ensure the country had ample stocks for domestic consumption amid fear of a shortage during the festival period and the decision helped curb any rise in retail prices of the commodity. The government initially capped shipments at 10 million tonnes (mt) for the 2021-22 season (October-September), but later allowed additional shipments of 1.2 mt. For the 2022-23 season, permits were issued for export of 6.2 mt.

""Though it is not a ban, it is the same meaning if permits are not issued for export. However, an early announcement will help mills plan how much sugarcane to be diverted to make sugar and how much for ethanol,"" an industry expert said.

Sugar mills in Maharashtra are expected to start sugarcane crushing around Dussehra, and in Uttar Pradesh from the last week of this month.

The Centre had earlier expected 5-5.5 mt of sugar diversion towards ethanol against 4.1 mt last season due to a higher blending target of 15 per cent fixed for 2023-24, against 12 per cent in 2022-23. However, considering the crop situation in Maharashtra and Karnataka, the diversion may not be that high, sources said.

Actual sugar is not diverted to produce ethanol. Molasses or sugarcane juice/syrup or grains are used to make ethanol. The estimate is based on how much quantity of sugar could have been produced from the same quantity of sugarcane that gets diverted towards ethanol.

Though the Indian Sugar Mills Association had, on August 2, estimated sugar production for the current season to drop to 31.68 mt (after diversion towards ethanol) from 32.8 mt in the 2022-23 season, it decided to review the forecast after the monsoon rainfall in August was recorded at the lowest level since 1901. The sugarcane commissioners have informed the sugar output to be 29.5-30 mt.

Sugar mills can currently apply for an export quota under the restricted category, but moving to the prohibited category would mean a complete export ban.

""Sugar output is expected to fall to 30 million tonnes (mt) in the 2023-24 sugar season against domestic consumption of 27.5-28 mt due to El Nino compromising monsoon rain in August,"" one of the officials said.

The El Nino weather pattern made August the driest in more than a century. The rainfall during the month was 161.7 mm, the lowest since 1901.

India, which surpassed Brazil in the 2021-22 season to become the world's largest sugar producer and second-largest exporter, imposed export controls in October last year, adopting a mill-wise quota system. By the end of the 2022-23 crop year, local sugar mills exported 6.2 mt of sugar.

On 2 June, Mint reported that the food and public distribution department may not give sugar mills a free hand in exporting sugar to ensure domestic supply and keep prices in check.

Subsequently, on 29 August, Mint reported that the government will review its sugar export policy, which is currently under the restricted category, in October after state cane commissioners come up with their crop estimate for the 2023-24 season.

In the 2022-23 season, India is estimated to have produced 32.7-32.8 mt of sugar after the diversion of 4.3 mt of the commodity for ethanol production, closing the season with 5.5-6 mt in stocks.

The low rainfall in August, especially in the sugar-growing areas, resulted in a drought-like condition and the government announced that it will ban sugar exports for the first time in seven years. Major producing states like Maharashtra reported a 14% drop (lowest in four years) in production.

World over, sugar experts were watching the Indian monsoon and Cyclone Biparjoy. As it was destroying Kharif sowing, speculators around the world were hedging on sugar prices. That India may ban sugar exports only added to their fortunes, as sugar prices had already jumped 30% from last year.

To understand the global market better, let's look at another major producer - Brazil. The United States Department of Agriculture recently predicted a 6.5% increase in production due to favourable weather and higher sugar prices, but it is uncertain how much actual sugar will reach the international market as Brazil diverts its surplus sugar for bio-fuel and ethanol. Brazil's commitment to the Global Biofuel Alliance started at the G20 in New Delhi also signals that Brazil is not leaving her bio-fuel industry on the simmer any time soon. Especially as Brazil's sugar and bio-fuel industry are deeply tied to the US. Brazil is the second-largest recipient of the US sugar tariff-rate quota with an allocation for ""FY 2023 TRQ of 196,440 metric tons, raw value"".

Apart from its usual international customers, Brazil also exported its raw sugar to Russia, Iran and other African countries. The Indian sugar export ban creates a big opportunity for Brazil to keep her farmers happy. Keep in mind, Thailand has also had bad year and there will be additional demand for Brazilian sugar from many Indian buyers too, if the prices are not checked. With limited supply, the sugar market may very well be a sellers' and commodity traders' dream scenario.

Indian sugar ban

Before the public panic over sugar began, policymakers were quick to ban the export of the sugar because the Indian government cannot afford further food price inflation. Branching off to understand the government's knee-jerk policy, let us see the tomato crisis. The remedy measures for stabilising the tomato, onion and vegetable fiasco already shed a bad light on agrarian policy and state efficiency. Loss of forex is an additional burden. The result was that prices stabilised after a few months, but with the new harvest of tomatoes, prices have crashed for farmers again. Reportedly farmers are once again only receiving under Rs 4-5/kg for their tomatoes.

I dare say, if such flip-flop happens with sugarcane farmers and the industry, it will be a disaster. Hence the government after the export ban also put additional measures. This time all stocking limits have to be declared by retailers, traders, big processors, whole sellers, etc. and all stock quantities have to reported to the government portal on a weekly basis every Monday. The government says that these steps are taken to ""combat hoarding and curb unscrupulous speculation"" in the sugar market.

Now this also presents two other problems - one electoral and the second agrarian cum international. We will begin with the latter. India led the Global Biofuel Alliance from the front. Whenever this Alliance becomes an incarnated entity, it would require India to have a healthy bio-fuel industry too. Without sufficient and cheap supply of raw material or sugar, it would be very hard to encourage the bio-fuel industry in India.

If the government continues to oscillate between good and bad years on sugar policy, no serious players would be interested in investing in the market. What I mean by that is - imagine India has a mid-sized sugarcane based ethanol industry built upon raw material clusters in the country. Now like 2023, if again because of one or two bad rains the sugarcane production diminishes and the government bans sugarcane for ethanol? In all likelihood, whether BJP or Congress, they will follow the electorate logic and divert sugarcane for sugar before ethanol production. This will put the fate of the biofuel industry, like with the case of the sugar industry, in the hands of political masters. Sugar in India is also a very political crop, involving co-operatives, politicians, mills, industry and the government. And no new-age venture capitalist or fund will place money on a project contingent on political whims, especially when the production can dwindle any time.

Without stabilised sugarcane production, biofuel is an expensive and impractical dream. The current situation has exhibited this quite well.

Now comes the electoral problem. The Indian consumers may get to the boiling point, because sugar is critical for the Indian thali. And more pressure to rob the thali of sugar may be perceived by electorate (including farmers) as a direct attack. And speaking of farmers, due to the hyper inflation - rising fuel to vegetables costs, dampened production and bad weather, rural India will demand higher MGNREGA rates and MSP. For sugarcane, the state sugarcane prices would have to be increased to please voters in these politically active regions adding to the sugar price rise.

From the look of it, the government and people appear to be in a sugary mess. The government needs to tread very carefully if it wants to avoid a sugar crisis.",https://thewire.in/agriculture/india-is-in-a-sugary-mess,1,,eng-8928475,"{'uri': 'thewire.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Wire', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 228523, 'alexaGlobalRank': 8294, 'alexaCountryRank': 854}}",,,TRUE

Prices for the crop, a staple for half the world, surged to the highest in almost 15 years after the top shipper began curbing exports. India accounted for nearly 40 percent of the global rice trade in the past three years. Soaring prices are fueling concerns about food insecurity for billions of people in Asia and Africa who depend on the grain.

""Rice, especially in Africa, can certainly bring potential conflict or social unrest, which at this moment in time would be quite dangerous,"" Alvaro Lario, who leads the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said in a Thursday interview in New York.

The export ban is bringing back memories of 2008, when a global rice crisis put 100 million people at risk, many in sub-Saharan Africa. Back then, both Vietnam and India restricted exports. Food shortages have also contributed to unrest in the past, with surging wheat prices helping spark the Arab Spring that toppled governments just over a decade ago.

The impacts of bans ""go beyond the borders of the countries"" implementing such measures, Lario said. Rice is the ""main concern"" for food security -- even more so than wheat, he said.

""Export bans have a lot of impact, especially on the most vulnerable, by raising prices and having a shock on prices,"" he said. ""Generally they are not positive, neither for the local populations in the medium term, nor for the other countries.""

Some regions in Africa that are more reliant on rice imports are already seeing impacts from higher prices, Lario said.

""We have to understand that many of these people who consume this type of crop are sometimes on the brink of poverty,"" he said.

Corn supply boom

A global sugar crunch that drove prices of the sweetener to an 11-year high is finally poised to ease -- and it's thanks to a crop that might seem totally unrelated.

Corn output from agricultural powerhouse Brazil is surging, making it more profitable to use the grain to produce ethanol -- a key fuel that powers cars in Latin America's biggest economy. As a result, mills that crush costlier cane are looking to produce more sugar and less biofuel.

""Anyone with money today is either investing in corn ethanol, or adding capacity to produce sugar,"" said Eder Vieito, senior commodity analyst at Green Pool Commodity Specialists.

Falling sugar prices would be a welcome respite for consumers battling rampant food inflation. A gauge of agricultural commodity prices posted its biggest gain in 16 months in July, before retreating somewhat in August. Extreme weather has damaged sugarcane in India, the world's second-largest producer after Brazil.

Corn is taking a bigger share of the ethanol market in Brazil, which trails only the US among global producers of the biofuel. Ethanol from corn will account for nearly a fifth of all output of the fuel this season, from nearly zero five years ago. By 2033, its share could climb to as much as a third of total supply, consultancy Datagro predicts.

""Biofuel expansion will predominantly come from corn,"" said Renato Pretti, strategic planning officer at ethanol producer Cerradinho Bioenergia SA. The company, which uses both corn and sugarcane as raw material for fuel, is one of a growing number of mills diverting more cane to produce sugar and even investing in new sugar machinery.

Rising corn output in Brazil is allowing for bigger profits from ethanol as sales of byproducts like animal feed mostly cover the cost of the grain. Cane mills, in contrast, recently saw shrinking margins from producing ethanol. The cost of making ethanol from corn was 16 percent lower versus producing the biofuel from sugarcane over the past two years, analysts at bank BTG Pactual said in a report.",https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/24/india-rice-export-ban-is-fueling-risk-of-social-unrest-un-says/,1,,eng-8926048,"{'uri': 'businessmirror.com.ph', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BusinessMirror', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 368527, 'alexaGlobalRank': 86578, 'alexaCountryRank': 574}}",,,TRUE
