Snow may mix in high elevations over Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The withdrawal line of the Southwest Monsoon has progressed into the entire Northeast Indi and the remainder of Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, as of Tuesday, October 17, per IMD. To the south, a cyclonic circulation (CC) lies over the southeast Arabian Sea just off the Lakshadweep coast, and another CC over the southeast Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, fairly widespread to widespread rain with thunderstorms are likely over the Andaman-Nicobar Islands, Kerala-Mahe and Lakshadweep for the next 5 days. Light to moderate rainfall and thunderstorms are expected in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on October 18. Furthermore, a new low-pressure area (LPA) is anticipated to take shape in the southeast Arabian Sea, linked to the previous cyclonic circulation by Wednesday. Another LPA is expected to emerge over the southeast Bay of Bengal by Friday. The former LPA may intensify and become a well-marked low-pressure area over eastcentral Arabian Sea and further into a depression by Saturday, moving in a west-northwest direction away from the Indian mainland. However, the GFS model that it might steer north or northeastward, potentially nearing the Gujarat coast mid-week. As for the latter LPA, significant development is unlikely, although both the ECMWF and GFS models suggest it could approach the Odisha coast in the middle of the following week. It is important to note that confidence levels in these scenarios remain relatively low. Maximum temperatures are forecast to be well lower-than-normal in Northwest India for the next 5 days, while higher-than-normal in the rest of the country, with no heat wave conditions. Overnight minimums should continue to be higher-than-normal across the country.

The investigation into the 25 August 2022 accident, which occurred between Yass and Goulburn is being undertaken by the NSW Office of Transport Safety Investigations (OTSI), which investigates rail accidents in NSW under a collaboration agreement with the ATSB. The report details that 2 SCT Logistics locomotives, crewed by a driver and driver's assistant, were hauling containerised freight train 4MB9 that was en route to Queensland when the fatality occurred. The driver was found on the footplate on the exterior of the train and had suffered a fatal injury after leaving the cabin to check on equipment during an in-line fuelling operation. This interim report details factual information established in the investigation's evidence collection phase and has been prepared to provide an update to the rail industry and the public, said OTSI acting CEO and Chief Investigator Jim Modrouvanos. As such it does not contain any analysis or findings, which will be detailed in the final report on the investigation. Mr Modrouvanos explained that as the investigation progresses investigators will continue to review the rollingstock operator's management of the in-line fuelling system and whether any permanent lineside structures contributed to the driver's injury. The investigation will also consider enterprise training for the in-line fuelling system. The interim report notes that the train operator has taken proactive safety actions since the accident including issuing an updated instruction for in-line refuelling, as well as an updated procedure prohibiting crew from exiting the locomotive cabin while the train is in motion. A final report will be released at the conclusion of the investigation, however, if at any time during the course of the investigation we identify a critical safety issue, relevant stakeholders will be immediately notified so that appropriate safety actions can be taken.

Low pressure areas (LPAs) are linked to the convergence and upward motion of air, forming closed, anti-clockwise wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. And these systems can bring a ton of rainfall across the country when they cross the coasts. Amid the northeast monsoon's impeded arrival due to the southwest monsoon's reluctance to leave, a pair of rain-bearing systems are brewing on either side of South Peninsular India, threatening wet weather to those parts of the sub-continent. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic circulation lying over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea is likely to move west-northwestwards. During this period, it is expected to influence the formation of a low pressure area in the central parts of the Bay by Friday, October 20. In the meantime, another cyclonic circulation that has been stationed over the southeast Arabian Sea since Monday has now given way to the formation of a low pressure area in the region. Weather models indicate that this system will trudge west-northwestwards, developing into a well-marked low pressure area over the next 24 hours and then a depression over the Central Arabian Sea around Saturday, October 21. Its potential strength remains ambiguous for now, but should it further intensify, this system will become the first post-monsoon cyclone in the Arabian Sea this year. It will then be named 'Tej' in accordance with the naming list followed for cyclones in the Indian Ocean region. Accordingly, the IMD has predicted up to moderate showers accompanied by thunderstorms and lighting in Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Wednesday, October 18. Some scattered to fairly widespread rains might permeate South Interior Karnataka as well. Thunderstorm activity is expected to prevail over Kerala until October 19 while light to moderate rains are likely in Tamil Nadu until October 23. Given these predictions, a yellow watch has been issued across Kerala and Tamil Nadu for today so as to urge locals to 'be updated' about the inclement weather. Fisherfolk along the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts have been cautioned against venturing into sea today and tomorrow. Rough sea conditions are likely between October 20 and 22. Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted that the northeast monsoon will arrive in Tamil Nadu between October 23-25, meaning the southern state could witness an almost continuous supply of rains in the coming days.

An amber severe weather warning has been put in place for parts of the UK, with the most severe conditions hitting east Scotland, where a 36 hour warning will remain in place from 6am on Thursday to 6pm on Friday. Parts of Scotland expected to see up to 150-200mm of rain fall. As a result of the miserable weather, LNER rail services will not run anywhere north of Edinburgh on Thursday and Friday due to the severe weather forecast.

A fallen tree blocked the railway between Macclesfield and Stafford, causing all lines to be blocked, resulting in CrossCountry trains running through the area being cancelled or diverted. Transport for Wales stepped in to help commuters travelling between Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly, while a shuttle bus service replaced trains for those travelling to the area. Meanwhile in Maida Vale, West London a huge tree came crashing down onto a car, while the driver was trapped inside it. Fire crews raced to the scene and managed to miraculously grab the driver out of the crushed vehicle. Gale force winds are expected along the coast of Wales and South West England, as well as in higher areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. The storm will first bring some heavy rain to Northern Ireland through this afternoon and into Thursday morning. The Met Office said people in the region can expect spray and flooding which may lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures for the duration of the yellow warning for rain, which comes into effect at 2pm and expires at 10am on Thursday. It said 'there is a small chance' that homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings. It also warned of a a small chance of fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and communities being cut off by flooded roads. If flooding occurs, there is a chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wardle said: 'Storm Babet will bring disruption for parts of the UK in the coming days, with heavy rain and strong winds likely for many. 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'As well as heavy rain, Storm Babet will bring some very strong winds and large waves near some eastern coasts too. Gusts around 70mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. Met Office warnings will continue to be reviewed as the forecast develops.' The RNLI warned the strong winds that have been forecast along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. RNLI water safety partner Sam Hughes said: 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' The Met Office said low pressure is forecast to remain in charge of the UK's weather into the start of next week, with potential for further spells of wet and windy weather.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12643649/Travel-chaos-CrossCountry-cancels-trains-Exeter-Plymouth-LNER-stops-services-north-Edinburgh-Britain-braces-Storm-Babet.html,-1

Among the container carriers affected are Singapore-headquartered X-Press Feeders. One of its VSA partners' vessel has been forced to abandon ports untimely and before it had concluded its operations to load containers. A ship was given 24 hours for 1228 moves at Chittagong Port which according to the carriers is impossible at the Bangladesh port. Another vessel of X-Press Feeder had to leave the port and wait at anchorage over 48 hours for the required waiver certificate which caused supply chain disruptions. The unstructured and inconsistent way in the issuance of waiver certificates makes it very difficult for feeder operators like us to ensure smooth vessel operations and uphold sailing frequencies to serve the trade, says X-Press Feeders' COO Francis Goh in a comment. We are monitoring the situation closely and urge the relevant authorities and trade associations in Bangladesh to do the right thing in the interests of international trade. Another of the Singapore-based feeder lines' ships had an export waiver granted and then revoked shortly thereafter without any logical reason. All in all, X-Press Feeders has had five vessels involved and faced disruptions so far. Straits Orient Lines (SOL) has apparently also experienced disruptions in the Bangladeshi port. The issuer of the waiver is Mercantile Marine Department. Sabbir Mahmood, Principal Officer at the MMD, explains to The Financial Express that the problem has deepened due to fall in the volume of export cargoes. We need to apply the flag-protection rules seriously when such situation arises, he says. No Bangladesh National Shipping Line is mentioned in the article. However, as HR Lines presents itself on its web site as Bangladesh's only container shipping line, foreign competitors believe the strict application of the rules will only favor HR Lines thereby causing unfair competition.",https://shippingwatch.com/regulation/article16519223.ece,-1

Train expert explains after Colorado derailment,"Meanwhile, Colorado and BNSF debate responsibility for the collapsed bridge DENVER (KDVR) -- Federal investigators have released preliminary information showing a broken rail likely caused the Colorado train derailment near Pueblo on Sunday. That derailment killed a truck driver on Interstate 25 and has led to an indefinite closure of the interstate. The National Transportation Safety Board released its preliminary findings on Tuesday. Train derailment investigator Gary Wolf told FOX31 that broken rails are a common because of derailments. The rails are made of high-quality steel, but occasionally, there can be an imperfection in the rail, Wolf said. These can develop quickly or sometimes they develop slowly, and when they do, they start cracking out the railroad. And eventually, it results in the rail breaking part, and obviously, you lose continuity in the rail surface and the wheels go down and hit the ground. Wolf said railway companies use special equipment to test for broken rails multiple times each year, but he said defects can be tough to find. It is very difficult to find these defects in a rail, he said. It is the proverbial needle in a haystack that you are looking for. When you are going down the track with this ultrasonic test car, you are looking for defects in the millimeter range, and they are tough to find. Who is responsible for maintaining the bridge? Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. According to spokesperson Matt Inzeo, CDOT is aware of the statements BNSF has been making regarding ownership, saying the agency is working through every document we can find that deals with rules, responsibilities and ownership. One reason this is taking time is that we continue to encounter and need to resolve potentially conflicting information. Inzeo added: While there are a handful of exceptions, the state does not own the railroad bridges that cross state roads. For all bridges owned by other entities, they have their own inspection and maintenance responsibilities as part of using that bridge for its given purpose (railroads and utilities are the most common cases of this). And for the few railroad bridges that the state does own, railroads also conduct their own inspections. We do not have records of BNSF's inspections of this bridge.",https://kdvr.com/news/colorado/what-causes-broken-rails-train-expert-explains-after-colorado-derailment/,-1

As part of its strategy, Ryanair, whose low fares have helped it dominate markets in Ireland, Italy and much of western Europe, aims to beef up its presence at eastern European airports. It already operates from more than a dozen Polish airports, including nine bases, CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters, often negotiating special deals to secure lower fees - crucial in the contest to keep costs down, and fares too. Whenever we come up against Wizz, we tend to have significantly lower fares and have much lower costs, he said. As an example of the strategy, he cited Albania, where Ryanair plans to open 25 new routes this winter to take on Wizz in its eastern European heartland. But Hungary-based Wizz is not standing still. It plans to operate at least twice as many planes as it currently has in central and eastern Europe by 2038 and is shortly set to announce 35 new aircraft in Poland alone, Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters. We are looking at double-digit growth year-on-year, over the next seven or eight years in the region, Varadi said. POLISH PROMISE With nearly 40 million people, Poland is by far emerging Europe's biggest country, where rising disposable incomes have fuelled a demand for travel that makes the region an attractive prospect as western European markets mature. All these people are getting richer. And when you get richer, you fly more, especially if you start from a base of not flying very much, said Jamie Lindsay, an investor at Artemis Investment Management LLP, whose funds own Ryanair shares. According to data analysis firm IBA, low-cost carriers have over 59 of the aviation market in Poland, up from 31 in 2021. That figure is expected to continue growing as more Poles travel for tourism and work rather than migration, said Michal Kaczmarzyk, the CEO of Buzz, Ryanair's low-cost charter and budget subsidiary based in Warsaw. He added that Buzz and Ryanair were mainly focused on regional airports, like Modlin outside Warsaw or Katowice near Krakow. That contrasts with Wizz, which mostly flies from Warsaw's main Chopin airport and, according to Kaczmarzyk, means no one could replace Ryanair's offer in Poland. Ryanair's Polish push comes as the Irish-based company faces headwinds in Italy, where it is the largest airline in the market, and France, as regulators seek to impose minimum ticket prices to curb short-haul flights - whether due to environmental reasons or to protect bus and train companies. Poland and eastern Europe's lighter regulatory requirements, lower environmental scrutiny and poor rail connections make them appealing markets by comparison. Regional airports play a vital role in passenger traffic in Poland, with the top 10 Polish regional airports having almost 50 of the market share and noting a strong post-pandemic recovery, said Dan Taylor, head of consulting at IBA Insight. MORE PLANES For both Ryanair and Wizz, new planes are also driving their expansion, with Ryanair set to put a sizable chunk of a 300 plane order announced earlier this year in Poland and neighbouring countries, Kaczmarzyk said. Today we have 64 planes in the region, he said. We assume that in 10 years we will at least double the fleet. If today in the region here we have about 30 million passengers, we assume that there will be 60 million. O'Leary also said around 180 of the 400 new aircraft the company plans to deploy over the next eight years would operate in central and eastern Europe. Varadi, meanwhile, is just as confident in prospects for Polish and neighbouring markets, and in the ability of budget carriers like Wizz to take share from national airlines such as Poland's LOT or Romania's TAROM. He noted that the war in Ukraine on Poland's border had not dented travel. At the end of the day ... so long as economies are growing, GDP is up, that creates more disposable income for the consumer and airlines continue to benefit, he said. This is what we are seeing and what we will continue to see.

The 20,000km of railway that criss-cross South Africa once symbolised the nation's mining might, carrying trains loaded with coal and iron ore destined for India, China and other markets under the state's Transnet freight monopoly. But the volume of cargo carried by Africa's biggest rail network has collapsed by a third in the past five years, in a crisis described by President Cyril Ramaphosa as of catastrophic proportions and highlighting the dysfunction at the heart of some of the country's most critical state-owned companies. In a mirror of the disarray at the Eskom power monopoly, officials and business leaders are working to turn around the management turmoil and alleged corruption that has left Transnet beset by train line vandalism, cable theft and blockages at ports. The crisis has throttled crucial commodity exports in the continent's leading industrial nation, threatened thousands of mining jobs and hit badly needed tax revenues. One symbol of the dysfunction, according to people familiar with the network, are so-called ghost or unscheduled trains that operate without proper tracking of revenue. Transnet has said it is investigating the claims. In an effort to tackle a threat to the economy rivalled only by Eskom's rolling blackouts, Ramaphosa this week announced that his government was finalising a plan to enable greater public and private investment in Transnet, which is burdened with R130bn (6.9bn) of debt. The reforms, which still need cabinet approval, would not privatise the rail operator altogether but shift the state's role to owning and managing infrastructure. We have been clear that South Africa's port, rail and electricity infrastructure are strategic national assets and will remain in public ownership, Ramaphosa said at a meeting of the ruling African National Congress. Transnet was also seeking government support for a short-term turnaround plan, its board said last week. The monopoly's chief executive Portia Derby and its head of freight rail -- the biggest division in an empire that also spans ports and pipelines -- have both resigned in the past month. The ANC's union allies joined business calls for their departure after miners warned of job losses because of missed export opportunities. Transnet's board was replaced in July, and its chief financial officer has also quit. Lower mining taxes and royalties caused in part by the Transnet crisis have contributed to an increase in South Africa's budget deficit to nearly 6 per cent of GDP in the past 12 months, ahead of initial projections. Transnet's growing losses and debt are further risks for Ramaphosa's government, which is already juggling higher borrowing costs and bailouts for Eskom. We are losing a billion rand a day because of where we are. The fact that Transnet lost over R5bn in the last financial year is absolutely nothing compared to what our treasury has lost in terms of revenue, said Jan Havenga, professor in logistics at Stellenbosch university. Ahead of national elections likely to be held next April or May, balancing plans for private investment with government ownership of infrastructure will test the ideological bedrock of the ANC, which has long favoured state companies such as Transnet and Eskom. At the same time, Transnet's crisis has exasperated the mining industry, including some of South Africa's biggest black-owned businesses. Exports via one key coal rail line last year dropped to their lowest since 1993, and analysts estimate the route could deliver only 50mn tonnes this year, far below its 90mn tonne capacity. Companies say they are missing opportunities, such as last year's rush by European power operators to replace Russian coal following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Exports to Asia are also under threat. It is all well and good for me to say that Japan needs my coal, China needs my coal, India needs my coal, said Mike Teke, chief executive of coal miner Seriti Resources. I need to be able to know if I mine the coal . . . a train will pick it up tomorrow and take it to the port. Coal miner Exxaro has forecast it will export less than half of its 10mn tonne capacity during its 2023 financial year, and said it was also being hit through a stake in iron ore operations that depend on a separate Transnet line. That is a huge loss of opportunity for us, said Exxaro chief executive Nombasa Tsengwa. There was scope for more private sector involvement on critical lines, she added. Transnet's outgoing management blamed a lack of locomotives for the decline in its service, particularly since the collapse of a Chinese supply deal that was marred by corruption under Jacob Zuma, the former president. But this was not the full story, Havenga said. It is the turnaround time of the locomotives that is the problem. We do not sweat them enough. The ability to run trains properly had been lost, he added. Miners say efficiency gains and other basic measures, such as satellite tracking to halt the ghost trains, are vital alongside long-term plans for private sector involvement. However, Transnet's recent experience suggests marrying private capital to South Africa's failing state monopolies was easier said than done. Last year the company offered several trial slots for private companies to operate trains on two container corridors. Of 19 interested bidders, only two submitted proposals and just one received a slot. Many investors were put off by slots being available only on short-term contracts despite requiring rolling stock investments that might take decades to pay off. Mesela Nhlapo, chief executive of the African Rail Industry Association, a business group, said any planned reforms would need a strong regulator to ensure Transnet negotiated future private access in good faith. South Africa has more than 150 years of experience with the railways . . . we should be leading and integrating the continent, she said. We have not stepped up.",https://www.ft.com/content/db3889e3-738f-401b-ba68-107d4e448576,-1

Manchester Township's zoning board reversed course on several parcels near the historic Prospect Hill Cemetery on the basis that previous decisions handed down by the body were erroneous spot zoning. The decision came Tuesday night after hours of discussion and debate -- and a previous hearing earlier in October. Spot zoning, according to Cornell Law School, refers to instances where the zoning laws applied of one parcel differs from the standards that apply to other nearby properties. The parcels, rezoned from residential use to industrial use in 2021, were challenged by Prospect Hill Cemetery owner Matt Seyler who argued that the rezoning was considered spot zoning. Seyler sued Manchester Township and the Manchester Township Board of Supervisors to challenge the rezoning of two land parcels near the cemetery. One belonged to former cemetery owner Jack Sommer and the other to Met-Ed, and Sommer sold his 52-acre parcel to Inch  Co. after the rezoning was completed in 2021. At issue were two ordinances, passed in 2021 and 2023, for rezoned parcels at 180 Willis Run Road, 700 N. George St., 1201 Pennsylvania Ave. and Willis Road.  Please consider subscribing to support local journalism. Seyler purchased the cemetery -- which borders Manchester Township, North York and York City -- from its previous owner, Sommer, in 2022. At the time of the sale, Seyler said, he knew that 52 acres of the property had been subdivided from the larger cemetery and sold to Inch  Co. in 2021. However, he said he did not know the township had rezoned that 52-acre parcel for industrial use just before the sale to Inch  Co. When a real estate advertisement on the website LoopNet included a mock-up of a potential warehouse at the Inch  Co.-owned property, nearby residents began to push back.

The French translator was prepared for the worst from the storm. And thankfully for her and hundreds of others like her, so was the airport. Kansai Airports, operator of the airport, revised its business continuity plan for natural disasters and strengthened shore protection and facilities to prevent a repeat of the catastrophe that developed in September 2018 during Typhoon No. 21. Up to 8,000 people were trapped inside the off-shore inundated airport after a tanker ship crashed into a connection bridge. We will never forget what we learned from Typhoon No. 21, said Yoshiyuki Yamaya, CEO of Kansai Airports. Being always prepared is extremely important. RELIEF SUPPLIES After touring the Kansai region and Tokyo, Stephan, 38, and her family arrived at Kansai Airport on the night of August 14, looking to leave Japan on August 15. They arrived a day early because of the risk of the connection bridge being closed by Typhoon No. 7. Around 650 people stayed overnight at the airport that day. Kansai Airport had ample relief supplies on hand, such as food, drinkable water and baby goods. Sleeping bags, batteries and foodstuffs prepared especially for Muslims were newly added to the supply list. The airport also increased its estimated number of stranded passengers in disasters from 8,000 to 12,000. Stephan received bedrolls and water for her family from airport staff. I was nervous because we were here with our child, she said. We did not bring something to cover our bodies, so the sleeping bags were helpful. I appreciate Japanese-style hospitality. A burger restaurant, a convenience store and other shops were kept open for the passengers. Under Kansai Airport's business continuity plan amended four years earlier, the normal airport environment should continue for 24 hours after the onset of a disaster. The revised plan specifies 18 categories in which airport functions could be lost in a disaster and provides countermeasures and recovery processes. During Typhoon No. 7, information display panels in four languages continued showing reports on the weather, traffic accessibility and distributed supplies. Five years ago, a power outrage in Typhoon No. 21 shut down the airport's public address system, depriving non-Japanese passengers of their means to obtain information. An additional 70 emergency multilingual speakers have been installed at the airport, as well as a system in which foreign travelers can fill in cards to inform airport staff of which language they use and what special care they may need. ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT At the airport, Stephan struggled to contact her airline. She received a notice that her flight would be delayed by a week, and she tried to discuss the problem in person. However, the airline's counter at Kansai Airport was closed. Stephan turned to the internet but was not content with the airline's response. She canceled the flight and flew to France with another carrier. Stephan and her family ended up staying three nights at Kansai Airport. While I have no complaints about the airport, a sign displaying airlines' contact details would have been beneficial in case of an emergency, she said. Many foreigners have never experienced earthquakes or typhoons, so they may panic over the lack of understandable information. Stephan, who can speak Japanese, was flooded with messages from friends who returned ahead of her. One said, I would be unable to handle it on my own since I use neither Japanese nor English. INFORMATION CHAOS Typhoon No. 21 five years ago inundated the airport's airstrips and terminals, shutting down operations. Damage to the connection bridge from the ship took seven months to repair. Numerous parties are involved in an airport's operations, including carriers, customs and quarantine offices, fire departments and public transportation firms. Information sharing was slow and complicated, bringing about problems to various organizations, a Kansai Airports representative said about the 2018 disaster. This is what we regretted very much five years ago. For its new comprehensive emergency headquarters, Kansai Airports incorporated a framework for 32 entities in and outside the airport. They are expected to gather during disasters to monitor developments, consider steps together and exchange opinions. Previously, they held separate talks with each during emergencies. The new system, with Kansai Airports playing a central role, has contributed to much faster decision-making. Six meetings took place at the comprehensive emergency headquarters on August 14 and 15 during Typhoon No. 7. Participants quickly decided to restrict passenger aircraft landings on August 15 to prepare for a possible closure of the connection bridge. The cooperation through the headquarters helped us make a proper decision to reduce confusion, a Kansai Airports representative said. The operator has also increased the height of its shore protection barriers by 1.5 meters to 2.7 meters on the north, south and east sides. Around 40,000 wave-dissipating blocks were also installed on the southern and eastern sides of the airport, while a levee to guard against tsunami in the south is 1.5 meters higher than its predecessor. A power source for the airport has been relocated aboveground. Kansai Airport's monthly passenger number reached 2 million in July for the first time since February 2020 when the COVID-19 crisis began. The airport expects a surge in tourists with the 2025 Osaka Kansai Expo.",https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15010958,-1

The company cited extended downtime at the plant as well as conveyor belt failures for the latest production cut. According to the company, the output from the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) is expected to range between 9.3 million tonnes and 9.8 million tonnes. This is significantly down from the production forecast of between 10 million tonnes and 11 million tonnes announced in July this year. It must be noted that IOC's production dipped by 14 over the previous year to total 2.4 million tonnes in third quarter.

Rossendale's James Killelea and Co was closed on Friday, with a former employee saying staff turned up to work on October 13 and could not get in the building. James Killelea and Co, based in Stoneholme Road, Crawshawbooth, has been in business since 1970 providing structural engineering services including 3D building design, structural steel fabrication and erection. In a financial statement for the year ending May 2022, the firm recorded a turnover of 11.4m, which was a decrease of 50 per cent from 2021. The company also generated a pre-tax loss of 772,000 for the year to May 2022. Recently, the firm has worked on projects including Bury College, Tarleton College, apartment blocks in Manchester and industrial units in Liverpool, Knowsley and Rotherham. It has also worked on the 20m Luton Airport car park, which made headlines last week after it caught fire. Posting on LinkedIn earlier this week, several employees had been advertising the fact they were now seeking new roles following news that the company had folded. One person said: Very sad news to hear of major established north west steel company James Killelea going into administration. Another added: Really sad news to share today as James Killelea  Co Ltd file for administration. And one user offered an olive branch to staff left without a job, saying: Having heard the sad news of James Killelea  Co Ltd I would like to offer their workforce the opportunity to join us Elland Steel in Halifax. We currently have several vacancies for all areas of the business. It is believed administrators Leonard Curtis Recovery Limited are dealing with the administration process. Leonard Curtis has been contacted for comment. A spokesperson for James Killelea and Co, which is believed to have employed around 92 staff, said: It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of James Killelea  Co. Ltd. The Company had enjoyed 53 years of uninterrupted trading to become a major supplier throughout the UK of numerous steel framed structures for a wide range of sectors such as, stadia, commercial, retail, transport, industrial and warehousing. We have been privileged to assist in the building of the infrastructure of our country and this could only have been possible with the talent and dedication of our loyal staff, many of whom we had drawn from our local community. None of what we have achieved would have been possible without them. However, the business whilst operating within a highly competitive industry has been severely financially affected by the impact of Covid, fluctuating markets, escalating material prices and rising energy costs. The current downturn in the construction industry has resulted in this unfortunate situation and despite the best efforts of the directors to rectify matters administration was the only option. It is with a heavy heart and great regret that this decision was taken, and we take this opportunity to thank all our staff, past and present for the commitment they have shown whilst in our employment and we wish them the very best for their future. Rossendale Council leader, Councillor Alyson Barnes has also been contacted for comment. The steel fabrication firm was founded in 1970 by James Killelea and his son Robert. Robert, aged 79, served as the firm's managing director, and his brother Patrick, 68, joined the family business some time later as the financial director, and Ellen Killelea worked as the company secretary. The news comes less than a week after staff at Studio Retail were told there could be job losses at its base in Accrington, with the announcement made by email on Thursday, October 12. Staff said they had been told of plans to relocate the business to Derbyshire, nearly 100 miles away, making it nigh on impossible for them to keep their jobs unless they uproot their lives and move to the East Midlands. In February of 2022, the company had to call in administrators after a 25 million funding bid failed. The company was then purchased by Frasers Group for 26.8 million. After buying out Hyndburn's Studio Retail Ltd last year, Frasers purchased the 76k sqft office property in Clayton-le-Moors which was used for Studio Retail's administrative and operational functions. The office sits alongside the flagship warehouse in Church, which was also acquired by Frasers as part of the initial agreement. There had been rumours last year of the offices being shut and moved to Trafford in Manchester, but this never materialised.",https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/23862047.rossendales-james-killelea-co-calls-administrators/,-1

Ever since Pierre Trudeau made the fateful decision to build Mirabel Airport on expropriated farmland 55 kilometres north of downtown ahead of the 1976 Olympics, air travellers to and from Canada's second-biggest city have experienced this country's worst airport hell. And that is saying a lot. For two decades after the Olympics, the cavernous and often empty Mirabel Airport handled international flights while the much older and cramped Dorval Airport on the Island of Montreal retained domestic and cross-border ones. The arrangement irritated travellers to no end. Foreign airlines began bypassing Montreal altogether. By 1996, Lufthansa, Alitalia, Varig and TAP had all said adieu to Montreal. That is when the Aroports de Montral - the independent authority set up four years earlier by Ottawa to manage both of Montreal's airports - decided to cut its losses and consolidate all scheduled flights at Dorval, which was renamed in honour of Mr. Trudeau in 2004. The move was widely supported by business leaders. But it was also short-sighted, leading directly to the current congestion at Trudeau airport that has Montrealers dreading air travel. The problems predate the pandemic. But the surge in air travel this year - Trudeau airport handled 14.3 million passengers in the eight months to August 31, compared with 13.9 million in the same period in 2019 - has made the situation much worse. For several weeks this summer, massive traffic jams into and out of Trudeau airport saw countless travellers with luggage exit taxis in the middle of the highway and make their way to the main terminal on foot to avoid missing their flights. The arrivals and departures decks at Montreal-Trudeau cannot accommodate existing traffic levels - and congestion is expected to get much worse for several years when construction aimed at fixing the problem gets under way in 2024. Not that the proposed fix will offer much relief for long. That is because Trudeau airport is landlocked, surrounded by residential neighbourhoods, with little or no space to grow. The main terminal is more than 60 years old, and despite the addition of a new wing for international flights more than a decade ago, it is dinky compared with the airy and modern (though expensive) airport terminals in Toronto, Ottawa or Calgary. Lines to the customs hall often snake back to arrival gates during afternoon rush hours. For its part, Porter Airlines is hedging its bets by building a new terminal at the tiny St-Hubert airport south of Montreal, at which it hopes to replicate the success of downtown Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport as a more convenient alternative to the busy Pearson airport. In a new book, HEC Montral professor Jacques Roy argues that the 3-billion ADM has invested in Trudeau airport since 1997 would have been better spent on upgrading highways and building a rail link to Mirabel. We would have an airport without space constraints, open 24 hours a day and without environmental nuisances for residents, Prof. Roy writes in La saga des aroports de Mirabel et Dorval. The book projects that Trudeau airport's existing runways will reach capacity as soon as 2043, or a full quarter-century before the 2068 date ADM estimated in 2018. ADM spokesperson Eric Forest insisted in an e-mail response that Trudeau airport's two runways have enough remaining capacity for several more years. He noted that London's Heathrow Airport, with a similar runway configuration, handled twice as many aircraft movements as Trudeau airport did in 2019. What is more, Mr. Forest added, the number of movements at Trudeau declined 16.6 per cent in the first eight months of this year, even though passenger traffic rose, because some airlines used larger planes. Still, Prof. Roy argues in his book that there are limits to comparisons with Heathrow. The London airport specializes in international flights with an average of 170 passengers per flight in 2019, compared with an 85-passenger commercial flight average at Trudeau airport. Domestic and cross-border flights (on which smaller planes are used) account for more than half of all Trudeau's traffic. And the era of ever-larger planes has ended. Unfortunately, going back on that decision to consolidate all flights at Trudeau airport would break the bank. The main terminal at Mirabel was demolished in 2014 and building a new one would cost several times the estimated 500-million Ottawa spent to build the entire airport in the early 1970s. What is more, the money ADM has sunk into Trudeau airport since 1997 has already left it with gross debt of almost 2.9-billion - with more to come. In a report in May, Moody's Investor Services projected that ADM's capital expenditures and debt financing will increase substantially in late 2024 as it undertakes construction work to improve access to Trudeau airport and complete a Rseau express mtropolitain (REM) light-rail transit station to link the airport to downtown by 2027. The REM's arrival could help ease congestion if more passengers opt for public transit over taxis or their own cars. But that remains a big if. Chances are most REM traffic will consist of existing transit users. Via Rail's proposed High Frequency Rail project might displace some air traffic in the busy Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor, easing congestion at Trudeau. But that project is years away from breaking ground, if it ever does. In short, Montreal's airport curse will not be removed any time soon.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-montreals-decades-long-airport-curse-is-about-to-get-much-worse/,-1

Israel's army and Hamas blamed each other for the attack. Oil market watchers, meanwhile, began worrying about an increased possibility of oil supply disruption from the region as the prospect of a diplomatic solution became rather remote. The latest indication for this was the cancelation of a summit between YOU.S. President Joe Biden and the presidents of Egypt and Palestine, to be held in Jordan. Jordan canceled the summit on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Jordanian King Abdullah has blamed the tragedy at the Gaza hospital on Israel. With Saudi Arabia also taking a pro-Palestine stance in its recent conversations with the YOU.S., the possibility for a quick end of the fighting is fading away while the possibility of greater regional involvement appears to be rising if oil prices are any indication. A long occupation looms as the scenario that pushes Brent oil futures above US100bbl because it raises the risk that the Israel-Hamas conflict expands and potentially draws in Iran directly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar told Reuters. Clearly a widening of the conflict would bring more supply risks to a market which is already very tight, Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for Dutch ING, told Bloomberg. The most immediate supply risk likely remains around Iranian barrels. Bloomberg recalled Iran had earlier this week warned that the escalation of the conflict regionally was getting inevitable. Meanwhile, the latest GDP data from China provided additional support for prices.

The Governor said this on Tuesday when he paid a visit to the railway terminus in Maiduguri, the state capital. In a statement by his media aide, Isa Gusau, Zulum noted that the state government was not informed until residents intercepted the movement of the coaches. He added that all legal means will be followed to ensure that infrastructures meant for the state are not moved to any other place. According to him, about five months ago some of the rolling stocks were conveyed to other states of the federation without the knowledge of the security operatives and the Borno State Government. This time around the community raised alarm when they saw the movement of these rolling stocks from Maiduguri to other parts of the country. When we contacted the management of Nigerian Railway Corporation, they said the rolling stocks would be moved to Jos for a complete overhaul and be dispatched elsewhere, he added. Zulum argued that, The decision to relocate the rail infrastructures was crudely pursued by Nigerian Railway Corporation.

Camilla Theakstone, 28, alleges staff at the world-famous club did nothing to help her and did not take her claims seriously, even after she raised concerns with management in a July email outlining at least a dozen specific instances of inappropriate behaviour by other guests. The former journalist has now filed a formal complaint against Bondi Icebergs with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) alleging multiple breaches of the Sex Discrimination Act. She is seeking 5000 in legal fees plus 15,000 in damages for hurt and humiliation as well as reputational harm resulting from the Club's unlawful treatment of me. I do not care about the money, I have my own, Ms Theakstone told news.com.au. I will give it all to my lawyer. It is just about sending a strong message. She insists that all she wanted was for the club to erect a sign stating that leering, harassment or disrespectful behaviour is not tolerated and would result in an immediate ban -- something she says management initially agreed to but never followed through. All I wanted was a sign, she said. In her lengthy 22-page complaint to the AHRC, which runs to more than 13,600 words, Ms Theakstone accused Bondi Icebergs of wilful negligence to create a safe and lawful environment for women. I have been a paid member of the Bondi Icebergs Club since February 2022 and visit the Club's sauna and pool on an almost daily basis. Since becoming a member of the Club, I have made many friends with other members and attendees and often, I have positive experiences, she wrote. However, over the past two years, a deeply embedded culture of misogyny and sexual entitlement towards women, particularly young women, within the sauna has emerged. I frequently either experience sexual harassment and abuse myself or witness it directed towards other women. Ms Theakstone said on most occasions she ignored behaviour from male guests that made her feel uncomfortable, but in some cases when the unwanted behaviour persisted she reported it to the venue. But she claims it did not appear that staff were trained to deal with such incidents. It is a well-known fact around Bondi Beach that the Icebergs Club sauna is 'very creepy', and women often complain to me they stopped attending because of men's behaviour, she wrote. For example, one woman who also regularly attends the sauna one day said to me, 'That place is so creepy -- I feel so sorry for you, you have such a good body and whenever you enter the sauna, all the men stop talking and just stare at you. It must be horrible.' She alleges that on one occasion while she was in the sauna, a much older man she did not know said to her, Everyone who is here is here because they want a body like yours, while pointing his hand up and down my body while leering at me. It made me feel uncomfortable and objectified, she wrote. All the men in the sauna then started leering at my body following his comment. Ms Theakstone emailed Bondi Icebergs on July 16 outlining alleged incidents of sexual harassment, which she either witnessed or experienced in the sauna almost every time I attend the Club. The alleged experiences include men regularly forcing conversation on me while in the sauna despite my clear efforts to demonstrate I am not interested in talking to them, men trying to force me to give them my number, despite it being clear I am not interested, and men, particularly older men, leering at my body while inside the sauna despite me frowning at them to signal how unwanted and violating their behaviour made me feel. This happens almost daily, she wrote. She described several instances of men intentionally sitting or standing too close to her, opportunistically staring at her breasts and backside, and accidentally rubbing their bodies against her. I have also had a man make an inappropriate comment about my body when I walked in front of him in a packed sauna, apologising for blocking his view, she wrote. He then said, 'No not at all, the views only got better,' and laughed with the man seated next to him. It made me feel uncomfortable. She alleged on one occasion a man in the sauna leered at me while standing next to me while making loud, slow sucking noises with his mouth, which was disturbing to me. Another man deliberately spread his legs exposing his crotch to me while wearing Speedos and asking me if I thought he was 'man-spreading'. It was clear he was being provocative because I did not want to talk to him, she wrote. On another occasion she allegedly witnessed a man leer at and attempt to chat up three teenage girls, causing them to leave the sauna. Ms Theakstone also alleged that a male Bondi Icebergs staff member perved on her while they were both surfing one day. As I duck-dived a wave, the force of the water pushed my bikini bottoms down, exposing my backside, she wrote. I quickly turned around to pull them up and noticed the staff member positioned to my side, slightly behind me. Instead of looking away and respecting the vulnerable position I was in, he stared at my exposed backside opportunistically and smirked to himself, with his eyes widened. After her initial email, Bondi Icebergs requested a meeting to drill down on your allegations but Ms Theakstone declined saying she would prefer written communication. In her AHRC complaint, she said in the email requesting a meeting, she was told it was difficult to investigate her allegations without hard facts such as times, names, dates, places, descriptions, conversations. Given how chronic the sexual harassment was inside the Club's sauna, and the nature of the offences and environment (i.e., it is a public club that is transient in nature -- anyone can attend the sauna for a fee of 9 and I do not know the names of most the men who harass me as they are tourists), it was creating impossible standards for me to reach in order to validate my experiences or consider them true, she wrote. After a lengthy back-and-forth over the following weeks, Ms Theakstone was on August 10 informed she was banned from the club. I have done some preliminary investigations today and discovered several alternate views to the ones you have expressed over a period of time, the club said. There is no doubt that your allegations and the tone of your allegations have put an enormous degree of stress on all those concerned included sic staff but more importantly on yourself. The club said it was deeply concerned ... about its ability to provide the environment you wish for and the fact you continue to put yourself in this alleged environment that causes you so much grief, stress and frustration. The Club went on to say it had made the only decision it could make for Ms Theakstone's health and safety was to remove you from the toxic environment you allege it is. We have temporarily suspended your entry to the pool  membership as at 6pm this evening. Once we find the people you allege have harassed you, they will also be temporarily suspended. We have not taken this decision lightly, but we are deeply concerned for your welfare and this decision keeps your sic free from alleged harassment in the short term. Ms Theakstone wrote, I was shocked to receive that email -- it directly punished me for raising a formal complaint by suspending my membership and banning me from returning. A spokesman for the club told news.com.au in an email on Wednesday he was unable to comment as the matter was before the AHRC. In her complaint, Ms Theakstone identified several of the alleged perpetrators by name and said some of them had previously been banned by the club for inappropriate behaviour. Asked whether any guests had been banned for inappropriate behaviour towards women, the spokesman said, We get between 5000 to 7000 guests to the pool each week, weather permitting. This is the only complaint we have ever received along these lines. But Ms Theakstone told news.com.au that was not true. A spokesman for the AHRC said, The Commission cannot comment on any potential, pending or active complaints brought forward to it.",https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/sydney-woman-alleges-bondi-icebergs-banned-her-for-complaining-about-creepy-men-leering-in-sauna/news-story/8764c73a51365d190726a6d6da51f661,-1

Sunday's endurance event saw traffic gridlock across the city with key roads closed to drivers and traffic channelled onto alternative routes. A mother of two, who asked not to be named, reported it taking her two hours to drive from Summertown to the railway station. READ MORE: Oxford mum fears for son's health amid severe sewage floods And Rebecca Davies, from Oxford, said it took her 90 minutes to drive from Woodstock Road to Littlemore. Another motorist Mary Biclou said her drive from Abingdon to Hinksey Park took over an hour. An engineer from North Oxford added: The knock-on effects hit the A34, so it is now impacting the national road system. I saw an ambulance on blue lights stuck in traffic near Wolvercote roundabout with no way of getting through the traffic. But the county council has said diversions were publicised well in advance of the road closures with road signs visible to motorists in the days leading up to the event. It was a record-breaking half marathon in Oxford with around 13,000 runners making it the biggest event yet. Runners coming down Banbury Road during the half marathon (Image: Ed Nix) One person attending the event, who did not wish to be named, argued the county council could have given the race a miss this year. He pointed out that the city is already being hit with the closure of Botley Road. The road closure was extended over the Christmas period by Network Rail after the key route had initially been scheduled to temporarily reopen for four months. Sunday's gridlock saw an ambulance on blue light stuck in traffic, as well as buses being diverted through Jericho and blocking the narrow streets. In response, a county council spokesman said: The Oxford Half Marathon is a popular annual event which attracts thousands of runners and raises large sums of money for charity. It takes place on a Sunday morning to minimise disruption. Diversions were publicised in advance and were marked via the Oxford ring road. Traffic in the city centre (Image: Contributed) Exemptions to closures were included for emergency services, event participants, support and safety vehicles and for emergency works to services in the roads. Residential access and deliveries were managed by marshals. Broad Street and sections of Parks Road and Museum Road were closed from Saturday before the race day for the installation of the start and finish areas. Organisers Limelight Sports Club said all roads, except for Broad Street, Radcliffe Square and Parks Road - between Holywell Street and South Parks road - would be re-opened by 2.30pm on Sunday.",https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23861143.oxford-motorists-outraged-council-justifies-marathon/,-1

Read our privacy notice Those of us who depend on trains to travel around Britain are not having the best of decades. The government's decision to tear up plans for the most critical parts of HS2 will be seen for many years to come as an act of criminal damage to the nation's infrastructure - and the latest blow to confidence in a Victorian network required to try to deliver a 21st-century experience. For significant parts of 2020 and 2021, rail was off-limits except for essential workers. Frontline staff kept the network running. Billions of pounds were spent running largely empty trains. Once the pandemic was over, those workers wanted a no-strings pay settlement that took account of their contribution during Covid. Ministers insisted that the finances of the rail industry had emerged in such poor shape (one estimate is that revenue is down 40 per second) that even a modest pay rise was contingent on radical reforms to working arrangements. The deepest, longest and most bitter industrial dispute in living history has thwarted tens of millions of journeys since strikes began 16 months ago. Both the main rail union, the RMT, and the train drivers' union, Aslef, remain far apart from the train operators - whose hands are tied by the government. Yet, as winter infiltrates our lives once more, there are a couple of reasons to be cheerful. The first is that we will go at least four weeks without a national rail strike - which I hope indicates that negotiations, or at least talks about talks, are underway. The most recent stoppage was the train drivers' walkout on Wednesday 4 October, timed to coincide with the end of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester. With, as I write, no further action notified by Aslef or the RMT, the first possible date for another strike is Thursday 2 November. Get those trips in now, fellow travellers - and make the most of the dwindling daylight to enjoy the best of the UK's rail journeys. To help, I have calculated the train operators with the most scenic networks. The three highest-placed English operators share third place: CrossCountry, Northern and TransPennine Express. CrossCountry wins because it has the very best of the southwest and the northeast. It shares with GWR the amazing stretch of the South Devon coastline from Teignmouth to Dawlish (and, I contend, the Exe estuary into Exeter). But it can also claim the marvels of the East Coast Main Line, shared with LNER, from Durham as far as Aberdeen. Coast, cities and spectacular civil engineering, over the Tyne, the Firth of Forth and the Tay en route to the granite city. The Northern network links many of the loveliest parts of highland England, as well as some fine coastal stretches - Lancaster to Barrow, curving around Morecambe Bay, is highly recommended. The train operator would rate highly for the Settle-Carlisle line alone. TransPennine Express carves through Cumbria, too, as well as the Scottish stretch of the West Coast Main Line. It also runs on the main line from Manchester to Leeds across the Pennines, and much of the East Coast main line north from Durham. Second place is occupied by Transport for Wales. Wherever you travel in the nation, as well as the stretches through the English borders, you will be blessed with some combination of coast, countryside and industrial archaeology. Only ScotRail can do better, thanks to its repertoire of rail glory threading through landscapes matched in majesty by the infrastructure created by Victorian engineers. Stranraer to Glasgow to Fort William to Mallaig is world-class, as are the lines running north, east, south and west from Inverness. The two top train operators also enjoy the benefits of having settled their disputes with the rail unions. Make the most of the marvels.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/rail-best-scenic-train-networks-uk-b2431264.html,-1

Nevertheless, minimal damages are expected to the vessel and crew in case of an attack'. The measures undertaken by the Philippine Government in Zamboanga, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, with the conduct of continuous military operations and dismantling the support base of the ASG in Sulu archipelago, ensures the likelihood of the end of the group through surrender, arrest, and neutralization. In an exclusive interview with SAFETY4SEA, ReCAAP ISC Executive Director, Krishnaswamy Natarajan, had explained that piracy and armed robbery incidents are invariably transnational maritime crimes, which require collaborative, cooperative, and coordinated efforts of all stakeholders both on land and sea within the nation and neighbouring countries. ReCAAP ISC advisory Moreover, ReCAAP ISC has updated its Advisory to all ships to exercise vigilance and adopt necessary preventive measures while transiting the area. The ships are to maintain communication with the authorities and report all incidents to the Operation Centres of the Philippines and ESSCOM as indicated in the following contact details: Troubled history of the area ReCAAP ISC had been extremely concerned with the large-scale increase in incidents of abduction of crew for ransom situation in the Sulu-Celebes Seas and waters off Eastern Sabah since March 2016. On 21 Nov 2016, the Centre published an Incident Alert titled Increasing Cases of Abduction of Crew for Ransom from Ships, advising ships to re-route from the area, where possible. The ship masters and crew are otherwise urged to exercise extra vigilance while transiting the area and report immediately to the Operation Centre of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) of Malaysia. The threat level of abduction of crew was then deemed to be 'HIGH' as the abduction of crew has not waned. Luckily, with the concerted efforts undertaken by the Philippine and Malaysian authorities, no abduction of crew incidents was reported since January 2020; and no crew is presently held in captivity by Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). With the notable improvement in the situation, the ReCAAP ISC in consultation with the PCG downgraded the threat level of the abduction of crew from 'HIGH' to 'POTENTIALLY HIGH' in May 2022. In September of the same year, the PCG in consultation with relevant government agencies, and regional partners have come up with a risk-assessment pertaining to the prevailing situation in the Sulu-Celebes seas, which eventually manifested in further downgrading of the threat level of the abduction of crew from 'POTENTIALLY HIGH' to 'MODERATE' which implies that 'Incidents are possible to occur, but are relatively less severe in nature.' On 15 September 2022, the ReCAAP ISC updated its advisory to all ships to consider re-route from the area as an option based on its prerogative.",https://safety4sea.com/threat-level-in-the-sulu-celebes-seas-downgraded-to-moderate-low/,-1

The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Last month, White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said that YOU.S. intelligence had been tracking the possibility of North Korea supplying Russia with weapons for quite some time. And the reason why...there is such an intense effort on the part of Moscow to generate this kind of support from North Korea is that we have continued to squeeze...Russia's defense industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition, Sullivan said in September. Other researchers have also documented evidence pointing to increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia following Kim's visit to Russia. The level of rail traffic is far greater than what has been observed at the facility during the past five years, even compared to pre-Covid-19 levels, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report released earlier this month. Given that Kim and Putin discussed some military exchanges and cooperation at their recent summit, the dramatic increase in rail traffic likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.

As part of its strategy, Ryanair, whose low fares have helped it dominate markets in Ireland, Italy and much of western Europe, aims to beef up its presence at eastern European airports. It already operates from more than a dozen Polish airports, including nine bases, CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters, often negotiating special deals to secure lower fees - crucial in the contest to keep costs down, and fares too. Whenever we come up against Wizz, we tend to have significantly lower fares and have much lower costs, he said. As an example of the strategy, he cited Albania, where Ryanair plans to open 25 new routes this winter to take on Wizz in its eastern European heartland. But Hungary-based Wizz is not standing still. It plans to operate at least twice as many planes as it currently has in central and eastern Europe by 2038 and is shortly set to announce 35 new aircraft in Poland alone, Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters. We are looking at double-digit growth year-on-year, over the next seven or eight years in the region, Varadi said. POLISH PROMISE With nearly 40 million people, Poland is by far emerging Europe's biggest country, where rising disposable incomes have fuelled a demand for travel that makes the region an attractive prospect as western European markets mature. All these people are getting richer. And when you get richer, you fly more, especially if you start from a base of not flying very much, said Jamie Lindsay, an investor at Artemis Investment Management LLP, whose funds own Ryanair shares. According to data analysis firm IBA, low-cost carriers have over 59 of the aviation market in Poland, up from 31 in 2021. That figure is expected to continue growing as more Poles travel for tourism and work rather than migration, said Michal Kaczmarzyk, the CEO of Buzz, Ryanair's low-cost charter and budget subsidiary based in Warsaw. He added that Buzz and Ryanair were mainly focused on regional airports, like Modlin outside Warsaw or Katowice near Krakow. That contrasts with Wizz, which mostly flies from Warsaw's main Chopin airport and, according to Kaczmarzyk, means no one could replace Ryanair's offer in Poland. Ryanair's Polish push comes as the Irish-based company faces headwinds in Italy, where it is the largest airline in the market, and France, as regulators seek to impose minimum ticket prices to curb short-haul flights - whether due to environmental reasons or to protect bus and train companies. Poland and eastern Europe's lighter regulatory requirements, lower environmental scrutiny and poor rail connections make them appealing markets by comparison. Regional airports play a vital role in passenger traffic in Poland, with the top 10 Polish regional airports having almost 50 of the market share and noting a strong post-pandemic recovery, said Dan Taylor, head of consulting at IBA Insight. MORE PLANES For both Ryanair and Wizz, new planes are also driving their expansion, with Ryanair set to put a sizable chunk of a 300 plane order announced earlier this year in Poland and neighbouring countries, Kaczmarzyk said. Today we have 64 planes in the region, he said. We assume that in 10 years we will at least double the fleet. If today in the region here we have about 30 million passengers, we assume that there will be 60 million. O'Leary also said around 180 of the 400 new aircraft the company plans to deploy over the next eight years would operate in central and eastern Europe. Varadi, meanwhile, is just as confident in prospects for Polish and neighbouring markets, and in the ability of budget carriers like Wizz to take share from national airlines such as Poland's LOT or Romania's TAROM. He noted that the war in Ukraine on Poland's border had not dented travel. At the end of the day ... so long as economies are growing, GDP is up, that creates more disposable income for the consumer and airlines continue to benefit, he said. This is what we are seeing and what we will continue to see.

Les Neiges is Le Havre's dockers' district. At the end of each side street stands a 3-metre, steel-and-concrete fence topped with razor wire; beyond that, dipping and swivelling, the cranes and gantries that process more than 3m containers a year. Hidden away in those shipping containers, stashed among the bananas, frozen prawns, cane sugar and canned fruit, is an ever-increasing quantity of cocaine. Of the record 27 tonnes of the drug seized in France last year, more than a third was intercepted in the Normandy port. What we are actually seeing, said Laurent Laniel of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), is a concerted, ongoing attempt to flood Europe with cocaine. It is an expanding market, and it shows no sign of slowing. Each year since 2017, Laniel said, EU police and customs officers have seized more of the drug than the last. In 2021, the most recent year for which full data is available, it was 303 tonnes - five times more than a decade ago. And that is just what we intercepted, he said. Right now, it does not seem like a battle we are winning. The consequences, within and beyond the continent's key north-western gateways of Antwerp, Rotterdam and Le Havre, are spiralling corruption as the drug cartels bid to co-opt port logistics firms, local union officials and politicians, even the judicial system - and a dramatic increase in violent crime. As South American traffickers link up with European organised crime gangs to share the spoils of a 10bn market, the Netherlands, Belgium and France have witnessed drug-related contract killings, torture, bombings, shootouts and deaths. Credible plans have been uncovered to kidnap senior government ministers. In Les Neiges, unsurprisingly, it is not something people much want to talk about.

You do not seriously expect to find anyone round here who will be happy to tell you about that? With reason. Last year, a few hundred metres from here, police opened fire on a group of men unloading cellophane-wrapped bricks of cocaine from a container. In another incident reminiscent of Mexico or Colombia, heavily armed criminals stormed a high-security warehouse to liberate their stash. This February, six local men, all of whom grew up in or operated out of Les Neiges - including Louis Bellahcne, alias Doudou or the King of the Port - were handed prison sentences totalling more than 100 years for helping to smuggle 1.3 tonnes of South American cocaine out of the terminal. Unable to resist the temptation - as one said at his trial - of earning a year's salary in a couple of hours, dozens of Le Havre's 2,200 dockers, as well as port agents, truck drivers and other port workers, have been arrested over the past five years. For those who hesitate, the cocaine cartels have other, more forceful methods. More than 30 port workers have been kidnapped or held hostage since 2017. In 2020, one - a 40-year-old union leader and father of four - was beaten to death and dumped behind a local school; two years earlier, another was found alive but horribly tortured, his calves repeatedly stabbed with a screwdriver. Some give way to the coercion. Guys will come up to them at the school gates, or in a cafe, and show them smartphone photos of their wife and kids, says Valrie Giard, a lawyer who has defended several. They say: do what we say, or they get it. Many, though, need little encouragement: according to a list of tariffs found by police, the going rate for helping to extract a container from the port is 75,000. Moving it out of CCTV range or closer to a fence will earn you 50,000, while a loan of your security badge is worth 10,000. Recruiters can earn 100,000 per operation. The sums are tiny compared with the drug gangs' staggering profits: a kilo of cocaine bought for 1,000 in Colombia is worth more than 35,000 in Europe and, once smuggled out of port and cut - or diluted with other substances - can be sold on the street (or, more likely, ordered by WhatsApp or Signal) for 50 to 70 a gram. Cultivation of coca leaves in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru has been rising since 2014, according to a report this year by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, and surged by 35 from 2020 to 2021. Meanwhile, global cocaine manufacture has surpassed 2,000 tonnes, double the 2014 figure. The drug is also 40 purer now than in 2010. In Europe the drug sells at up to twice the price in the US, where the market is now saturated. With an estimated 3.5 million Europeans using cocaine in 2021, four times more than 20 years ago, Europol puts the total street-level value of the European cocaine market at somewhere between 7.6bn and 10.5bn. With those kinds of sums involved, the logistics chain has become very efficient, Laniel said. It uses mostly containers, but also yachts, fishing boats, private jets, now manned semi-submersibles or submarine drones. And once it gets here, there is a veritable European army to distribute it - we estimate at least 100,000 people. The business is largely controlled by Mexican mafia gangs, police say, who once served as middlemen for the Colombian Cali and Medelln cartels but are now in command of much of the chain, from financing production to organising the smuggling into Europe. Shipments are separated to reduce cost and risk, and sold to pan-European crime syndicates including the Moroccan Mocro maffia active in Belgium and the Netherlands, Serb, Albanian and Kosovan gangs, and Calabria's 'Ndrangheta. The main entry point remains Antwerp, about 450km north-west of Le Havre, where police and customs officials - who, as in most ports, have the resources to check only between 1 and 2 of all containers - intercepted more than 43 tonnes of cocaine in the first half of this year alone, after 110 tonnes in 2022. The tsunami, said the Belgian port's customs chief, Kristian Vanderwaeren, just keeps coming. Brussels' chief public prosecutor, Johan Delmulle, this year warned that with molotov cocktails, car bombings and gun battles regularly rocking the streets of Antwerp, the country could soon come to be seen as a narco state. Antwerp has witnessed more than 200 drug-related violent incidents over the last five years, including 81 last year alone. In January, an 11-year-old girl - the niece of two of Belgium's top accused drug smugglers, the El Ballouti brothers - died after five bullets from a Kalashnikov assault rifle were fired into the family kitchen. A retired Belgian police officer, who asked not to be named because he still advises government agencies, said the hidden share of the drug business in Antwerp, Europe's second busiest port, was just huge. About 100km further up the coast, in the world's largest port of Rotterdam, a reinforced customs operation - including the full automisation of the port's cargo terminals - has made things significantly more difficult for the smugglers and helped reduce seizures from 70 to 47 tonnes last year, according to a senior customs official, Ger Scheringa. But drug-related violence has reached unimagined heights in the Netherlands. In July 2021, the investigative TV journalist Peter R de Vries was gunned down in a car park in Amsterdam and died nine days later. A crime specialist, one of his sources was the key state witness against alleged drug baron Ridouan Taghi, arrested in Dubai in 2019. A lawyer involved in the same case, Derk Wiersum, was also shot dead in 2019, prompting - along with incidents such as the discovery of a shipping container transformed into a torture chamber - the mayors of Amsterdam and Rotterdam to warn of a culture of crime and violence ... taking on Italian traits. Everywhere, police and customs investigations are being heavily ramped up. Le Havre brought in 25 new officers this year, while Antwerp has a new drug commissioner and aims to ensure all containers coming from South America are automatically scanned within the next five years. Police have made breakthroughs: in 2021, Sky ECC, a messaging service seen as uncrackable by its users, was broken, leading to thousands of new drug cases. But the overall impact on Europe's ballooning cocaine trade was minimal. You take one out, another just replaces him, said a French investigator. Increasingly, too, the traffickers are spreading their bets. As seizures in Rotterdam have shrunk, those in nearby Vlissingen have doubled. Smaller, less well-guarded ports are being targeted: fishing harbours in Spain and Portugal, minor Swedish ports. Last year, for the first time, 600kg of cocaine was seized in Montoir-de-Bretagne, a small roll-on, roll-off dock in the Loire estuary. Equally alarmingly, instead of making cocaine in South America and shipping the finished product to Europe, the gangs are also setting up sophisticated factories on the continent to extract cocaine paste hidden in maritime cargos ranging from plastic polymers to asphalt products, and then transform it into powder, Laniel said. More than 30 such labs were dismantled on the continent in 2021, according to the EMCDDA. In May, a police raid on a remote cottage in Galicia, north-west Spain, allegedly found eight cooks working around the clock. Once fully operational, the new production line could have turned out 200kg of cocaine a day, Spanish police said. Cocaine kills people slowly, Laniel said. It also brings with it unprecedented violence, and corruption. A lot of bad people are making huge amounts of money. It is being taken seriously now. But it is a massive challenge.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/18/tsunami-keeps-coming-europe-growing-cocaine-market,-1

Around 5:30 p.m. EST, police said they were told the man driving the SUV had driven around a crossing guard at a CSX railroad crossing. The train pushed the SUV for a quarter of a mile before finally coming to rest. Police said three people were inside the SUV and only one had minor injuries. The collision caused rocks to fly from the rail bed and hit at least three parked trucks, smashing various windows. I guess it is where the car was in the gravel as the train was pushing it and it just threw the rocks over here on my street, said Columbus Roberts, whose neighbors' vehicles were among those damaged. Another neighbor told WKRC that she frequently sees people driving around the crossing guard in an attempt to beat the train. A review of Federal records shows there is only been one collision at the Seymour Avenue crossing. That was in 1977 when the railroad was operated by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. Nothing has ever happened like this, said Roberts. I am shocked that it happened here so quick and nobody got hurt. I am amazed nobody got hurt out of that. WKRC has reached out to CSX for comment.

He added that the informal transport service will be carried out normally like other international airports without any change and there was no ban on the transport of passengers in Siem Reap Airport and that Siem Reap Angkor International Airport has decided to transfer the rights of a company to operate transportation services in the airport, which costs  35 per car and  40 per bus or  8 per person. His Excellency continued that the establishment of this service is because Siem Reap Angkor International Airport is a new airport and about 50 km from Siem Reap and there is no public transport to get there, so the airport decided to operate a taxi service. He added that if you look at the transportation cost of the bus,  8 per person for a distance of nearly 50 km compared to other transport services in kilometers, the two transport services are no different As for the cost of transportation, he added that it depends on the choice of the traveler His Excellency further stated that for other transporters outside the system who want to enter the system of Siem Reap Angkor International Airport, they can register with the Transport Association to maintain order and safety for passengers at the airport. He also added that other unregistered passengers can also be transported as well as in other airports without entry restrictions. However, the stated that if you need to park, you have to pay the parking fee.

According to the Estonian ministry of economy, the damage site was located about 30 miles off Hiiumaa, an island in the Baltic off the west coast of Estonia. The cable is Swedish-owned, and the operator brought it back into service within a matter of days. The description matches the Sweden-Estonia EE-S1 cable, which terminates on Hiiumaa. The break was only partial, Sweden's Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said Tuesday, and an investigation into the because is under way. We cannot assess what caused the damage. But what we can say is that this damage has happened at a similar time and in physical proximity . . . to the damage that was previously reported to a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland, and a telecommunications cable between Estonia and Finland, he said. The Balticconnector pipeline and an adjacent telecom cable were damaged in the early hours of October 8. The government of Finland said last week that it has because to believe that the rupture was caused by external forces. While the culprit has not been identified, Finnish authorities believe that it was an actor with a high degree of technical sophistication. A sabotage of this caliber requires a certain amount of know-how and special equipment. It is probably not ordinary people who were behind this, said Timo Kilpelinen, head of the Finnish NBI's Investigation Department. According to the BBC, Finnish sources have quietly indicated that they believe that the pipeline rupture was an act of retribution carried out by Russia.

It rained so hard that it washed away many of our crops. Then the temperature rose suddenly, causing pest attacks, he said. I have never seen this kind of weather. Floriculture and cultivation of vegetables such as red cabbage and iceberg lettuce have flourished in Sekuri  surrounded by a protected forest area in Himachal Pradeshs Chail  for decades because of an ambient climate.Floating in tears: Indian farmers sing of loss from cruel climate crisis But climate change has hit the Himalayan range hard, disrupting the lives of over a billion people in South Asia living in the mountains as well those in plains dependent on river basins originating in glaciers. Indias June-September monsoon, which brings 70 per cent of the countrys rainfall, ended at a five-year low of 94 per cent of a long period average this season. But more worrying than the drop in volumes has been its erratic pattern. After a sluggish start in June, rains rebounded above average in July, followed by one of the driest months in history in August. Unusually heavy showers in September wiped out a seasonal deficit, but hit the ripening crops close to harvest. The intense burst of rain also caused landslides, flash floods and houses to collapse. In northeastern India, a glacial lake overflowed and burst through a dam this month. Forty people died and thousands were forced to flee their homes. More than 100 people have been killed in Himachal Pradesh alone this year during the rainy season. Scientists estimate that such erratic weather means South Asia could lose between 10 and 50 per cent of crop production by the end of the century due to global warming. Farmers in Sekuri said a canopy of trees surrounding their lush village probably saved them from the brunt of disasters, but climate change is inevitably disrupting their age-old sustainable living.Shattered by weather fluctuations Even in the peak of summer, the temperature would never rise above 25 degrees Celsius in our village. But this year, it rose to 35-40 degrees, said Vipin Kumar, another farmer. The weathers impact has been so intense that even plants kept inside protective greenhouses have not been able to escape its fury. Pointing to some Chinese cabbages planted in rows, Kumar showed how the vegetables leaves had opened out instead of remaining packed together. We will have to throw these away. Nobody will pay anything, he said, gesturing as well to another lot riddled by pests. Soaring costs of fertilisers and seed packets had further cut into his meagre income, he said. Neighbouring farmer Baldev showed how the unseasonal weather had resulted in mottled green patches of a viral disease on some of his crop of yellow zucchinis. We normally get at least 100 boxes of vegetables from the summer season, but this year, we barely got 30, he said.Why a delay to South Asias monsoon is bad news for global rice supplies Similarly, half of farmer Naresh Thakurs tomato crop was washed away by the rain. Three years ago, Thakur took on a job at a nearby hotel to support his fluctuating income, but he rued that the extreme weather disrupted even the tourist inflow as landslides choked off an arterial highway throughout the peak summer season. The highway has only been partially cleared of rocks and boulders from the landslide, impeding the movement of farm goods, for which speedy deliveries are essential to ensure their freshness. We cut the flowers when they have half-bloomed because otherwise they start to wilt and droop by the time they reach wholesale markets in Delhi and Chandigarh state capital of Punjab state. They last no more than three days, said Rajnish Thakur, whose family pioneered floriculture in the area. Farmers cultivate carnations, chrysanthemums and other flower varieties inside greenhouses or in open fields. Timeliness is important because market prices can fluctuate as much as 1 rupee to 15 rupees for every stalk of flowers, depending on their availability during peak demand periods for festivals and weddings. Rajnish Thakur said many of the flower buds prematurely dropped this season due to the temperature fluctuation. Most farmers in the village say they have not earned anything from the summer crop and are living on their savings. The vulnerability of their produce has also increased as greenhouse gas emissions have enhanced the airs capacity to hold water, causing sudden bursts of heavy rainfall, scientists say. El Nio weather  which caused warming of the Pacific Ocean  exacerbated the impact this year. Himalayan blunder The Himalayan range is one of the most vulnerable on Earth  as it is mostly a young mountain range and it is growing. What is happening with global warming is that we have even higher Himalayan warming because the topography is steep, said Dr Farooq Alam, an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, who has been conducting research on glaciers in Himachal Pradesh for 15 years. Even the Paris Agreement that agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius pre-industrial levels would result in a 2-2.1 degree rise in temperature in the Himalayas, he added. Global warming is being felt more profoundly in the Himalayas Indus basin  comprising almost the whole of Pakistan and the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Kashmir region (divided between India and Pakistan)  because around 40 per cent of the water in the river basin is dependent on glacier melt, he said. Monsoon rains, which contribute to the river system, are also affected by climate change, he added. The effects are being compounded by construction of infrastructure such as roads and dams, resulting in cutting down of trees. Alam said many of these underdeveloped provinces needed infrastructure for greater market access, but the impact of their development had to be carefully assessed by scientists before construction. Farmers blamed their crop woes on the environmental destruction, with cliff sides being shorn of vegetation to make way for better road access. The problem is that trees are being cut and reforestation efforts are mostly a scam. Nobody bothers to nurture saplings beyond one year, Kumar said. We prefer our simple way of living to taking up jobs. But these days we are barely able to meet the expenses because of fickle weather.",https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3238207/himalayan-farmers-paying-price-climate-change-ive-never-seen-kind-weather,-1

The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately - ATACMS proved themselves, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the YOU.S. administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Zelenskiy's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 190 miles (310 km). The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a YOU.S. Army website says. A NEW CHAPTER Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a new chapter of the war had begun. There are no more safe places for Russian troops within the ... internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, he wrote on X. Russian military bloggers commented on the attacks during the day, with Telegram channel Fighterbomber saying Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS. Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS for the first time on Tuesday. Since starting a counteroffensive in June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in Russian-occupied areas, but it has failed to liberate significant territory from Russian occupation. Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern group of forces, told national television that there had been no letup in Russia's week-old assault on the devastated town of Avdiivka in the east, with Ukrainian forces repelling 10 attacks. Shtupun also said Ukrainian forces advancing southward to the Sea of Azov had registered partial success west of Verbove, one of a cluster of villages it is trying to capture. The Ukrainian military said Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter.

The news comes as Biden prepares to depart for visits to Tel Aviv, where he will underline US support for Israel. Meanwhile, Israel continues to ramp up preparations for an anticipated ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in response to the deadly October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas militants, Ukraine continues to fight off a Russian assault which has now been going on for over 600 days, and China continues to threaten Taiwan. US senate leaders had said earlier on Tuesday they expected Biden to send them a request by the end of this week for billions of dollars in assistance for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and for security at the US border. Two of the sources said the request was for a full year of funding, explaining its large size. A congressional source familiar with the request told Reuters that Israel had asked for 10 billion in addition to the 3.8bn per year it received from the United States under a 10-year agreement that began in 2016.

The stark figures speak for themselves. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam has resulted in a staggering loss and damage, said Christophoros Politis, the United Nation Development Programme's deputy resident representative in Ukraine. The preliminary figures put the damage and losses at 13.79 billion, taking into account the environmental toll, the loss of power generation, irrigation for farming and housing as well as other factors. The destruction of the dam is foreseen to have severe, enduring consequences on Ukraine's environment, economy and society, a post-disaster needs assessment report said. The UN added that it does not know the extent of damage to Russian-occupied areas of the Kherson region, where the dam was located. Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, which crosses the Dnipro river, flooding the surrounding area with landmine-contaminated water and leaving areas upstream without water supply.

President Joe Biden approved a future delivery last month and told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House that the US would give Ukraine the ATACMs, without specifying when or how many would be delivered. Because of lingering US concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, for instance by striking targets on Russian soil with NATO weaponry, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range of and carry cluster munitions, which when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets, rather than a single warhead. Kyiv has also put pressure on Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, similar to ATACMS, causing debate amongst German politicians. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had used the risk of escalation to justify his decision not to deliver Taurus cruise missiles with a range of 500 kilometres to the war zone for the time being, despite urgent pleas from Ukraine.

Measures to improve the energy efficiency of the entire grid are also planned, according to a KfW statement. For example, the reconstruction of the grid infrastructure will include the use of reinforced concrete to protect the facilities against further attacks, as well as energy-efficient technologies. Ukraine's power grid has been severely damaged by targeted Russian airstrikes since the start of the war. According to the KfW, by April 30 Ukraine's energy production capacity was less than half what it had been before the war. In addition, 41 out of 94 high-voltage transformers had been damaged or completely destroyed by attacks, according to the report.

It would be paid over a period of four years. The aid package was adopted with 512 votes in favour, 45 against and 63 abstentions. This is a strong sign of our support and solidarity, Michael Gahler, co-rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, said. The adopted draft provides for controls to prevent any embezzlement, any waste and any corruption, Gahler added. Ukraine is to submit a reconstruction plan for the aid package, and the European Commission is to sign off on the distribution of the funds. The MEPs also proposed using confiscated assets of Russian citizens and companies for Ukraine.

The two leaders met Tuesday evening at an event kicking off the forum, video posted by Russia's Foreign Ministry showed, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries. They then took part in a group photo with other leaders attending the summit. Putin also met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in China on Tuesday. Orban has maintained ties with the Kremlin despite widespread condemnation of Russia's ongoing war of aggression on Ukraine. In statements carried on Russian news agencies, Putin claimed that Russia was satisfied that Russia's ties with many European countries are maintained and developed. He said, One of those countries is Hungary. Hungary has opposed many EU initiatives resisting the Russian invasion of Ukraine and supporting Ukraine. The country still receives pipeline gas deliveries from Russia and has a limited exemption to EU sanctions on Russian crude oil deliveries.

In its daily update on the war in Ukraine, the ministry described the offensive as likely the most significant offensive operation undertaken by Russia since at least January 2023. Russia's attack is likely being carried out with multiple armored battalions, which are attempting to envelope the town, the Ministry of Defence statement read. It added that Avdiivka has been on the frontline since 2014. The town is a major obstacle in preventing Russian forces from their wider objective of taking control of Donetsk Oblast. The ministry suggested that Ukrainian forces were so far holding back the Russian advance. It added that Russian forces have sustained heavy equipment and personnel losses. Slow progress and high casualties have likely triggered a change in messaging from Russia, from an offensive to 'active defense,' as successfully clearing Avdiivka looks increasingly unlikely in the short term. Russia has significantly intensified its attacks on Avdiivka in recent days.

On Saturday, a fire broke out in a cargo of eucalyptus paper bales in the forward hold of the wood chip carrier Batavia Express. The Cape Town fire department responded to the scene, and assisted by expert salvors from Smit, they set about extinguishing the blaze and preserving the rest of the cargo. Fire-damaged paper bales were pulled out of the hull, extinguished and landfilled, a fire department spokesperson told local outlet IOL. The undamaged cargo will be transferred to a nearby warehouse for temporary storage. The situation is under control, but the full salvage operation is expected to extend through this Friday. According to specialist outlet Insurance Marine News, it is the second time Batavia Express has had a cargo hold fire in less than a month. In mid-September, while the ship was under way from Santos to Qingdao, a fire broke out in one of the holds. Batavia Express had to divert to the anchorage at Saldanha Bay, north of Cape Town, arriving Sept. 16. A team of 10 local firefighters joined the ship to bring the fire under control, and the vessel was allowed to berth in Cape Town on Sept. 20. It was fully extinguished by Sept. 22. AIS data shows that Batavia Express has remained in Cape Town since the end of the previous fire. At the time of her delivery in 2013, the 70,000 dwt Batavia Express was the largest purpose-built wood chip carrier in the world.

China's economy grew more than expected over the summer, as the government offset some of the harm from a real estate crisis by pouring money into infrastructure construction projects, like building rail lines. Data released on Wednesday showed that gross domestic product grew from July through September compared with the prior three months. Industrial production of everything from chemicals to steel began to stabilize as the government built more roads, sewage lines and other public works. China's economy, the world's second largest, has struggled since the spring, as housing sales slowed and some of the biggest developers faced insolvency. The country's debt load, which has surged in the past 15 years, continues to weigh on growth. In the third quarter -- from July through September -- the economy grew 1.3 percent when compared with the three previous months. In the second quarter, the economy grew 0.8 percent. When projected out for the entire year, the third-quarter data indicates that China's economy was growing at about 5.3 percent, compared with an annual rate of a little over 3 percent in the second quarter. It seems tentative, but better than it was three months ago, said Meg Rithmire, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in the Chinese economy. Consumers, alarmed by the property crisis, have been wary of spending. At the heart of the economy's deeper problems is the real estate market: A two-year decline in home prices has left families feeling less prosperous, and less willing to spend money as a result. Weak demand for goods and services has left the economy teetering at the edge of deflation. Consumer prices were unchanged in September from a year earlier, and wholesale prices charged by producers actually fell, according to government data released on Friday. Falling prices for apartments have triggered a wave of insolvencies among real estate developers and depressed construction -- previously one of the country's largest industries. According to the Beike Research Institute in Tianjin, average prices for existing homes across 100 Chinese cities are now down 16 percent since August 2021. The government has tried to offset the slowdown. Officials in Beijing have given local governments a green light to issue more bonds to pay for infrastructure projects. The state-controlled banking system has been pumping out loans to manufacturers so they can invest in more factories. The goal has been to create jobs, with the hope that people will then spend more money. Unemployment has been high among young people this year. The lending is starting to help companies like Dalian Bingshan Group, a large manufacturer of commercial heating and cooling systems in the city of Dalian. At Bingshan, we get a lot of government support -- financing support, policy support, said Ji Zhijian, the group's chairman. China's top leader, Xi Jinping, has cracked down over the last several years on private sector companies in fields ranging from internet platforms to home tutoring. But he has showed hints of softening in recent days as the economy continues to struggle, remarking on Friday, during a visit to Jiangxi Province, that he wanted to promote the healthy development of the private economy. The pandemic casts a long shadow. The main G.D.P. number reported by the government on Wednesday, which compared this summer to the same period last year, showed growth of 4.9 percent. But a year ago, China's economy was still struggling with zero Covid restrictions that included municipal lockdowns, mass quarantines and severe limits on travel between provinces. It is not fair to compare the economy now to the economy a year ago, when many in China were stuck in their homes, and that comparison also tells you little about where the economy is headed now, said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics, a London research firm that focuses on China. China's factories are still busy. Even as China's growth has slowed, its factories continue to produce a torrent of goods. And with domestic growth slowing, and consumers at home wary of making big purchases, China is finding big markets overseas. China is flooding the world with exported cars, electric ones as well as gasoline-powered models. Much of the merchandise is going to Europe. Before the pandemic, shipping statistics show, China exported 2.7 containers of goods to Europe for each container it imported. In recent months, China has been exporting almost four containers of goods for each container of imports. But China's export surge is generating political heat. European officials are concerned about the trade imbalance. And the European Union has already begun an anti-subsidy investigation into China's fast-growing exports of electric cars, which could lead to tariffs next summer.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/business/china-gdp-q3.html,-1

The BRF will be held from October 17 to 18 in Beijing. (XinhuaJu Huanzong) Since its debut, the BRI has been conceptualized as the Green Belt and Road as China is committed to sustainability, environmental protection, and international environmental standards. BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Over the last decade, large infrastructure projects across the land, water, and even deserts of the globe have been erected under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), remarkably facilitating transportation and economic development. Amid appreciation and applause from the host countries, there are some discordant voices in the West alleging that those projects have posed negative impacts on the environment. No doubt, such opinions were misguided and need to be critically examined. PRESERVING BIO-DIVERSITY RATHER THAN DESTROYING Before 2022, travelers from northern Croatia had to pass through a 9-km stretch of Bosnia and Herzegovina's coast to reach Ston, a small town located at Peljesac, a sun-drenched peninsula in southern Croatia. The construction of the Peljesac bridge, a BRI project, shortened the distance, but also made local oyster farmers worry that it would affect the production of shellfish, which has been inscribed into the European Union (EU) Geographical Indications Register. However, the Chinese companies that built the bridge have always adhered to the highest environmental standards, and the local farmers told me that the production and quality of oysters have not been affected at all, and the bridge has actually boosted their sales, said Qi Qianjin, Chinese ambassador to Croatia. A zebra is seen next to a fence as a freight train runs on the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway track in Kenya, on July 28, 2022. (XinhuaDong Jianghui) Actually, environmental conservation measures, such as water protection and management, noise control, and the construction of bridges to ensure the safe passage of wildlife, have been widely employed in BRI projects. In Kenya, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) runs through some sensitive ecosystems such as national parks. The project has designed several wildlife corridors, including seven bridges, several culverts, and embankments to funnel wildlife to the underpasses to reduce the risk of train-wildlife collision. Noise absorbers are also installed along the wildlife corridors to reduce possible disturbance of the animals. It is one of the most important projects where BRI has made substantial efforts to lower impacts on ecologically vulnerable areas, said Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan international relations scholar. BRINGING DEVELOPMENT WITH CLEAN, GREEN ENERGY In many BRI host countries, traditional dependence on fossil fuels caused air pollution, harmed people's health, and created a dilemma between reducing carbon emissions and economic development. Committed to open, green and clean cooperation towards inclusive and sustainable development, the BRI incorporates many projects designated to promote clean and renewable energy, such as wind farms, solar power plants, and eco-friendly transportation systems. Through BRI projects our government has taken different projects for the reduction of carbon emission and transition to green energy sources in our country, said Dilip Barua, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist). The former Bangladeshi industries minister said China had assisted his country in constructing several solar power plants, such as the Cox's Bazar wind power project, being environmentally friendly energy sources. The recently inaugurated Cox's Bazar wind power project, a flagship initiative invested by Wuling Power Corp. and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp., marked a major milestone in Bangladesh's quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy. The wind power project is located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from the capital Dhaka. Upon operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 metric tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 metric tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households. It is a major watershed in our nation's journey towards cleaner and more sustainable energy, said Md. Habibur Rahman, senior secretary of Power Division under Bangladesh's Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. A number of projects implemented in Kenya under BRI have positively contributed to environment protection and conservation, said Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan international relations scholar. The Nairobi Expressway, built in partnership with China Road and Bridge Corporation, has included the integration of plants along the pillars and walls of the road, to act as carbon sinks for the emissions produced on the expressway as well as the lower road. The Nairobi Global Trade Centre has adopted green building technologies to ensure it cushions the environment from harmful emissions. The tower uses low-E glass to reflect heat while letting light in, and a breathable curtain wall instead of air conditioners. It also pledged to be a plastic straw-free zone. Mostafa Kareem, a member of the faculty for irrigation and hydraulic engineering at Cairo University, spoke highly of BRI projects in Egypt such as the Central Business District (CBD) project in the new administrative capital and the Cairo light rail transit system. These initiatives are not only aimed at enhancing transportation and urban development but also at reducing emissions and supporting Egypt's goals for sustainable development, said Kareem. This photo taken on Sept. 11, 2023 shows the construction site of Central Business District (CBD) project in the new administrative capital, east of Cairo, Egypt. (XinhuaAhmed Gomaa) In partnership with China, Ethiopia is harnessing its massive solar energy potential by launching a research center to fast-track renewable energy development in the East African country. In June this year, with financial support from the Ministry of Commerce of China, the United Nations Development Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Energy of Ethiopia, the Administrative Center for China's Agenda 21, an affiliated entity of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and China Agricultural University, has implemented a project entitled Biogas, Biomass and Solar Trilateral Cooperation -- Transitioning to Sustainable Energy Uses in the Agro-industry between China and Ethiopia. The project primarily supports renewable energy technology dissemination and scale-up for Ethiopia's climate-resilient growth. Hence, the BRI is contributing reduction of carbon emission in Ethiopia, said Melaku Mulualem, senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Strategic Affairs. As the green transition in China is rolled out, Beijing has emphasized South-South cooperation in renewable energy projects. Technology transfer from China to the BRI countries has been scaled up. Throughout the 10 years of the existence of the collaborative initiative, a significant amount of work has been done related to solar energy and hydraulic resources built in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, said Eduardo Regalado, senior researcher at the International Policy Research Center of Cuba. PRESERVING LAND WATER RATHER THAN DEGRADING Some claimed that the BRI would cause irreversible damage to land and water. However, experts and people involved in the actual projects in the host countries have drawn a different conclusion. Kenya is one of the African countries that are increasingly learning from the enviable experiences of China in terms of controlling desertification, said Adhere. Kenyan scientists at the Sino-Africa Joint Research Centre are working with counterparts from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography to help address the challenge of desertification not only in Kenya but also in northern African countries. The Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in Uganda is another example, said Jonathan Tabalanga, an international relations expert and lecturer at Uganda's Cavendish University. If you look at the Nambigirwa Bridge, the longest in the country (1.5 km), it preserved the environment. They did not pour sand, or soil waste in the swamp, but they created a bridge so that the water levels remain the same, explained Tabalanga. They always ensure that the issues of environment are taken care of. This photo taken on January 24, 2023 shows the Kingfisher oil field in Kikuube, Uganda. (Photo by Hajarah NalwaddaXinhua) Another example mentioned by Tabalanga is the Kingfisher oil project built in partnership with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in Uganda. Located in a complex ecological and residential environment, the company has been dedicated to employing technological means to minimize the project's impact on the surrounding environment. In the Oromia region of Ethiopia, the China-built Genale-Dawa III Multipurpose Hydropower Project aided in combating desertification through the provision of electricity to the nearby communities that had been dependent on firewood for their power demand. Several mini-projects were also conducted including the construction of bridges and ditches as part of an effort to prevent erosion and land degradation during the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway project. The communities living in China-built wind farms in different parts of Ethiopia also no longer contribute to desertification in their quest for power, said Mulualem. WELL-PREPARED ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Since its debut, the BRI has been conceptualized as the Green Belt and Road as the Chinese government is committed to sustainability, environmental protection, and international environmental standards. In 2015, the Belt and Road Initiative Action Plan was released by the Chinese government, outlining the vision and framework of the BRI and emphasizing the importance of environmental protection and sustainability in BRI projects. China and BRI participating countries have also established frameworks for conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Guidelines for BRI projects, which helped ensure that environmental concerns are addressed during project planning and implementation. At the first BRI Forum in 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that efforts should be made to strengthen cooperation in ecological and environmental protection and build a sound ecosystem to realize the goals set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme on building a green Belt and Road for 2017-2022, reached environmental cooperation agreements with more than 30 countries and international organizations, launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development together with 31 countries, and formed the BRI International Green Development Coalition with more than 150 partners from 40-plus countries. Before any BRI project kicks off in Ethiopia, the government of Ethiopia and experts from China conduct biodiversity assessment, incorporate principles related to biodiversity conservation into the BRI green finance framework, strengthen science-based support, and promote the consistency of standards and norms related to biodiversity conservation, said Mulualem. This photo taken on November 26, 2022 shows main gate of an underwater tunnel in Chattogram, Bangladesh. The underwater tunnel in Bangladesh built by a Chinese company has marked the civil works completion of its south tube. (Xinhua) All these international projects, including the Chinese (ones), done by international companies all go through an environmental impact assessment before the projects take shape. So, I think for the West to come out and argue that most of these projects impact the environment negatively is just wrong, said Tabalanga. All the development projects which were implemented earlier here have shown they have had a positive impact, especially in the environmental field in Bangladesh and are not posing a threat to our environment, said Barua, citing projects like the Padma Bridge, Elevated Expressway, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, and the Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant. GREEN PROJECTS, GREEN FINANCE Besides, China has promoted green finance, including green bonds and green investment practices, to fund environmentally friendly projects within the BRI framework. Green finance channels funds into renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which help reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating environmental impact and contributing to a more sustainable energy mix. Investments in green finance can also support infrastructure projects that focus on energy-efficient technologies and practices. This includes the construction of buildings with high energy efficiency standards and the implementation of smart infrastructure solutions. A case in point is the Global Trade Centre in Nairobi, said Adhere. Furthermore, green finance encourages the incorporation of technologies and designs that minimize carbon footprints. This photo taken on May 8, 2022 shows a section of the Nairobi Expressway built by China Road and Bridge Corporation in Nairobi, Kenya. (XinhuaDong Jianghui) This can include using low-carbon materials, improving transportation systems, and adopting sustainable construction practices. Examples implemented in Kenya under BRI include the SGR and the Nairobi Expressway, Adhere said.

I stayed in a distant aunt's apartment, in the spare room that doubled as a shelter from missile attacks. Its two-foot thick walls were curious to me, and the idea of missiles raining down on suburban Tel Aviv was rather abstract. Such security concerns felt very localised, and the global dynamics of War on Terror felt like a different epoch. The Hamas terror attacks and Western response are a sharp return to those dynamics, though we had been living with their offspring for some time - the new systems of censorship have their origins in the War on Terror, which then shifted to countering violent extremism, and expanded to countering anti-elite dissent more broadly. The earth pivots on its axis once more. I have seen five in my lifetime - the fall of communism, 911, Trump and Brexit, Covid, and now the Hamas attacks. The last three pivots coming in just the past seven years. Apart from the first, all the others resulted in a radical winding back of civil liberties. That looks to be the case again and it could get far worse, especially if there are more attacks in the West itself. I am now old enough to see the pattern in these moments. There are calm heads who have the best interests of the people at heart, and there are always a plethora of opportunists who do not. On each occasion, we are asked to give up our liberties, and in most cases, we never see them returned. Just last month President Biden renewed the US state of emergency put in place since 911. 22 years. The Neocons paved the way for the new authoritarianism with their secret courts, lies on WMDs and the Iraq invasion, and the construction of a massive system of surveillance. Corporate liberals enthusiastically jumped on board, expanding the surveillance state and then remodeling the War on Terror to counter violent extremism, justifying the micro-policing of the internet to combat hate and disinformation. Both approaches were devoid of principles - rather each asked Which political grouping is most advantageous to me? and went about weaponizing the tools at their disposal. For woke liberals and progressives that meant an alliance with the intelligence community and the administrative state (the Censorship-Industrial Complex) to counter populist movements and to rein in dissent more broadly. This system seemingly reached its zenith during Covid, where freedom of expression advocates turned a blind eye (or worse joined) efforts to censor legitimate speech. We may be nowhere near the zenith. Now that alliance with the administrative state is fraying. Progressives and liberals in the digital rights space were happy to sign up for NATO-aligned censorship initiatives when the enemy was Russia. Many are unlikely to do the same for Palestine. In fact, many celebrated Hamas' pogrom. BLM Chicago tweeted their support of the massacre at the music festival, pro-Hamas protesters in Sydney chanted gas the Jews, and 34 Harvard student organisations claimed the rapes and killings committed by Hamas were entirely the fault of Israel. Just the day before too much side-eye could lose you your job. The fact that progressives found it hard to condemn the killing of Jews (orthodox, left, right, liberal alike) or need to contextualise a Nazi being applauded in Canada's parliament, shows us just how crazy things have become. But this speech has also exposed the bigotry of those who claim to fight bigotry. No one can seemingly walk and chew gum. If there is any silver lining it is that the depths of this hypocrisy have been exposed, along with the people who coddle and fail to confront them. And now the censors are coming for the woke and the free Palestine movement. Already positions are shifting radically on censorship - some free speech champions on the right now advocate censorship, and previously enthusiastic censors on the left now rail against getting canceled. In France, Germany, Britain, and Australia there are crackdowns on legitimate protest and free expression in support of Palestine and against the war. Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, went further with his threats against social media. Only a few months ago I wrote that it is important to return to strong principles of free expression, including for ideas we dislike. The shoe will one day again be on the other foot. When that day comes free speech will not be the enemy of liberals and progressives, it will be the best possible protection against the abuse of power. That day has come much more quickly than I anticipated. Those who have grounded themselves in politics rather than principles have created a great unmooring that has left us vulnerable to the latest political huckster and led us down a dark, dark, path. This is not a call for equanimity - that Jews should just have to deal with threats to protect freedom of expression, and vice-versa. There are laws to deal with calls for actual violence and the glorification of terrorism. That should be the small reserve of hate speech laws, rather than micro-policing the clumsy speech of everyday citizens. But unfortunately, it will probably not work like that. The Pandora's box of everyday surveillance was opened by the Neocons and expanded by corporate liberals and their woke allies. Into that current will be swept speech and expression of all kinds; hateful, constructive, and otherwise. Is the speed and force of this shift enough to convince those who had abandoned free speech to renormalise it as a principle? The shoe is now on the other foot.",https://www.activistpost.com/2023/10/the-post-cold-war-origins-of-the-surveillance-state.html,-1
2023-10-17 21:01:01.871,2023-10-123314925,warehouse_fire,52d8fd3f-0f55-4e78-af69-fdb8549a289f,"Operators of illicit lab seek 50M from Fresno County, Reedley over seizure, cleanup","The company behind a clandestine biological lab in Reedley has lodged multimillion-dollar claims against the city of Reedley and the county of Fresno over the destruction of materials and mice that were allegedly being stored illegally inside a warehouse. Universal Meditech Inc. -- which was operating without a city business license in a large warehouse on I Street in downtown Reedley when it was shut down earlier this year -- filed its claim with the city of Reedley this week, seeking 30 million to compensate for what the company's attorney called a huge financial loss of assets from the unlawful seizure by city officials of its property. A claim against Fresno County for more than 50 million was filed on Friday, accusing the county's health department of wrongful seizure and destruction of more than 30 freezers and refrigerators containing biological assets. Southern California attorney Stephen J. Thomas of the Thomas Business Law Group filed the claims on behalf of the company. The Fresno Bee reached out by phone to Thomas' office in City of Industry to ask questions about the claims, but received no response as of mid-afternoon Tuesday. Reedley, Fresno County respond to claims We are baffled, Reedley City Manager Nicole Zieba told The Fresno Bee on Tuesday. Everything we did was under court order. We even took criticism for moving so slowly, but we wanted to make sure we did everything carefully and legally. Fresno County spokesperson Sonja Dosti issued a statement that the County believes there is no merit to the claim. The abatement by the County and City has been conducted according to court order and all applicable legal processes. In the meantime, the city has issued its own demand letter to Universal Meditech and an associated company, Prestige BioTech Inc. -- both companies whose owners hail from China -- as well as the owner of the warehouse at 850 I Street, for payment of more than 310,000 to make up for the costs incurred so far by the city of Reedley and Fresno County for clearing out the biological materials, mice, chemicals, equipment and undistributed medical test kits found in the facility. Universal Meditech's claims for compensation The claim asserts that after operating legally in Tulare and Fresno since 2015 into 2022, Universal Meditech was preparing to move from an industrial building at the south end of Fresno to a new building near Fresno Yosemite International Airport. But, Thomas wrote in documents accompanying both claims, a dispute with its landlord prompted the company to pull up roots before the new building was ready. Accordingly, UMI was forced to rent a temporary warehouse, Thomas said. After an urgent search, UMI finally rented 850 I St. in Reedley for half a year, and completed the move between November 15th and 20th, 2022. The claims state that soon after the move, Reedley city officials almost immediately ... continued to check and harass staff at the warehouse before from March onwards, the temporary warehouse was completely sealed up. Collectively, Thomas wrote, agents from a collection of federal, state and county agencies repeatedly carried out onerous inspections and investigations on the temporary warehouse. Among actions for which the company is seeking compensation are: The extent of the actual damage cannot be ascertained accurately at this time because UMI has been locked out of the warehouse, according to the claim documents. Claim says destruction of mice was 'beyond the authority' The claim does not address allegations by the city that the company was operating illegally without a business license inside the warehouse or that representatives of Universal Meditech and Prestige Biotech were evasive in their replies as city inspectors and county health officials sought to determine the extent of the operations and learn what was being stored in the warehouse. But the claim asserts that the destruction of mice in April, carried out under an abatement warrant after declarations that they were being neglected and kept in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, went beyond the authority granted by the warrant. Additionally, Thomas wrote that Fresno County's application in June for a court warrant to destroy biological materials stored in refrigerators and freezers on the basis that the warehouse contained viruses and bacteria that seriously endangered public health was a lie. The company, he added, was given only one day's notice before the materials were destroyed, and company representatives were not allowed to observe and collect evidence on site. The claim also complained about the short-circuiting of its planned relocation back to Fresno. The new factory building near the Fresno Yosemite International Airport has been built, but Thomas wrote that city officials have delayed the approval because UMIPBI will be the tenant. The improper seizure and unauthorized law enforcement activities, as well as the resulting local public media, which published many false and distorted reports and information, led to the inability to carry out the relocation of the new factory building, Thomas wrote. The landlord at the new building terminated the lease agreement with Universal Meditech and Prestige Biotech in August, he added. New Fresno, Fresno County ordinances As The Bee covered efforts by the city and county in August to clean up the warehouse site, it reached out by email to six different representatives and attorneys for Universal Meditech and Prestige Biotech for comment on the investigation, but received no response. The Bee also did not receive any complaints or request for correction from the company or its attorneys over its coverage. In the wake of the shutdown of the Reedley lab, the city of Fresno subsequently passed an ordinance to regulate laboratories that deal with infectious diseases -- including adding potential criminal penalties for those who violate the law. The ordinance received final approval from the Fresno City Council on a unanimous 7-0 vote on October 5, and will take effect in early November. County leaders say they, too, expect to enact an ordinance allowing the health department to conduct annual inspections of private labs. The Chinese ownership of the two companies, coupled with revelations that the lab was reportedly dealing with COVID-19, raised concerns about possible connections between the lab and the Chinese government. The situation at the Reedley warehouse, described as unprecedented in the experience of state and federal regulators, has also given rise to investigations by two separate panels of the YOU.S. House of Representatives, including the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article280640875.html,-1

Blast kills hundreds at Gaza hospital; Hamas and Israel trade blame, as Biden heads to Mideast KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Around them in the grass were blankets, school backpacks and other belongings. Outrage over what many believed was an Israeli strike flared across the region, a day before President Joe Biden was due to arrive to show support for Israel and try to prevent the war from spreading. The carnage unfolded as the YOU.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas' deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hamas called Tuesday's hospital blast a horrific massacre, saying it was caused by an Israeli strike. The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often cooperates with Hamas in their shared struggle against Israel. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital at the time and that intelligence from multiple sources indicated it was responsible for the failed rocket launch that hit the hospital. Destruction at Gaza hospital increases stakes for Biden's trip to Israel and Jordan WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's efforts to tamp down tensions in the escalating war between Israel and Hamas faced a bloody setback Tuesday when, shortly before his expected departure for the Middle East, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas withdrew from scheduled meetings to protest an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike but the Israeli military said it had no involvement and pinned the blame on a misfired Palestinian rocket. Abbas' cancellation, disclosed by a senior Palestinian official, reflects an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of American influence in the region as Biden visits Israel and Jordan on Wednesday. Biden's decision to put himself in a conflict zone -- the same year he made a surprise visit to Ukraine -- demonstrates his willingness to take personal and political risks as he becomes heavily invested in another intractable foreign conflict with no clear end game and plenty of opportunity for things to spiral out of control. The high-stakes presidential trip is emblematic of Biden's belief that the United States should not turn back from its central role on the global stage and his faith that personal diplomacy can play a decisive role. War between Israel and Hamas raises fears about rising US hostility A fatal stabbing in Illinois, a gun pointed at protesters in Pennsylvania, vandalism at synagogues and harassment of staff at a Palestinian restaurant all are raising fears that the war between Israel and Hamas is sparking violence in the United States. The tensions follow a familiar pattern of crimes against Jewish and Muslim communities rising when conflict erupts in the Middle East and Americans have been killed or taken hostage. We have a two pronged threat to American faith communities, said Brian Levin, founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernadino. While it is too soon to say with certainty whether anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish crimes have increased during the war, hate crimes overall increased in the YOU.S. last year. In its annual report released Monday, the FBI estimated that hate crimes increased by 7 to 11,634 cases in 2022 compared to the previous year. With 1,124 incidents, anti-Jewish attacks were the second most reported hate crime, after anti-Black cases. There were 158 reported incidents of anti-Muslim attacks, and 92 reports of anti-Arab cases, according to the report. Civil rights organizations, however, believe that even before the Hamas attacks in Israel, crime data did not reflect reality due to a lack of participation by local police departments and internalized fear among the Muslim population, said Robert McCaw, director of governmental affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In 2021, the Othering  Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, released a study in which 85 of those who were subjected to Islamophobia said they did not report it to authorities. Republicans reject Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot, signaling more turmoil ahead WASHINGTON (AP) -- More turmoil ahead, Republicans rejected Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot Tuesday, as an unexpectedly numerous 20 holdouts denied the hard-charging ally of Donald Trump the GOP majority needed to seize the gavel. Additional voting was postponed as the House hit a standstill, stuck while Jordan works to shore up support from Republican colleagues to replace the ousted Kevin McCarthy for the job. Reluctant Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. Next votes were expected Wednesday. We are going to keep working, Jordan said at the Capitol as evening fell. It is been two weeks of angry Republican infighting since McCarthy's sudden removal by hard-liners, who are now within reach of a central seat of YOU.S. power. The vote for House speaker, once a formality in Congress, has devolved into another bitter showdown for the gavel. Jordan said after the first vote that he was not surprised and expected to do better in the next round. But the afternoon dragged on with no further votes Tuesday. Trump returns to his civil fraud trial, hears an employee and an appraiser testify against him NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump returned Tuesday to the civil fraud trial that imperils his real estate empire, watching and deploring the case as an employee and an outside appraiser testified that his company essentially put a thumb on the scale when sizing up his properties' value. Incensed by a case that disputes his net worth and could strip him of such signature holdings as Trump Tower, the former president is due to testify later in the trial. But he chose to attend the first three days and came back Tuesday to observe -- and to protest his treatment to the news cameras waiting outside the Manhattan courtroom. Star witness Michael Cohen, a onetime Trump fixer now turned foe, postponed his scheduled testimony because of a health problem. Instead, Trump company accountant Donna Kidder testified that she was told to make some assumptions favorable to the firm on internal financial spreadsheets. Outside appraiser Doug Larson said he did not suggest or condone a former Trump Organization comptroller's methods of valuing properties. It does not make sense, Larson said of the way the ex-controller reached a 287.6 million value for a prominent Trump-owned retail space in 2013. Ukraine uses US-provided long-range ATACMS missiles against Russian forces for the first time WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has quietly delivered a small number of long-range ballistic missiles that Ukraine said it urgently needed and that President Joe Biden promised last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Tuesday, saying they were used on the battlefield against Russia and executed very accurately. Today I express special gratitude to the United States, Zelenskyy said in his evening address, adding that the missiles have proven themselves. The YOU.S. has refused to discuss the delivery publicly, but officials familiar with the move also confirmed it earlier in the day. Fewer than a dozen of the missiles got into Ukraine within the last few days, said officials. Their arrival at the warfront gives Ukraine a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before an official announcement and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The delivery of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, was shrouded in secrecy, with the expectation that the first public acknowledgment would come when the missiles were used on the battlefield. That intense secrecy is a marked change from previous YOU.S. weapons sent by the Biden administration. In nearly all other cases, the YOU.S. has publicly announced its decision prior to the weapons and equipment being shipped overseas. Because of lingering YOU.S. concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (about 300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range and carry cluster munitions, which, when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead. According to a YOU.S. official, the ones delivered to Ukraine have a maximum range of a bit more than 100 miles (roughly 160 kilometers). Belgian police kill Tunisian man suspected of shooting 3 Swedish soccer fans, killing 2 of them BRUSSELS (AP) -- Authorities in the Belgian capital shot and killed a Tunisian national on Tuesday hours after they say he gunned down three Swedish soccer fans, killing two of them, and posted a video online in which he claimed credit for the attack and said the Quran was a red line for which he is ready to sacrifice himself. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive for Monday night's attack, which happened not far from where Belgium's men's soccer team was hosting Sweden in a European Championships qualifier. The match was suspended at halftime and the more than 35,000 fans were kept inside the stadium as a precaution while the attacker was at large. Amateur videos of the attack posted on social media showed a man wearing an orange fluorescent vest pull up on a scooter, take out a large weapon and open fire on people getting out of a taxi. He chased them into a building to gun them down. He was also filmed calmly loading his weapon as cars drove by slowly. Sweden's foreign ministry said the men who were killed were in their 60s and 70s, and the man who was wounded is in his 70s and remains hospitalized. Hours after the suspect disappeared into the night and a manhunt was launched, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap Are 3D mammograms better than standard 2D imaging for catching advanced cancers? A clinical trial is recruiting thousands of volunteers -- including a large number of Black women who face disparities in breast cancer death rates -- to try to find out. People like Carole Stovall, a psychologist in Washington, D.C., have signed up for the study to help answer the question. We all need a mammogram anyway, so why not do it with a study that allows the scientists to understand more and move closer to finding better treatments and ways of maybe even preventing it? Stovall said. The underrepresentation of women and minorities in research is a long-simmering issue affecting health problems including Alzheimer's disease, stroke and COVID-19. Trials without diversity lead to gaps in understanding of how new treatments work for all people. Broken rail caused fatal Colorado train derailment that collapsed bridge, early findings show A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. Prosecutors seeking to recharge Alec Baldwin in fatal shooting on set of Western movie 'Rust' SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Special prosecutors are seeking to recharge actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie in 2021, describing Tuesday their preparations to present new information to a grand jury. New Mexico-based prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said they will present their case to the grand jury within the next two months, noting additional facts have come to light in the shooting on the set of the film Rust that killed Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin, a coproducer of the film, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a rustic chapel on a movie-set ranch near Santa Fe when the gun went off on October 21, 2021, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza. Additional facts have come to light that we believe show Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza, Morrissey and Lewis said in an email. We believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of New Mexico citizens to determine from here whether Mr. Baldwin should be held over for criminal trial. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer -- but not the trigger -- and the gun fired. Newsletters Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Bush proposed 92 billion in supplemental spending to fund ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Gulf Coast reconstruction. Disappointing those seeking fiscal responsibility from Congress, the House passed legislation containing these expenditures without offsetting the cost by cutting less important spending elsewhere in the budget. And now the Senate Appropriations Committee has added 14 billion in new spending to its version of the bill-much of it totally unrelated to the war or Gulf Coast reconstruction. Senators attached 700 million to reroute a railroad to facilitate casino development in Mississippi, 4 billion for a farm bailout even as the farm economy booms, 594 million in additional highway spending (on the heels of last year's 286 billion highway bill), 1.1 billion for the fisheries industry, 2.3 billion to combat avian flu (on the heels of 3.8 billion appropriated last December), an additional 20 million more for poorly managed AmeriCorps program, and other increases. As the bill moves to the floor, senators are threatening to add billions more for milk subsidies, veterans' health care, and the Army Corps of Engineers. All told, Senators may exceed the President's spending level by 25 billion.1 Senators should reject all of these wasteful items, and the President should make clear that he will veto the bill if the Senate is unable to muster a modicum of fiscal responsibility. The bill has sparked a firestorm of criticism from fiscal conservatives and increasing skepticism from the press. Much of this has focused on a 700 million earmark backed by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Thad Cochran (R-MS) for Mississippi's Railroad to Nowhere. In terms of sheer profligacy, this earmark far exceeds even Alaska's infamous Bridge to Nowhere. In comparison to the train's 700 million price tab, the 220 proposed for the Alaska bridge is less than a third the price of the LottCochran earmark. And although the bridge's purpose and benefits were questionable, details of the project were clear and fully disclosed, and lawmakers and citizens could judge it on its merits, or lack thereof. The Railroad to Nowhere proposal, in contrast, is anything but clear and straightforward, and contradictory details about its motivation and implementation continue to leak out from Mississippi. Mississippi's senators contend that the proposal is intended to improve rail safety, but as The Washington Post has reported, similar safety issues exist nationwide and Mississippi's rail-accident rate from 2001 to 2005 reached a 30-year low.2 In a series of on-site discussions between one of the authors of this paper (Utt) and Mississippi business and political leaders, the issue of safety never arose. Rather, local leaders considered the proposal's purpose to be removing noisy and disruptive freight trains from a region that is ripe for extensive redevelopment as a New Urbanist fusion of Miami Beach condominiums and Las Vegas casinos. As they described the plan, the freight trains would be rerouted to existing tracks several miles north and the CSX line and right of way would be reused for light rail that would whisk gamblers and tourists from the new hotels to the new casinos, the new golf courses, and the new restaurants that will soon be built along the coast.3 In effect, the freight line rearrangement would be a component of one of the largest real estate deals in the nation.. Under the circumstances, it is not clear what purpose the 700 million sought from federal taxpayers would serve. Would it compensate CSX for its valuable right of way, the property it will be giving up, and the nearly 300 million that it spent to repair the line following Hurricane Katrina? Would part of the proposed funding go to construct the new light rail system, or would that be part of a future federal earmark? Whatever they intend, Mississippi's senators owe their colleagues and American taxpayers a detailed explanation of how this extraordinary sum of money-it would be the largest earmark in American history, according to a report by the Christian Science Monitor4-would be spent. Senators Lott and Cochran say this planned development is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lift the incomes and improve economic opportunities of the citizens of Mississippi. They note correctly that Mississippi lags the rest of the nation in virtually every quality-of-life measure and is the poorest state in the union. While their concern for their constituents' well-being is appropriate, the rest of the nation's taxpayers still should not finance a massive real estate deal that may do little for Mississippi's poor and is certain only to benefit private developers and casino operators. If the redevelopment opportunity is as promising as the Senators and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour say, then the government of Mississippi and the cities and counties along the coast should create a unified redevelopment authority that would borrow to pay for new transportation infrastructure and service that debt with a portion of the new revenues that they believe the development will generate. But not all in Mississippi are convinced of the value of the proposed project. CSX, despite the payout it would likely receive, seems cool to the idea. Said spokesman Gary Sease: We rebuilt that line across the Gulf Coast as quickly as possible because it is a critical artery for us. It serves our purposes. It meets our customers' needs. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.5 Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour's Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding, and Renewal examined this project last December and concluded, That idea is no longer seen as practical because of the steep cost.6 Federal taxpayers should not be forced to spend 700 million to reroute a working rail line-especially one that just received 300 million in repairs-to make room for casino development. This extravagant expenditure is an insult to those wanting to rebuild homes and schools destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Senators should remove this provision from the supplemental legislation, and if they do not, President Bush should draw a line in the sand declaring this special interest addition to an emergency bill unacceptable.",https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/senators-should-derail-mississippis-railroad-nowhere,-1

In a letter to the higher authorities of East Coast Railway (ECoR), the deputy chief engineer, construction-II at Angul on October 14 said supporters of Pallahara MLA Pal led by his representative Gangadhar Jeet forcibly stopped work at three sites on October 9, 11 and 13. He also threatened officials and asked them to not resume works until issues raised by the MLA are resolved. The engineer further said at Khamar site, the MLA's supporters manhandled the workers. On October 13, the issue was brought to the notice of Angul collector who advised the officials to continue work and in the event of obstruction, lodge complaint in the local police station. Earlier, ECoR's contract firms - Shanti Construction Sambalpur Pvt Ltd, Nanda Infra Construction Pvt Ltd and BKD-SEC-SMT joint venture - had complained to the deputy chief engineer about the obstruction in work. Sources said the complaint of Shanti Construction was not received by Khamar police. Subsequently, the complaint was sent to the official e-mail of the Khamar IIC. Subsequently, Nanda Infra and BKD-SEC-SMT also lodged complaints with police on October 16 and 17. Expressing shock over the activities of BJD workers, Sachetan Nagarik Manch led by its president Bimal Bisi and general secretary PP Ray drew the attention of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to the matter and sought his intervention to remove bottlenecks plaguing the Talcher-Bimlagarh new rail line project in Angul. They said the project work is underway up to 52 km till Khamar from Talcher. But work on the 17 km Khamar-Pallahara has been stalled forcibly. The new rail line project was sanctioned in 2003-4 but it continues to linger. They said due to delay in land acquisition, the project work in Sundargarh and Deogarh districts is yet to start from Bimlagarh end. Contacted, an unfazed Pal said ECoR contractors are causing inconvenience to the public by cutting roads without black-topping diversions and removing debris from blasting. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is giving importance to the project and BJD members are also in favour of it. However, the ECoR is paying no heed to the inconvenience of people and its officials are not attending meeting called by the administration, the BJD MLA added.",https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2023/oct/18/bjd-mla-blamed-for-stalled-rail-line-work-2625025.html,-1

Biden, who departed for Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, had planned to meet with Arab leaders in Amman after visiting Israel in a show of support for the YOU.S. ally amid its war with Hamas. After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt, a White House official said. Biden sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded, the official said, adding that the president will consult in person with these leaders soon and will remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days. A Jordanian official told NBC News that all parties agreed to the cancellation, saying that the summit would not achieve any goals under the current circumstances. Jordan on Tuesday morning had announced that King Abdullah would host a four-way summit in Amman the following day, with Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the situation in Gaza. An attack on al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, a Christian-run medical complex in central Gaza City, killed 200 to 300 people on Tuesday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry's spokesman, Ashraf Al Qudra, said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had targeted the hospital for bombing.

DENVER (AP) -- A truck driver was killed when a train derailed near Pueblo, Colorado, and caused a railroad bridge to collapse onto a major highway -- crushing the semitruck, spilling coal and mangled rail cars across the roadway and shutting down traffic indefinitely, authorities said Monday. The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said a few hours before Biden was set to take off that the trip would be rescheduled.

Paige Jane English, 19, of Gore, had never appeared in court before, but her life was described as a ''disaster'' by her lawyer Scott Williamson, when she stood in the dock in the Gore District Court on Wednesday. Williamson said English, who was also appearing on a shoplifting and a wilful damage charge, did not have an address for an electronically monitored sentence. She had a bad family backround and was stealing for her methamphetamine habit, but sending her to Christchurch Woman's Prison was ''a step too far,'' he said. A sentence of intensive supervision may be more appropriate, and if English breached her sentence, prison would be the next option available to the court, he said. Crown solicitor Olivia Taylor agreed. Judge Catriona Doyle said English had not engaged with the agencies that had tried to help her and her underlying attitude was all because of drugs, she said. Judge Doyle sentenced English to 12 months' extensive supervision and judicial monitoring. This is going to require you to turn up. I am prepared to give you a chance - I am prepared to give you a chance. I hope at the end of this sentence you understand what will happen if you breach,'' Judge Doyle said. English became emotional and angry when the judge mentioned a victim impact statement written by English's mother. The summary of facts, which was not read in court, says English and the victim are known to each other. On May 10, English sent a series of voice messages to the victim demanding that the victim pay 500, and said if it was not paid she would report the victim to the police for sexual offending against the defendant's 14-year-old cousin. English repeated the threat several times using recorded voice messages and text messages. In explanation, English told police that the victim had approached the defendant's 14-year-old cousin and offered them money for sex. On July 24, English was living at a Gore address and asked another person living there for money. When the victim declined, she began walking around the property, shouting and screaming. She tipped over a wheelie bin, threw items around the property and knocked a potted plant to the ground. The same day, English was at The Warehouse in Invercargill where she took clothing and lighters valued at 167.",https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/133140066/blackmailer-who-was-in-an-almighty-mess-avoids-jail-sentence,-1

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. SEMITRUCK DRIVER DIES IN COLORADO AFTER TRAIN DERAILS, SPILLING CARS AND COAL ONTO HIGHWAY The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. 'BIGFOOT' CAUGHT ON CAMERA DURING COUPLE'S ROMANTIC GETAWAY IN COLORADO The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average.

He was only 33 years old. Three days earlier, he had been hit by a train while working on the tracks at Cologne Trimborner Strae station. He was resuscitated at the scene of the accident, but eventually succumbed to his severe head injuries. The World Socialist Web Site recently learned this from his partner Katharina Lopes Duarte, who is also 33 years old. She does not accept how national rail operator Deutsche Bahn, for which Ali Ceyhan worked, is dealing with this accident. She is demanding justice and the exact circumstances of his tragic death. Ali's family supports her in this effort to the best of their ability. Speaking to the WSWS, Susen, Ali's sister, described the dark time that all her relatives are currently going through: I have lost my brother, my parents have lost their son, Katharina her partner. We have lost our sense of life, are in darkness. We are looking for answers and getting none. We want something to really change now, to increase safety on the railways. I am doing everything I can so that no one else will be in the same situation as us, losing a loved one, Katharina emphasised. Ali was a mechanic maintaining the points and would have taken his exam to be a master mechanic in November. The two had been together for ten years, they were planning a family. My heart is broken,she said. I have lost the love of my life. Katharina has energetically taken up an investigation into the unfortunate death death of her partner. She has contacted the press, media, Deutsche Bahn, the works council and the EVG trade union. Ali should not disappear as a number in the statistics, she says. But the real point of my initiative, Katharina continued, in public is that Deutsche Bahn cannot continue to point the finger at the little people and explain away every accidental death as human error. Her goal, is for Deutsche Bahn to take technical safety precautions to prevent such fatal accidents in the future. Ali had earned 1,700 euros net, she says. I do not think he was aware of how dangerous the job was. What exactly happened on the day of the accident, 11 September, she does not know. But when an employee of the organ donation association -- Ali was an organ donor -- then told her that this year he was collecting organs from railway workers in the North Rhine-Westphalia area for the third time, her ears perked up and she began to do some research. She discovered the WSWS article, which reported on nine fatal accidents that occurred on the railways up to 10 September 2023. It also briefly noted Ali Ceyhan's accident on 11 September. At that time, Deutsche Bahn had only published two lines about the accident, referred to in the article, but had not reported that it resulted in death. Ali, is thus, the tenth person to die on the railways this year! Questioning the workplace safety standards at Deutsche Bahn, Katharina immediately put into motion all the levers at her disposal. She approached Deutsche Bahn, the railway and transport union (EVG), the works council and numerous media outlets to raise the issue of the lack of security, which was apparently a widespread phenomenon. My friend overheard a conversation between Deutsche Bahn staff on the train, she reports, after which a repair team had no supervising staff to protect the team on the track. The senior staff member then refused to repair the train for safety reasons. Deutsche Bahn reportedly reacted by issuing warnings against colleagues. She said her friend then spoke to the group and informed them about Ali Ceyhan's work accident. While she has received support from railway employees, the reactions from Deutsche Bahn, EVG and the works council have been disappointing and outrageous. Deutsche Bahn sent her a standardised death notice, in the name of the company and the works council, which can only be described as distasteful, given the circumstances of her partner's death. It contained a short, superficial sentence of condolence, stating that Ali Ceyhan had died suddenly and unexpectedly. Outraged, Katharina wrote a letter in reply, explicitly opposing the publication of such an obituary. I am outraged and shocked by the mendacious sympathy of the works council, she wrote. Every accident is 'sudden and unexpected'. You have got to be kidding me. HE DIED WORKING FOR THE GERMAN RAILWAY, and you cannot deny that! It is more than obvious that you are only representing the interests of the company. This, she said, was outrageous. I will not allow you to play down this tragedy, she concluded. She said Deutsche Bahn has apologised and since proposed a different text that was more personal but also did not address rail safety. But safety is precisely what she, and the family are concerned about. Katharina made this clear in her letter to the EVG, of which Ali Ceyhan was a member. In it, she addressed the inadequate security precautions and the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn and EVG. Has Deutsche Bahn exhausted all technically available possibilities, considering that cars can already brake by themselves? she asked. Referring to the dangerous nature of the profession (locomotive drivers and related professions rank third among the most dangerous professions in Germany), she asked about the adequacy of the pay. Ali earned about 2,700 euros gross -- about 1,700 euros net -- a month. Is such a salary in relation to the danger Deutsche Bahn employees are exposed to every day? Where is the outcry from your union? For months, the collective bargaining dispute with Deutsche Bahn was reported. Why was the safety of the employees never addressed in this dispute? Ali's death could have been avoided, she wrote, expressing the hope that this letter will ensure that this issue is discussed publicly, and that Ali's death will thus serve a purpose, namely that his approximately 211,000 colleagues in Germany can go to work every day knowing that they will also return home safely to their families. She concluded by saying that Ali was a member of the EVG and asks, Their motto is: 'The railway and transport union is the strong professional interest group that collectively and reliably ensures ... good and safe working conditions for the entire workforce.' Is that really the case? I want to know specifically what exactly the union will do for its member Ali Ceyhan to hold Deutsche Bahn to account and to protect more members from death. In his terse reply, Cologne-based EVG secretary Wilfried Otten wrote that the EVG was always concerned that employers put safety first, but then evaded the specific questions and hid behind the ongoing investigations by the public prosecutor's office. Therefore, the EVG cannot comment on possible questions of guilt on the part of the employer.

That year, the Nighthawks went 9-3, reaching the state quarterfinals. It is fantastic. It is fantastic, Stott said. 6-1 is a great feeling -- a lot better than 1-6. This season, they won five games in a row to rise to No. 8 in the rankings. That is right in line with another quarterfinal opportunity -- or better. Oh, incredible. After something like that, all glory to God I got to say, IR senior quarterbackfree safety Dominic Norris said when asked about the 2023 start after last year's struggles. It is just incredible, it is a great feeling to do this but we know we were capable of this the whole time with all the work we put in. Stott went to Amphitheater High School, winning a state championship as a player in 1975. He has coached since 1983, when he was an assistant at Santa Rita while in med school. In 1998, Stott moved to St. George, Utah, where he and his wife Deborah, a critical care nurse, founded Zion Pain Management Center. Then, in 2012, he opened a second clinic in Henderson, Nevada. He said it was tough to balance coaching and his clinic. He said his medical experience does not really help in football, except in that one area. Not really, Stott said with a laugh. Maybe in helping people recover from injuries because I was a pain specialist, so injecting shoulders, knees, things like that probably help but most it gave me the liberty to be able to set my own schedule and that is what allowed me to coach. Working at Ironwood Ridge also means he returns to Amphitheater Public Schools. It is great, I love it, Stott said. I am happy to be back in the Amphi school district; great district; good tradition. We want to get back to winning ways. Stott was an assistant coach for 20 years at Pine View High School in St. George and head coach of the semi-pro Zion Lions. He was also at one point the head coach of the Mastini Canavase Italian Professional Football Team. It is amazing, he is one the greatest coaches ever, Norris said. He is smart, intelligent, high IQ and it is easy to have confidence in us with a person like that. He is just very smart, a very smart man. Norris passed for 502 yards in the Nighthawks' last game, a 37-22 win over Tucson High, which, according to AllSportsTucson.com, is the Southern Arizona single-game passing record. He passed former Marana signal-caller and current ASU quarterback Trenton Bourguet, who threw for 477 against Cienega in 2017. He passed for that much despite only practicing that Thursday due to an ankle injury. I just stayed to watch the film and just stuck to the plan and it went as we planned, to come out with the dub, Dominic Norris said. Junior Aiden Norris, Dominic's brother, caught three passes for 115 yards and two touchdowns against the Badgers. It is amazing. He is one of the best coaches I have ever had -- probably the best coach I have ever had, Aiden Norris said. He is helped me get so many opportunities to get on the field and get touchdowns. In St. George, the doctorfootball coach added another slash to his title: cookie bakery co-owner, though he does not think they will open up a southern branch of Sloth Cookies. He opened Sloth Cookies in 2019 with his son Logan. Probably not, he said, laughing again. A little busy but yeah that Sloth Cookies was a fun thing.

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring more than a month's worth of rain and 70mph winds. The most severe conditions will hit eastern Scotland where a 36-hour amber warning will be in place from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday. Separate yellow warnings have been put in place for Northern Ireland from 2pm on Wednesday until 10am on Thursday, and across vast swathes of Scotland and northern and eastern England from 6am on Thursday to 6am on Saturday. As the storm approaches, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. Rail operators cancelled trains and considered speed restrictions during the morning rush hour - as the Met Office issued an amber alert. member of the public gets caught by a wave on the shoreline after a morning swim in rough seas at Gyllyngvase Beach as strong winds arrive on the coastline on Tuesday in Falmouth, Cornwall Commuters struggle with their hair during windy weather on London Bridge in Central London on Tuesday Fields around Mepal in Cambridgeshire flooded after the New Bedford River burst its banks overnight with more flooding expected with the arrival of Storm Babet on Wednesday Strong waves strike Folkestone's Lighthouse in Kent on Tuesday ahead of Storm Babet's arrival Further travel disruption is expected across the UK - with National Rail already saying CrossCountry and Great Western Railway services between Exeter, Paignton and Plymouth are likely to be disrupted from 5.30pm today due to the severe weather. CrossCountry said no trains would run between Exeter and Plymouth from 6.30pm today until 11.30am tomorrow because of the conditions due to hit Dawlish, an exposed part of the line where the railway runs alongside the south Devon coastline. On the Isle of Wight there were no trains at Ryde Pier Head today due to the weather, with a replacement bus in place between the station and nearby Ryde Esplanade. Network Rail said its teams were concerned by the high risk of flooding and strong winds potentially uprooting trees, with weather specialists in its control room considering whether any speed restrictions will be required in Scotland this week. WEDNESDAY: Four days of rain warnings start with one that comes into force tomorrow THURSDAY: This is when the impact based on the number of warnings in place will be greatest FRIDAY: This is the same as Thursday, apart from the Northern Ireland warning which ends SATURDAY: Rain warnings will continue to cover much of England and Scotland on Saturday The Met Office's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain. This graphic shows total rainfall over the course of the warnings from tomorrow until Saturday A Nasa satellite image released today shows Storm Babet approaching Europe last night Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. Forecasters have warned of dangerous driving conditions and 'fast-flowing and deep floodwater' that could pose a danger to life. The warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. Some of these alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During Storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days.

There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves. The heaviest rain is expected in eastern areas of Scotland, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7 to 8 in Scotland, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. Communities in Aviemore, Highlands, Argyll and Bute, and Perthshire were badly impacted October, with weather so bad it was compared to the Beast from the East in 2018. Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83, and large parts of the Scottish rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. A 36-hour amber warning has been activated from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday Before the amber alert was issued today, Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. How Babet was named after a Dutch woman born during a gale Storm Babet was named after a woman from the Netherlands who said she had been born during a gale. The Met Office compiles its annual list of storm names in conjunction with the Dutch and Irish weather services. The Dutch weather service organised an open day last year, inviting visitors to submit suggestions for names - and Babet was among those involved, reported the Daily Telegraph. Further down the list is Storm Elin, which was named after a visitor who said they had a 'tempestuous granddaughter' with the same name. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. 'Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required, and we continue to work with the Met Office to monitor the situation 247. 'Impacts from surface water and rivers are likely, and with catchments saturated from recent heavy rain and flooding, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. 'There is also concern that surface water flooding may be exacerbated by debris blocking drainage, culverts, etc as a result of the high winds. 'If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel. Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: 'A disruptive period of weather is on the way. 'There is some high totals (of rain) which have the potential to disrupt travel plans... possibility of power cuts as well as the obvious risk of flooding. 'As you look at Wednesday, the first pulse of rain is looking to particularly influence Northern Ireland, Wales and the southwest of England, and into Thursday.

He added that further weather warnings are likely to be announced by the Met Office in the coming days. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers. Sam Hughes, the charity's water safety partner, said: 'The forecasted strong winds along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' Met Office chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. 'It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'For Scotland, this rain will be fairly heavy and persistent through much of the second half of the week and into the early part of the weekend.

'Gusts in excess of 60mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. It is likely Met Office warnings will be updated through the week.' It comes after southern England experienced its first autumn frost of the year yesterday as temperatures plummeted below zero. Charlwood in Surrey was the chilliest place in England with -1.4C (29F), while the cold snap was also felt in Benson in Oxfordshire, Farnborough in Hampshire and Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the mercury fell to -1C (30F). Gatwick and Stansted airports reported readings of 0C (32F), while temperatures in the Scottish Highlands fell to -2.2C (28F). As many as 35 weather stations reported temperatures below freezing last night, the Met Office said. The last such widespread frost was 172 days ago on April 27. The RAC was fearing an estimated 20 per cent spike in callouts yesterday on what it dubbed 'Flat Battery Monday' as car motors were more likely to fail due to the freezing night. In the Republic of Ireland, Met ireann has issued orange weather warnings for Cork and Waterford as spells of heavy rain and blustery winds were expected to arrive this morning. The Met ireann warning will be in effect from 6am today until 6am tomorrow. The forecaster told residents to expect considerable rainfall combined with 'blustery east to southeast winds at times'. Storm Babet could cause poor visibility, localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide, the forecaster said. Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kilkenny and Wexford were given a yellow rain warning that comes into effect at 6am today. A yellow rain warning for Connacht will be in place from noon today until noon tomorrow, while one for Antrim, Armagh and Down will begin at 6am tomorrow and run until midday on Thursday.",https://internewscast.com/news/storm-babet-hits-britain-met-office-issues-amber-warning-for-torrential-rain-and-80mph-gale-force-winds-as-extreme-weather-sparks-travel-chaos-with-trains-cancelled/,-1

The site was cleared of tons of coal and a half-dozen or more rail cars that plunged off a bridge that was torn away by the derailment. The accident resulted in the death of a 60-year-old truck driver from Compton, California who was headed north on I-25 when the truck was crushed by the debris. Following work by BNSF Railway workers to clear the mess, the Colorado Department of Transportation will work to restore the highway and re-open it. BNSF owns and operated the train that derailed. RELATED: Both directions of I-25 closed after train derails north of Pueblo With that impact, you know that there is going to be some damage. We are anticipating that and we are going to attack the problem as soon as we can so we can get drivers back on I-25, said CDOT spokeswoman Amber Shipley. The National Transportation Security Board said in a statement Tuesday that preliminary information, indicates that a broken rail just to the east of the I-25 bridge caused the derailment. The train was heading south on the east side of the highway and was about to cross over the bridge when the derailment happened. Train cars hit the 65-year-old bridge. NTSB investigators also believe the broken rail preceded the derailment and the bridge collapse occurred after the derailment, the statement went on to say. That will direct less attention to the integrity of the bridge, which showed cracks in its concrete supports in recent Google Map images before the derailment. More concerning is that there appeared to be no warning of problems ahead for the train crew. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warning systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, the NTSB said. Such systems are low-voltage electrical circuits that are an indication of rail integrity. When severed, the signal would indicate a problem. The NTSB's statement does not indicate whether a break in the rail line would have been significant enough to trigger a warning, or if the system was working. What was also unclear Tuesday was who owned the bridge. BNSF said it did not, but the state said there was conflicting information. CDOT Communications Director Matt Inzeo said the department was, going through every document that we have, to look into the provenance of the structure. He said they would reserve further comment until they could, give a definitive answer. RELATED: It could be days before Interstate 25 reopens after deadly Colorado train derailment, Polis says As the highway remained closed in both directions, drivers took Highways 50 and 115 as a detour routing them through Penrose west of Pueblo. It meant more business for places like Coyote's Coffee Den along 115. It is staying steady like this, said supervisor Wanda Massey. Traffic on Highway 50, she described was, way heavier, than usual. It meant a different experience, but one metro area residents know well; traffic jams. It takes 10 minutes to get across town.

According to a press release from the City of Richmond, officials will begin to remove hazardous waste at two F Street properties involved in the My Way Trading warehouse fire that took place in April. In a report released in August, the EPA noted that it detected lead and benzene when it investigated the scene of the fire. The cleanup will cost about 2.8 million and also address compounds like asbestos-containing material, lead and antimony, according to the EPA. The properties being cleaned up are located at 310 and 358 NW F St. The EPA's investigation determined that other properties involved in the fire did not demonstrate compounds requiring EPA cleanup, according to the City of Richmond. The EPA will move heavy machinery into the area for the cleanup next week. The main portion of cleaning will start in November, per the City of Richmond. The City of Richmond's top priority is protecting our residents, Mayor Dave Snow said in a release. The EPA's cleanup operation is an essential step towards ensuring their safety and the environmental health of our community. We will continue to work closely with the EPA as we move forward in addressing this unfortunate incident. In its release, the City of Richmond also clarified that the EPA issued a liability letter to Cornerstone Trading Group with regard to the fire. City officials have indicated that they did not receive a liability letter from the EPA. The city's administration stated that Cornerstone declined to pursue the cleanup of the site. The EPA will instead finance the project with federal funding, per the City of Richmond's release. Officials reported that the city is pursuing legal action against Cornerstone for the costs it has incurred to extinguish, investigate and clean up the fire. The fire broke out on April 11 and burned plastics located on the properties for days. An evacuation order was put in the place for area residents because of the fire. The order was lifted on April 16. Since the fire broke out, some Richmond residents filed a lawsuit against the facility's ownership group, asking for payment for punitive damages totaling more than 25,000. The lawsuit alleges the facility's unsafe working conditions contributed to the outbreak of the fire. The City of Richmond and the EPA did not provide a timeline for the cleanup. Officials did not indicate when the project will be completed. City officials reported that the hazardous materials due to be removed from Cornerstone's properties will not be placed in local landfills. The waste will be transported to appropriate hazardous disposal sites, per the City of Richmond's release.",https://fox59.com/news/epa-to-begin-cleanup-of-my-way-trading-site-fire-in-richmond-next-month/,-1

Visit image gallery to purchase the image. A person has died after being hit by a freight train at a level crossing in Darfield in rural Canterbury. A KiwiRail spokesperson said the loaded train was travelling from Darfield to Christchurch when the incident occurred, shortly after 7am. In an update about 11am police confirmed the person had died. They were struck on the Mathias St crossing near State Highway 73. Both roads are closed and the Serious Crash Unit has been advised. The KiwiRail spokesperson said there were warning lights and bells at the level crossing. The rail line is currently closed so this morning's TranzAlpine service from Christchurch to Greymouth has been replaced by buses. Police are making inquiries into the collision between the stolen Toyota Prius and the train passing through the crossing. The Prius was driven by what The New Zealand Herald understands were a couple of teens. They had been fleeing police before it was struck by the train.

Initial investigation into a train derailment in southern Colorado suggests the accident was caused by a broken rail, officials said Tuesday. The derailment, which took place on Sunday, sent 30 cars from a BNSF coal train off the tracks, collapsing a bridge over Interstate 25 and killing one person who was driving a semi trailer on the road. A nine-mile-long stretch of I-25, between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, will remain closed for days while crews clean up spilled coal and other debris. Authorities will need to investigate whether the spilled cargo damaged the roadway. Traffic that would normally travel on I-25 is being routed through Penrose, Colorado. Federal investigators will now try to determine what broke the rail, and why train crews did not receive warnings about the damage. SEE MORE: Train derailment closes Colorado interstate It was not known Tuesday whether the affected track had a system in place to monitor stress on track rails. Such systems can provide early warning before an accident occurs, and can stop approaching trains in the event of a track failure. BNSF had not responded to questions from The Associated Press on the matter as of Tuesday. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick told the outlet investigators would determine if the track was equipped with that system as part of their inquiry. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said.

John Rutherford's (R) Florida district while he was opposing Rep. Jim Jordan's (R-OH) Speakership bid in Washington D.C. The brazen late-morning shooting occurred on Interstate 95 near the World Golf Village in Florida's 5th district on Tuesday, causing a shutdown. Per News4Jax: According to the Sheriff's Office, suspects who were riding in the red car opened fire on a victim's vehicle on the interstate around 11:20 a.m. on Tuesday. The victim, who was driving, was struck by the gunfire and crashed into the center guard rail and a female passenger had glass-break injuries. Both were transported to local hospitals but their conditions are unknown. The red car sped off southbound and has not been found, the Sheriff's Office said.A white Mercedes was seen at the scene of the shooting surrounded by law enforcement vehicles including a forensics van. The highway's southbound lanes in the vicinity of World Golf Village were shut down until it later reopened. Rescue vehicles and over a half a dozen police cars were seen amid the pileup around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. As Breitbart News reported, Jim Jordan was denied the Speaker of the House gavel on Tuesday due to 20 Republican holdouts, including John Rutherford. The six Republican holdouts voting for Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Mike Lawler (R-NY), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-NE), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) and Don Bacon (R-NE). McCarthy has endorsed Jordan and voted for him, said the report. The seven Republicans voting for Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) were Reps. Steve Womack (R-AR), Mike Simpson (R-ID), John Rutherford (R-FL), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Tony Gonzales (R-TX), Kay Granger (R-TX), and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL). Scalise withdrew from the race last week after failing to see a path to victory. He, too, voted for Jordan, it added. Democrats have largely celebrated the holdouts as a delay of Jordan's speakership bid. A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier and an insurrection insider to the Speaker of this house would be a terrible message to the country and our allies, said Rep. Pete Aguilar (R-CA).",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/10/17/while-rep-rutherford-opposed-jordan-in-dc-random-shooter-shut-down-i-95-for-hours-in-his-florida-district/,-1

The commission called on the government to invest 22bn into public transport in Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Leeds, warning that congested roads and inadequate public transport ... constrains their economic growth. The NIC said that significant investment in intra-city links would not alone increase transport capacity, and measures such as congestion charging or workplace parking schemes would be needed to deter people from driving into the city centres. Schemes that charge to drive into cities, such as London's expanded ultra-low emission zone and the abandoned clean air zone in Manchester, have become politically difficult to implement. The commission chair, Sir John Armitt, acknowledged the controversy but said the commission's job was to give candid advice. You do not unlock economic growth by clogging up cities, he said. He added that the exact form of the charges should be left to city authorities, and called for greater devolution, saying: What is done locally has to be a local decision. Armitt said that maintaining existing infrastructure should be prioritised, with both Network Rail and National Highways likely to need more money to combat the effects of climate change. Noting the extent of potholes on much of the road network, he said: The state of country roads, I would argue, is not fit for purpose. Meanwhile, he described the government's decision to axe the northern leg of HS2 as the elephant in the room, with the recent move bringing what was Britain's biggest infrastructure project to a premature end. The commission said it had written the bulk of its national infrastructure assessment before Rishi Sunak's deeply disappointing decision to stop construction of the high-speed line north of Birmingham. The NIC, which on Wednesday released its National Infrastructure Assessment, published every five years, said the prime minister's decision left a major gap in the UK's rail strategy. Where until recently we had a long-term integrated strategy, we now have a collection of projects, Armitt said. I would hope that the future possibility of recovering that scheme HS2 to Manchester remains on the table. The supposed replacement for the 36bn cancelled HS2 work, Network North, has met with widespread scepticism, after several schemes were removed or amended after publication of the government's plan. Analysis from the Campaign for Better Transport has found that at least a third of the 36bn in the Network North plan would now be spent directly on road building and maintenance - with only 20 definitely dedicated to rail. Norman Baker, a spokesperson for the campaign, said: Reallocating billions from the cancelled northern leg of HS2 to road building adds insult to injury and puts an end to any remaining pretence of a government commitment to net zero.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/18/englands-biggest-cities-should-introduce-congestion-charges-says-commission,-1

The blaze was reported about 4:15 p.m. on southbound I-215 near the University Avenue exit, according to the California Highway Patrol. An Amazon truck, possibly bound for a warehouse, caught fire in the engine block, and the flames quickly reached the cab, though the driver was able to safely pull to the shoulder and exit the big rig, according to the CHP. The driver was not injured. Riverside Fire Department crews reached the location within minutes and initiated a fire attack. CHP officers shut down all southbound traffic at MLK Boulevard while firefighters worked to contain the blaze. A SigAlert was issued at 4:17 p.m. because of the hazard and ensuing traffic jam. At 4:30 p.m., the fire was fully contained, according to officials at the scene. The CHP reopened the HOV and No. 1 lanes three minutes later.

Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. High levels of arsenic have been found in ash on Maui, posing a potential health risk to anyone exposed to the debris from wildfires that damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings and claimed the lives of at least 98 people in early August. The findings, along with warnings to avoid contact with the ash, were announced in a news release Sunday from the Hawaii Department of Health. The preliminary analysis of ash from the remains of eight homes burned in the community of Kula also show other toxins including lead and cobalt. (MORE: West Maui Begins Reopening To Tourists) The blaze was one of several fires fueled by high winds and dry conditions in central and western Maui, including one that leveled the town of Lahaina on August 8. Officials expect to find similar toxins in the piles of ash there. Where Did The Arsenic Come From And Why Is It Dangerous? Arsenic is present in building materials made from sugar cane, commonly used in some older buildings in Hawaii. It is also found in Hawaii's volcanic soils. Wildfire ash is known to contain all kinds of toxins from metal, paint, wood, chemicals and anything else that might burn in a fire. But the high concentration of arsenic is of particular concern to Hawaii health officials. While the presence of these substances is not unexpected, the concentration of arsenic in particular demonstrates the high toxicity of the ash and reinforces the importance of avoiding exposure to the ash, State Health Director Dr. Kenneth Fink said. Parents Worry Air Is not Safe For Kids To Breathe Concern over toxins in the wildfire debris is one reason access to Lahaina is still being strictly monitored more than two months after the historic town burned. I feel like it is like back to COVID, where every decision you make is wrong and you are, like, putting your kids' lives at risk, Debbie Tau, who has two school-aged children, told The Associated Press. Tau worries the air is not safe for her children to breathe, and plans to keep them in a different school farther away. (MORE: 911 Calls From Deadly Lahaina Wildfire Show Residents' Terror And Desperation To Escape) School officials say they are monitoring the air quality and taking other steps to help make sure students are not exposed to toxins from the ash. The Department of Education continues to strongly believe that reopening our Lhain schools for in-person learning is critical for the well-being of our students and the community. We have been reassured that our campuses are safe for students and staff to be at based on current air quality conditions and the extensive environmental testing we have done over the last several weeks, DOE Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in the news release. No One Knows When Residents Can Return To Lahaina The Health Department says anyone in the area should take steps to limit contact with toxins in wildfire debris. It is important to remember that people can take action to minimize their exposure to these contaminants, including avoiding disruption of ash and wearing proper PPE when in impacted areas, Fink said. In addition, for people near the impacted areas, keeping surfaces clean of dust and ash and frequent handwashing will greatly reduce exposure. (MORE: Veteran Firefighter Describes Search Through Ashes of Lahaina Fire) There is no specific timeline for when residents might be allowed to return to Lahaina. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen has said it could be up to two years before people can even begin rebuilding their homes and disaster experts say it will take much longer than that to recover. About 13,000 people lived in Lahaina before the wildfire disaster.

Joshua Amburgy was shot by Miami Township officers last November after murdering Melissa Amburgy in a house on Valencia Drive. At the time, police said Joshua ran from the crime scene, but officers found him down the road at a different house on Geneva Court. Police said when they found him, Joshua was holding a butcher knife. Body camera footage from Miami Township police showed officers who found Joshua in the backyard of a residence. There, the two officers repeatedly yell at him to drop the knife. In the video, Joshua held the knife above his head and ran at the officers. One officer can be seen attempting to fire his Taser. Miami Township Police Chief Mike Mills said that Taser did not hit Joshua. Another officer can be seen firing two rounds from his gun, one of which hit Joshua, according to Mills. After that, officers searched and handcuffed Joshua; In his pockets, police discovered a second knife. Mills said the officers rendered aid until paramedics arrived. Mills said police followed protocol, but said when he comes at us with a knife, he gives us no choice -- zero choice. Joshua went to the hospital in serious condition. Mills said he is known to the police and has previously assaulted officers in other departments in the past. He was initially charged with attempted murder of a peace officer and felonious assault. In court Monday, he pleaded guilty to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole. Joshua is scheduled to be sentenced on November 21.

The ministry's spokesman, Ashraf Al Qudra, estimated that at least 200 were injured. Officials in Gaza and in Israel blamed each other for the carnage. Al Qudra said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had targeted the hospital for bombing. Hamas also blamed Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that, saying, It was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the IDF. Photos of the hospital showed fire engulfing the halls, shattered glass and body parts scattered across the wreckage. Videos posted to a Palestinian paramedic's Instagram stories show first responders arriving at the hospital and taking bloodied bodies out. Looking visibly she will-shocked in a video shared with NBC News, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah said there were three artillery attacks on the hospital. Part of the roof started to fall, he said, as he was treating a patient for a jugular injury. If the hospital bombing death toll of 200-300 is confirmed, it would be the deadliest incident inside Gaza since Hamas' terror attack on Israel on October 7. Doctors Without Borders said on the X platform that it was horrified by the bombing. This is a massacre. It is absolutely unacceptable, the organization said in a statement. The World Health Organization said it strongly condemns the attack. The hospital was operational, with patients, health and care givers, and internally displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries, it said in a statement. The WHO also said Israel's orders to evacuate the north side of the Gaza Strip last week -- the equivalent of 1.1 million people -- has been impossible to carry out for al Ahli and other hospitals. Before the hospital bombing, the estimated death toll in Gaza was more than 3,000 people, with more than 12,500 estimated to be injured. Israel's evacuation orders came as it appeared ready to launch a ground invasion into Gaza, bringing scores of military equipment to the border after Hamas terrorists killed 1,400 people and wounded 4,000 people in kibbutzim, at a musical festival and in streets across the south. The situation for civilians in Gaza has grown increasingly dire as Israel continues its airstrikes and imposes a blockade of water, food, fuel, medical supplies and electricity. Those resources are now in short supply, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled south. The bombing is the latest hit to the medical community in Gaza, which is already on the brink of collapse. Hospitals have provided refuge for people trying to escape the bombardment of the besieged enclave since last week. Dr. Ahmad Moghrabi, head of plastic surgery at Gaza's Nasser Hospital, likened the medical situation in Gaza to a disaster, and said most of his patients are women and children. It is like earthquake, everybody under attack, he said in a video diary sent to NBC News on Tuesday, where he is seen sobbing at his desk. Even my child -- 3 years old, she got injured. Really, it is pitiful -- my heart. Really, I am speaking to you, I want to cry.

The investigation that led to his arrest began after a complaint filed by the manager of the company, dedicated to the distribution of parcels and couriers. In his statement, he stated that they had hired a new delivery driver 15 days ago and that they had assigned him to work in an area of the province where he was going to deliver 500 packages valued at more than 20,000 euros with the company van. As he explained, after that delivery day, the worker did not appear at the warehouse nor could they contact him. The next day, the manager received a message in which the absent delivery driver demanded an advance on his salary. Otherwise, he threatened to destroy the van. After becoming aware of what happened, a patrol located the missing vehicle parked in an industrial park in Huesca, inside which the delivery man was sleeping. When he was questioned by the agents, he admitted that he had taken both the van and the package. For this reason, the man was arrested for a crime of misappropriation and the reported effects were seized. Later, the company was able to verify that inside the van were the 500 packages that were still pending delivery.",https://www.usanews.net/local/a-delivery-man-from-huesca-retains-the-delivery-van-and-its-contents-to-h97743.html,-1

A man was killed when the steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed onto his semi-truck that was passing beneath the bridge. He was identified by the Pueblo County Coroner as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California. Thirty cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over the interstate at 4:45 p.m. Sunday. The derailment scattered coal and mangled railroad cars across both lanes of I-25. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a news release. Both directions of I-25 are expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris from the site. HOW TO GET AROUND THE CLOSURE IF YOU LIVE SOUTH OF FOUNTAIN Drivers who may live or work south of Fountain and may be traveling toward Pueblo will be detoured to exit 110 toward Overton Road then toward Jerry Murphy; drivers will then head toward I-25 via westbound Colorado Highway 47. This access route is recommended for local traffic only, the CDOT spokesperson said. HOW TO GET AROUND THE CLOSURE IF YOU LIVE AROUND COLORADO SPRINGS If you are going south: Take Colorado Highway 115 toward Penrose and then turn east on US Highway 50 toward Pueblo. If you are going north: Exit I-25 at US Highway 50Colorado Highway 47 and travel west toward Colorado Highway 115. Drivers will then head north toward Colorado Springs. Those using Highway 115 will encounter a 12-mile-long construction project and should expect temporary driving surfaces and frequent traffic pattern changes. Impacts include only one lane being open in each direction, reduced speed limit of 45 mph and there is a width restriction of 11-feet. Vehicles over 11 feet should seek alternative routes other than CO 115: Those driving east should use US 50, CO 96 or CO 17. Those heading west should use US 50 and then use US 285.

They are reporting that initial testing is showing that loss rates can be reduced by up to 70 percent while not impacting the loading capacity or operation of the vessel. The industry increased its focus on container losses after a series of high-profile events in 2020 where hundreds or even thousands of boxes were damaged or lost overboard from a single vessel. The World Shipping Council in its report tracking container losses reported that 2020 was the worst individual year in recent memory with nearly 4,000 boxes lost overboard followed by over 2,000 containers lost in 2021. High losses such as the nearly 6,000 in 2013 had most often involved the loss of a vessel, whereas the recent numbers were due to bad weather and vessel handling. The number however fell dramatically in 2022 to just 661 boxes. Much of the industry's focus has been on weather conditions and a phenomenon known as parametric rolling which in a following sea is especially hazardous for container vessels. The industry has issued advisories on vessel handling while technology companies are working on systems that can predict dangerous sea conditions. Samsung however has taken a much simpler approach focusing on the racks and securing the lashing bridges. Their loss prevention device, known as Special Structure Anti-Container Loss, is an additional device attached to the lashing bridge. They are pointing to the severe shaking of boxes in bad weather as a key contributor to the losses. Once in place, Samsung reports the device minimizes the left and right movement of containers even in bad weather. They are reporting that they have obtained certification from four of the world's leading class societies, DNV, ABS, LR, and KR, and have completed over 10 patent applications outside of Korea for the device. They said in developing the device there was a focus on minimizing the size and weight to make it easy to install. They are saying it has a compact design and that it will work on existing ships without affecting container capacity. Samsung reports that the prototype structure is now at the Pusan National University. They are conducting strength testing as they seek to validate the product and increase its reliability. The device has already drawn the attention from the world's leading container shipping companies and Samsung anticipates that they will begin full marketing within the year for the product.",https://maritime-executive.com/article/samsung-develops-device-to-reduce-overboard-container-losses,-1

In this issue, ATA revises driver shortage numbers; CEVA gets robots; and record out-of-service orders. Mythbusters -- Last month, FreightWaves CEO and founder Craig Fuller published an article dismantling the driver shortage titled The perpetual truck driver shortage is not real. In that piece, he pointed out that while operating authority for motor carriers rose by 45 since 2019, truckload demand is only up 11 in the same period. The American Trucking Associations was not happy about it. X ATA claps back -- It did not take the ATA but a day to take notice of Fuller's article. It wrote, FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller calls the truck driver shortage a 'myth' in a recent piece of self-promotion, but his assertion collapses under the weight of facts and data. ATA's facts and data? It claimed that driver shortages in Romania and Poland help prove its case about a truck driver shortage in the USA. Speaking of data, here is some of ATA's from its 2019 driver shortage report: X Narratives -- The ATA goes on to say: ATA is not in the business of peddling narratives; that is FreightWaves' lane. However, on Monday at the 2023 Management Conference  Exhibition, American Trucking Associations Chief Economist Bob Costello said that the truck driver shortage has fallen from 80,000 to 60,000 drivers. The ATA's narrative in 2019 was that we would be short over 100,000 drivers by 2023. The underlying problems of the driver market have not gone away. -- American Trucking Associations Chief Economist Bob Costello X Surplus -- Costello is right that the underlying problems of the driver market have not gone away. Turnover is still a massive issue. The very clear reasons for those issues and complaints by drivers have not gone away either. In fact, looking at ATRI's latest survey, many of them are not even being considered by carriers. With outbound tender rejects below 4 and rates in the toilet, it is hard to peddle a narrative about a driver shortage, especially when there is not any ice cream melting on the dock. In addition, if you are looking for drivers, there are thousands on the market now after bankruptcies at places like Yellow and Meadow Lark Transportation. X P.S. Be nice to the drivers you have because you never know which terminal may snatch them away. Chart of the day Global Ocean Container Rates have just hit a 5-year low! After a brief rise in ocean container rates over the summer, peak season did not last long as demand began falling again last month and has driven ocean container rates down to a new YTD and 5-year low (global composite). -- FreightWaves' Luke Falasca Record new authorities  record FMCSA OOS orders In-N-Out -- John Gallagher reports, New-entrant out-of-service (OOS) orders issued to carriers will surge to an all-time high in 2023, according to the latest government data, a trend that has mirrored the dramatic increase in new-carrier operating authorities issued since 2020. In 2023, 35,000 carriers are likely to be put out of service. But why? It is simple -- there is not enough money in the market right now to maintain these new drivers. -- Daniel Koors, an owner-operator and council member for CDL Drivers Unlimited The pandemic trucking gold rush that attracted a record number of entrants did two things: It inflated capacity, which further drove down rates, and it brought in players who were not prepared for a downturn. Many new participants in the market used load boards and fed off the spot market, but now there is a 79 cent spread between contract and spot rates. Koors said, They do not have the back-office support, they do not have the capital, they jumped in when things were hot, and they did not set up the relationships needed to get them through this downturn. The bad news for those trucking companies is those relationships are on the good side of that spread. Want more bad news? There is not a driver shortage, there is a driver surplus. Stretch and spot -- Dropping off freight is about to get weird as you will be greeted by Boston Dynamics Spot robot dogs that patrol CEVA's new 135,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art transload facility. The Stat reports, Robots from Boston Dynamics will be used to serve customers at the site located within miles of Port of Long Beach and Port of Los Angeles. While Spot robot dogs will monitor the grounds, inside the facility are Boston Dynamics container-unloading bots named Stretch. A press release from CEVA says, Stretch can reach boxes up to 50 pounds in weight, its vision system enables it to adapt to different stacking configurations, and it does not require any pre-programming. While it is not clear how many robots will be deployed, CEVA says, They expect to process a total of 26,000 floor-loaded containers during the facility's first year in operation and to double its capacity within three years.

Rachel Powell, a Pennsylvania woman in her early 40s, mother of eight and grandmother of six, was convicted on nine federal counts back in July after a bench trial. Federal prosecutors sought eight years in federal prison for Powell, saying she developed an obsession with keeping former President Trump in power after his 2020 election loss, and that she even conducted surveillance at a female legislator's home before taking part in the Capitol attack. Powell, in emotional comments during her sentencing, said she did not want there to be any doubt about what she thought of what she did. I am deeply ashamed of my conduct, she said. I regret it, and it will never happen again. Powell said she feels remorse and regret every day. My conduct was disgraceful, Powell said.

Vermont State Police say they do not believe that two fatal shootings in the Northeast Kingdom over a two-day span are related. Maj. Dan Trudeau, head of the state police's criminal division, said during a Monday afternoon press briefing that the two deaths, one in Newport Town on Saturday evening and another in Wheelock early Monday morning, do not appear to be connected. I know probably everybody's curious if they are related incidents, Trudeau said to reporters, adding, There is been no evidence to indicate to us that they are related. Wheelock and Newport Town are about 30 miles apart. Police late Monday night identified Wilmer Rodriguez, 27, of Hartford, Connecticut, as the man killed Saturday evening in Newport Town. An autopsy completed Monday determined that the because of Rodriguez's death was multiple gunshot wounds and that the manner of death was a homicide, a release from state police stated. Police said troopers responded to a call at about 6:45 p.m. Saturday for a report of a man shot in a Farrar Road home and at the scene found a man, later identified as Rodriguez, dead inside. Trudeau, speaking at Monday's press briefing, said investigators believe the fatal shooting may be drug-related and that Rodrigues was targeted. No one was in custody as of Monday, according to Trudeau, and the investigation remains ongoing. In the Wheelock case, Trudeau said police responded to an emergency call around 6 a.m. Monday from a woman reporting that a man had been shot at a property on Route 16. Emergency responders pronounced the man dead at the scene, according to police. The man's body was taken to the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner's Office in Burlington. An autopsy was expected to take place Tuesday to determine the because and manner of death, police said. His identification is being withheld pending notification of relatives. Trudeau said that the investigation so far has indicated the suspicious death in Wheelock was an isolated incident. No one is in custody and the investigation is continuing. Trudeau released few other details into the investigations of both deaths. He did say they are not believed to be related to the unsolved homicide of 77-year-old Honoree Fleming, who was fatally shot on the afternoon of October 5 on a rail trail in Castleton, not far from the Vermont State University Castleton campus.",http://vtdigger.org/2023/10/17/police-probe-two-fatal-shootings-in-the-northeast-kingdom-over-two-days/,-1

The report's conclusions are based on high-quality satellite imagery of ports and train shipments. If its assessment is correct, it would appear that Vladimir Putin's ingratiating hosting of totalitarian North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on a six-day visit to Russia in mid-September, complete with a 40-second handshake, has done the trick -- worrying amounts of North Korean arms are already in the possession of Russia, and Ukraine has a problem. Dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and a little-known port in Far Eastern Russia's Primorsky Krai known as Dunai, the RUSI report revealed. And, according to the RUSI analysis, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, it said, likely contained North Korean armaments. The RUSI report also cited images showing dozens of shipping containers of the same colour and size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, bordering the Black Sea. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, the imagery is said to show. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the RUSI report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they added. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Russia has denied receiving weapons from North Korea but in September White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said US intelligence had been monitoring the potential supply of armaments from North Korea to Russia for some time. Sullivan said Moscow had made an intense effort to secure this kind of weapons support from North Korea because we have continued to squeeze... Russia's defence industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition. In a report released earlier this month, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies documented evidence indicating much increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia that likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.",https://intellinews.com/north-korean-weapons-are-pouring-into-russia-report-indicates-297275/,-1

The preliminary assessment found that the derailment preceded the bridge's collapse, the agency said, a day into federal investigators' inquiry into what caused a derailment that killed a truck driver, spilled debris across Interstate 25 and closed the highway for the foreseeable future. The broken rail was just east of the bridge over I-25, the NTSB said. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warnings systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, NTSB spokeswoman Sarah Taylor Sulick said in an email. The update comes as state officials are still seeking to determine who has responsibility for the bridge that collapsed. BSNF Railway, which operated the train and owned the line upon which it ran, said the bridge was owned by the state. The Colorado Department of Transportation initially said the bridge was owned by the railway, but a spokesman said Monday afternoon that the agency is now digging back through its records to determine who has ultimate responsibility for the 65-year-old structure.

(David ZalubowskiAssociated Press) A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said October 17, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a news release. The steel bridge built in 1958 collapsed October 15 when 30 cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away piles of coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has previously recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where the October 15 derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was under investigation. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, Sulick said. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Federal investigators late October 16 approved cleanup work along I-25 after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records October 17, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by October 18, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data that is based on reports submitted by railroads. Pressure for the industry to improve safety has grown in recent months following a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the FRA. That is just over two accidents annually on average. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit a wind energy company in Pueblo the day after the accident but postponed the trip at the last minute to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons of hot asphalt. The accident remains under investigation.",https://www.ttnews.com/articles/broken-rail-bnsf-derailment,-1

Organised and mobilised, the working class has the power to stop the warmongers. The following article was written by our comrades in Britain, offering a model motion to be passed in Trade Unions and giving an explanation of what workers can do to combat the imperialist war machine. Workers all over the world are looking on in horror as the Israeli state begins a campaign of collective punishment for the Palestinians trapped in Gaza. Having been caught off-guard by the coordinated nature of Hamas' attacks, the Zionist Israeli ruling class are now exacting a brutal revenge. Seeing this bombardment and killing of civilians, many in Britain will be asking themselves the question: what can we do to help? First of all, we must recognise that our strength lies in our collective organisation and mobilisation, especially in trade unions. If you are in a trade union, you should therefore try to get your branch to pass our model motion: declaring unequivocal solidarity with the Palestinian people; condemning the attacks by the Israeli state; and denouncing the complicity of British imperialism. Workers' action The power of the working class does not come from our decisions as consumers, but from our role as producers  Image: Socialist Appeal This motion points to the real because of the conflict: not who shot first, but who the oppressor is, and who aids them in their oppression. But more than just condemning the imperialists, the motion calls for action. We need to understand our true power: our ability to mobilise and demonstrate; and, most crucially of all, to withdraw our labour. This does not mean taking action on an individual basis - not turning up to work on Monday morning; refusing to buy this or that product - but collectively. The power of the working class does not come from our decisions as consumers, but from our role as producers. We are not customers, but workers. Whether through trade unions or otherwise, collective action by the organised working class - particularly in the industries that the capitalists rely on to keep their war machine going - can have a direct impact. Such militant mass action can hit at the imperialists directly by stopping production. The Israel Defence Forces cannot drop bombs they do not have! In this way, workers can realise the full potential of the strength that they hold in society. Even one workplace taking action can have an enormous impact on events, and inspire other workers to follow suit. Lessons from history To take one heroic example: In 1974, following Pinochet's coup in Chile, workers at the Rolls Royce factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, took action in exactly this way. After learning that the jet engines they were repairing belonged to the Chilean junta, they refused to touch these vital aircraft components. This workers' boycott went on for so long that the engines themselves rusted - rendering them impotent, and preventing their use in the murder Chilean workers thousands of miles away. Similarly, dock workers organised by the CGiL union in Genoa, Italy, went on strike in 2019 to prevent a Saudi-owned ship from loading its cargo of weapons, destined for use in the reactionary regime's war on Yemen. Just last year, Greek rail workers also attempted to prevent tanks from being transported to Ukraine for use in the conflict there. There is also a precedent in relation to workers' action to stop arms heading to Israel: most notably of all, that of the South African port workers' union SATAWU, who refused to unload an Israeli ship during the height of the state's bombardment of Gaza in 2021. In light of the latest aggression from the Israeli state, these inspiring examples provide vital lessons about how workers can and should fight the oppression of Palestinians today - by using their role in production and distribution to halt the imperialist warmongers in their tracks. Enemy at home Overthrowing our imperialist governments is ultimately what will prevent Israeli aggression and stop war for good  Image: Socialist Appeal Such a movement must also take aim at 'our own' ruling class. Netanyahu's regime is able to act with impunity because US and British imperialism see a strong Israel as vital to their interests in the Middle East. To fight such a force, we therefore need to think bigger. A campaign of workers' action against the production and transport of arms is just the start. Overthrowing our imperialist governments, the enemy at home, as well as the capitalist system they represent and defend, is ultimately what will prevent Israeli aggression and stop war for good. We cannot rely on bourgeois diplomacy and international organisations like the 'United' Nations - and other such tools of imperialism - to bring about genuine peace. The only true friends that the Palestinian masses have are the workers of the world. By smashing their own imperialist states, workers in the West can provide genuine class solidarity to the Palestinian because. That is how we can help win freedom, at long last, for the oppressed millions in the Middle East and beyond. Workers' control Beyond just halting the production and distribution of weapons, workers in the arms sector should also fight for ownership and control over the industry. In this way, taking inspiration from the Lucas Plan of the 1970s, factories and machinery could be repurposed away from arms and towards socially-useful products, such as green technologies and healthcare equipment. On this basis, as part of a socialist plan of production, society's resources and workers' skills could be utilised to benefit people and the planet, rather than the profits of the private arms manufacturers. The role of communists in the trade unions is to draw all these threads together; to raise consciousness, and provide workers with confidence and a sense of their own power; and to be the most determined class fighters and internationalists. If you want to get organised as a communist in the labour movement, join us today.",http://www.marxist.com/how-workers-can-halt-the-imperialist-war-machine.htm,-1

It is revolting and dangerous to tear people apart right now with cruel poison that undermines our basic values as Americans, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to NBC News. And no one who praises Iran-backed terrorist groups has any credibility when it comes to protecting our national security from terrorist threats. Biden, and his White House, have been in recent weeks increasingly willing to engage with Trump, who remains far and away the frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. On Monday, Trump called for a new -- and more expansive -- ban on immigrants from certain countries, and for the first time, he included Gaza. As a candidate in 2015, Trump first proposed a total shutdown on Muslims entering the YOU.S. As president, he tried to enact a sweeping executive order, which was eventually limited to five Muslim-majority countries, along with North Korea and Venezuela. Biden then rescinded that ban when he took office. Following the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, President Biden has been unequivocal: There is no place for hate in America -- not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anyone. On his very first day in office, President Biden was proud to rescind the hateful Muslim travel ban instituted by his predecessor, which violates core Americans principles, Bates said, adding, After the terrorist atrocities in Israel and after heartbreaking murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American child this week -- a 6-year-old child -- this is a moment when all leaders need to come together against hate; against Islamophobia, against antisemitism. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said it was incorrect to call it a Muslim ban and it showed how stupid the Biden people are. Truly moronic. Trump has faced significant criticism -- including from within his own party -- for his initial response to the Hamas attacks on Israel. He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and praised Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group designated by the YOU.S. as a terrorist group, as very smart. Since then, Trump has chosen a different approach, being sure to emphasize that he stands with Israel and supports a harsh approach toward Hamas and anyone who might have a whiff of support for Hamas. On Monday, Trump also said he would proactively send immigration agents to pro-jihadist demonstrations in the YOU.S. to remove noncitizens and implement strong ideological screening of all immigrants, which would include a person's rejection of Hamas. Bates said immigrants already undergo extensive vetting. There is strict national security vetting to determine whether individuals coming from anywhere in the world have ties to terrorist organizations, he said, adding that no one who praises Iran-backed terrorist groups has any credibility when it comes to protecting our national security from terrorist threats. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Within the Republican field, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has fought to outflank Trump on the right of the Israel issue, first calling for a ban on refugees from Gaza and baselessly claiming that Palestinians are all antisemitic. On Tuesday, he also said he opposed sending any humanitarian aid to Gaza.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-calls-trump-response-israel-hamas-war-revolting-dangerous-rcna120846,-1

Amazon warehouse murder suspect killed during shootout with police near I-40, MPD says A man suspected of shooting a woman to death at an Amazon warehouse in Mississippi died just hours later after getting into a shootout with Memphis Police, officials said. The deadly confrontation took place in the area of I-40 and Whitten Road around 3:20 p.m. on June 2, shortly after authorities said 45-year-old Corey Brewer shot 44-year-old Ebony Leshay Crocket three times at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake, Mississippi. Footage shows Brewer's white car surrounded by officers with guns pointed at him. He got a gun, one officer can be heard repeatedly yelling. In the video, Brewer is hardly visible behind the dark tint of the car's windshield. Gunshots begin to ring out striking the car repeatedly and shattering the car's windows. All of the officers begin backing away from the car as the shooting starts in the middle of the busy intersection. Eventually, one officers yells Hold your fire. Brewer was killed in the shootout. Horn Lake Police said that Brewer knew Crockett through their employment at Amazon. Family of Amazon worker shot and killed in Horn Lake retains civil rights attorney Ben Crump Two weeks after a woman was shot to death at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake, Mississippi, her family has retained nationally-prominent civil rights and personal injury lawyer Ben Crump, according to a press release from Crump's office. Crockett's family hired attorney Ben Crump who said that Brewer had been fired from Amazon before the deadly shooting and had a restraining order against him when he arrived at the warehouse and killed the 44-year-old woman in the parking lot as she walked to her car. The death of Ebony Crockett is tragic in a number of different ways. Ebony went through all of the appropriate avenues to protect herself from this disturbed man, only to be killed by him as she was leaving her workplace due to Amazon's lack of security measures, said a statement from Ben Crump's office after Crockett's death. Amazon, a company worth hundreds of billions of dollars, is responsible for protecting its guests from imminent danger. Ebony's killer had come on the Amazon property weeks before her death to harass her, and complaints were made to management - the warning signs were there. Why was Brewer able to come back on the property after his firing and Amazon management being notified of his continued harassment of Ebony to ultimately kill her?

The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a ban on using formaldehyde as an ingredient in hair relaxers, a huge step in raising awareness about the potential harms these products create for the many Black women that typically use them. The proposed rule would ban the chemical in hair-smoothing or hair-straightening products, also called relaxers. The FDA currently discourages consumers from using hair-straightening products that contain formaldehyde and similar ingredients, according to a fact sheet from the agency. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas that is used in a wide range of household products, including medicines and cosmetics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is highly toxic, and repeated exposure can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, lungs and throat. It is also linked to certain cancers, including myeloid leukemia, a cancer that occurs in the blood and bone marrow, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even products that do not contain formaldehyde as a main ingredient may contain other ingredients that, when heated, can be converted into formaldehyde, such as methylene glycol, which is found in some hair-straightening products. Some soaps, shampoos, lotions and cleaning products contain formalin, which is formaldehyde dissolved in water. The current law does not require the FDA to approve cosmetic products and ingredients before they go on the market -- only color additives, according to the agency's website. Companies and individuals selling products have a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of their products, the agency says, but federal law and regulations do not require companies to share their safety information with the FDA. Research in recent years has helped raise awareness about the potential dangers of using chemical hair relaxers. A study published last year by the National Institutes of Health found that women who used hair-straightening chemicals more than four times in the previous year were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the products. While the study did not collect information on specific brands or ingredients used by the participants, the researchers noted that formaldehyde, parabens and other ingredients found in chemical hair straighteners may contribute to the increased risk of uterine cancer. Additional research published this month by Boston University's Black Women's Health Study -- a long-running study, launched in 1995, that tracks the health of 59,000 Black women -- found that postmenopausal Black women who used chemical hair straighteners long term had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. The study was designed to emphasize the dangers of chemical hair straighteners and help identify safer alternatives, said Kimberly Bertrand, the study's lead author and an associate professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. We know that these products are very poorly regulated by the federal government in terms of what goes in there, Bertrand said. You cannot look at an ingredient label and know that it contains these endocrine disruptors. They do not list phthalates and parabens on the box -- they say fragrance and preservative. So, women do not really know what they are being exposed to. Endocrine disruptors are often found in chemical hair straighteners and can be absorbed into the body when the product is placed on the scalp, Bertrand said. These chemicals can interfere with the body's endocrine, or hormone, system, and are linked to early onset of puberty, fibroid tumors and infertility, she added. An additional study published by the American Journal of Epidemiology in March found that current and former use of chemical hair straighteners was associated with lower fertility in women. Several Black women within the past year have filed lawsuits against Revlon, L'oreal and other cosmetic brands, alleging that the companies' hair straightening products caused the women to develop uterine cancer, breast cancer and other health complications. In other cases, women also claimed the products caused infertility. The FDA's proposed ban comes months after Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, wrote an open letter in March requesting the federal agency to conduct an investigation to determine if chemical hair straighteners contain carcinogens that lead to a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. Many Black women use these hair straightening products to adapt to societal standards as a result of anti-Black hair sentiment, the letter stated. In addition to the FDA's proposed ban, Pressley and other advocates have pushed for policies like the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, known as the CROWN Act, which prohibits employment and educational discrimination based on hair texture. Since the YOU.S. House of Representatives passed the bill in March 2022, more than 20 states have followed suit, including Texas, where a Black teenager was suspended earlier this year after school officials said his dreadlocks violated the district's dress code. The target date for the FDA's proposed ban is April 2024.",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-proposes-ban-hair-relaxers-formaldehyde-rcna120866,-1

The main north-south highway in Colorado is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris after a weekend train derailment and bridge collapse, authorities said Tuesday. Federal investigators approved cleanup work after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed onto Interstate 25 north of Pueblo, Colorado, killing a truck driver. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, said Sarah Taylor Sulick, of the National Transportation Safety Board. The bridge, built in 1958, collapsed when 30 cars from the train derailed Sunday afternoon, the NTSB said. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials said the derailment caused the bridge collapse but have not said what caused the derailment. A preliminary report from investigators is due in several weeks. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records Tuesday, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo, of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit a wind energy company in Pueblo the day after the accident but postponed the trip at the last minute to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt.

Federal investigators approved cleanup work after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed onto Interstate 25 north of Pueblo, Colorado, killing a truck driver. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, said Sarah Taylor Sulick, of the National Transportation Safety Board. The bridge, built in 1958, collapsed when 30 cars from the train derailed Sunday afternoon, the NTSB said. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials said the derailment caused the bridge collapse but have not said what caused the derailment.

Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average.

You may opt out at any time. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed in a blast at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The exact death toll is currently unclear, with Gaza officials providing conflicting numbers ranging from 200 to 500 people. Hamas accused Israel of being behind the strike, calling it a horrific massacre. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), however, said in a statement that an initial analysis indicates the blast was from a failed rocket launched toward Israel by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a Gaza-based Islamist militant group. The conflicting claims come as Israel has ramped up attacks on Gaza in recent days ahead of a planned ground offensive. On Tuesday, Israeli strikes targeted a house in Gaza City where the family of Hamas's top political official, Ismail Haniyeh, lives, killing at least 14 people. Haniyeh himself lives in Doha, Qatar. In the war's most high-profile death thus far, an Israeli airstrike on central Gaza's Bureij refugee camp killed senior Hamas commander Ayman Nofal on Tuesday. Nofal oversaw Hamas's Central Gaza Brigade and served on its General Military Council, which helped coordinate attacks among Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other militants in the region. He was also allegedly involved in the development of weapons and the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Hamas members have two options: Either die in their positions or surrender unconditionally, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. There is no third option. We will wipe out the Hamas organization and dismantle all of its capabilities. On Tuesday, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded nearly nine hours of negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by announcing that Israel has developed a plan to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza via donor nations and multilateral organizations without benefitting Hamas. The aid deal would establish safe zones in southern Gaza and eventually help reopen the border crossing into Egypt, but it would not create a humanitarian corridor nor allow select foreigners to leave the Gaza Strip. Blinken has spent the past week conducting intense shuttle diplomacy between Israel and Arab nations in the region. And on Wednesday, YOU.S. President Joe Biden will join him in Israel to show Washington's commitment to the IDF. Biden will then visit Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II as well as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Alongside leadership visits, the YOU.S. Defense Department ordered 2,000 troops on Tuesday to be ready to deploy to the region. These forces would provide advice and medical support to the IDF and would not serve in combat roles. However, the decision of whether to deploy them has not yet been made. A 2,000-strong YOU.S. Marines rapid response force is also sailing toward the Eastern Mediterranean, according to a YOU.S. official. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier will also arrive in the Middle East in the next few days, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has extended the deployment of USS Gerald R. Ford and its warships in the region. Friendship goals. Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for the 10th annual Belt and Road Forum. During the two-day summit, Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to reaffirm Beijing's support for Moscow in its war against Ukraine and efforts to combat Western dominance. This is Putin's first visit to a country not formerly part of the Soviet Union since the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest in March. Russia and China are increasingly aligning their geopolitical ambitions to boost their sway over the world order. Both have maintained a more neutral stance on the Israel-Hamas war. And on Monday, Moscow joined Beijing in banning Japanese seafood imports, citing the release of treated and diluted radioactive wastewater into regional waters as dangerous despite scientists ensuring that the practice is safe. India's LGBTQ ruling. In a blow to LGBTQ rights in the world's most populous country, India's Supreme Court refused to legalize same-sex marriage on Tuesday. A five-justice bench said the creation of such a law should be left up to India's Parliament. However, the chief justice also stated during the ruling that queerness is a natural phenomenon and told the government to ensure the queer community is not discriminated against because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. This year, the country's top court heard 20 petitions to legalize same-sex marriage. In 2018, India's Supreme Court reversed a colonial-era law that criminalized same-sex intercourse. However, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, other discriminatory LGBTQ laws forged while under British rule have been protected, with top leaders emphasizing Hinduism's view of procreation between a man and woman as the defining status of marriage. Unauthorized meetings. Georgia's constitutional court approved the opening of impeachment proceedings against President Salome Zourabichvili on Tuesday for violating the country's constitution by making unauthorized foreign trips. In September, members of the ruling Georgian Dream party called for Zourabichvili's removal for meeting with leaders in Berlin and Brussels without government approval. Zourabichvili had hoped the visits would help Georgia obtain European Union membership. Zourabichvili condemned the ruling and said Georgian Dream is trying to kill Georgia's European future and democracy. An impeachment vote will be held in the coming days, marking the first such case in the country's history. On Monday, hundreds of EU parliamentarians and their teams en route from Brussels to Strasbourg, France, unexpectedly found themselves at the happiest place on Earth when a rail signaling error caused their train to make an unplanned 45-minute stop at the Disneyland Paris station. Their constituents can rest assured, though; the hardworking politicians somehow managed to resist the temptation to take a quick ride on Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain or Peter Pan's Flight during the brief delay.

Those are the cases of Latoris Taylor, Corey Brewer and Melissa Horton. In all three of those cases we had previously declined to bring a prosecution against those officers, Mulroy said, but the release of the redacted video is in accordance with a new policy to release footage of fatal shootings sooner. During Tuesday's news conference, Mulroy also announced that no charges would be filed in the death of Jarveon Hudspeth. Videos from the three other cases were posted online at the Shelby County District Attorney's website after the news conference Tuesday. Here are details of each shooting and what the videos show. Horton, 43, was killed on March 18 in Bartlett. Two deputies from the Shelby County Sheriff's Office pulled over her vehicle after learning from the Fayette County Sheriff's Office that she had attempted to shoot her fianc. When the deputies commanded Horton to exit the car, she lifted a shotgun and pointed it at one of the deputies. The deputies fired, killing Horton. Video from body-worn cameras and a dash camera shows a sheriff's vehicle blocking off Horton's vehicle, then two officers approaching her car, with one banging on her vehicle's door while yelling get the (expletive) out the truck! A moment later, an officer yells something about a shotgun and the two officers back away from the car while firing multiple shots. Taylor, 40, was killed on December 9 in the Westwood neighborhood of Memphis. According to a news release from the Shelby County District Attorney's Office, he was seen in a stolen car and ran as a Memphis police officer approached in his patrol car. That officer chased Taylor on foot, during which Taylor turned and fired two shots at the officer, who returned fire, killing Taylor, according to the news release. Officer body-camera video shows an officer exiting his vehicle, running, then firing several shots. Video from a security camera in the neighborhood shows a man running, firing at someone behind him, then dropping to the ground in a front yard, presumably shot. A large number of officers quickly arrive on the scene and approach the man. Brewer, 45, was killed June 3, 2022 at Interstate 40 and Whitten. He was wanted in connection with a fatal shooting of a woman earlier that day at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake. After stopping the car, Brewer pointed his gun at an officer and four Memphis police officers returned fire. More: Ex-Memphis police officers say Tyre Nichols' mother has no standing to sue, ask to dismiss Redacted videos from several body-worn cameras and the dash camera from one police vehicle show that officers chased Brewer by car, forcing his white vehicle to pull over and surrounding it.

The situation at the Rafah crossing was growing increasingly desperate as massive civilian crowds were still under threat of falling bombs while unable to access convoys of water, food, hygiene items, blankets, tents, and medical supplies sitting unused in neighboring Egypt, according the United Nations. The border crossing with Egypt has been shuttered since October 7, when Hamas launched a barrage of coordinated attacks on Israel, whose military responded in an all-out siege on the Gaza Strip. After a week of fighting, tons of essential goods poured into Egypt's El Arish International Airport over the weekend from Jordan, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, before being shipped to Gaza aboard hundreds of big rigs. The World Health Organization sent medical supplies from a hub in Dubai to help those injured in the crossfire, as well as those suffering from trauma or persistent health conditions like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The YOU.N. World Food Program was also delivering food and water to Gaza, which had no fuel, electricity and limited access to clean drinking water as Israel's bombing campaign continued to pummel major population centers, reducing them to rubble. Previously, YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Israel to open a safe aid delivery corridor as Gaza was running out of basic supplies to support life. On Tuesday, Tamara Alrifai, who serves as the spokesperson for the YOU.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, urged Israel to reopen the border crossing to allow the crowds to reach the desperately needed aid. In one episode, about 6,000 civilian refugees were huddled in a warehouse in southern Gaza with little if anything to eat or drink, she told CNBC. Over the last two days, reports of about 1 million people -- that is a sea of people -- going south moved using whatever means they could and given the lack of fuel in Gaza a lot of them moved by feet, Alrifai said. So, the images we have been receiving from my colleagues are harrowing images of people on their feet walking under airstrikes and air bombings to try to find shelter in a safer area. Over the weekend, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Rafah border crossing would be reopened as Israel initiated a ground invasion into the Palestinian enclave, where more than 2 million civilians were trapped in a worsening humanitarian crisis. However, discussions to resolve the matter broke down Monday after Egypt's leadership refused to open their side of the crossing unless Israel let the waiting supplies into Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced pressure from Washington to allow humanitarian aid to come into Gaza as water and other supplies were starting to run out. But Netanyahu's office said Monday that Israel had received no assurances from Hamas on a cease-fire agreement that would allow the aid into Gaza and the refugees to seek safer ground in Egypt. Meanwhile, Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry blamed Israel for delaying the move and putting innocent lives at risk.",https://news.yahoo.com/palestinian-refugees-remain-cut-off-150128497.html,-1

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit vital military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear programme. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The US unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a US aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the spectre of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a US plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The US has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in the production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defence ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments have been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

In a divided decision, the majority acknowledged that the Arizona Constitution bars lawmakers from limiting someone is right to sue. Yet, a 1986 law limiting the ability of victims of drunk drivers to sue the bartenders who overserved them does precisely that. Chief Justice Robert Brutinel, however, said that prohibition applies only to legal claims that existed in 1912 when the state constitution was adopted. And he said the concept of suing those who serve liquor for the accidents they because -- known as dram shop liability -- was only created in 1983 by a decision of the high court.

It seeks compensation from a liquor licensee who creates a dangerous situation by overserving an already intoxicated patron who then drives and injures or kills someone. Timmer said if someone can prove the elements -- including that the owner of the tavern knew or should have known the person was drunk -- there is no reason to shield them from the duty they owe to everyone else on the road. She also predicted fallout, saying that a ruling that there is no constitutional right to sue in these cases eliminates an important, powerful, and longstanding deterrent to businesses pushing last-call pre-closing alcoholic drinks on patrons who have yet to appear intoxicated and are about to leave and get behind the wheel. The case involves JAI Dining Services, the owners of Jaguars Club in Phoenix. Cesar Villanueva, kicked out after being drunk, went home, fell asleep for a short time before getting up to take a friend home. It was during that second trip he ran his truck into a vehicle stopped at a red light and killed two people. He was subsequently convicted of two counts of manslaughter and was sentenced to prison. The survivors sued JAI under the theory, first announced by the Supreme Court in a landmark 1983 ruling, that establishments that serve alcohol to someone who is intoxicated can be held liable for the damages that person causes.

Lawmakers did agree to preserve liability -- but only when a liquor licensee serves someone who is obviously intoxicated. That is defined in statute as being drunk to such an extent that the person's physical abilities are substantially impaired as shown by significantly uncoordinated physical action or dysfunction that would have been obvious to a reasonable person. More to the point, though, they immunized the actions of bartenders and others who serve alcoholic beverages to patrons if there was not this obvious intoxication. David Abney, representing the survivors, argued to the Supreme Court that provision of the 1986 law is unconstitutional. It all comes down to the section of the Arizona Constitution, adopted at statehood, which says, the right of action to recover damages for injuries shall never be abrogated, and the amount recovered shall not be subject to any statutory limitation. Put simply, what is known as the anti-abrogation clause bars lawmakers from eliminating someone is right to sue for financial recompense. In the new ruling, however, Brutinel said that constitutional protection applies only to the kinds of lawsuits that could be filed in 1912. And at that time, the premise was that the negligent act -- the because of the accident -- was drinking, not the selling of it by someone else. What that means, said Brutinel, is that there was no right in 1912 to sue someone for serving a customer they knew or should have known was intoxicated. And that right did not exist until the Supreme Court created it in 1983. And what that also means, said the chief justice, is that lawmakers were free to decide three years later to partly overturn that ruling and declare that bartender liability is limited solely to cases where there is evidence of obvious intoxication. That means no liability when the claim of a survivor is only that the bartender or server knew or should have known the person was drunk. Timmer chided the other justices for limiting the scope of the amendment, saying the new ruling undermines exactly why it was inserted into the Arizona Constitution. The progressive-minded framers, who made up the majority of the constitutional convention, included it as part of a platform aimed, in part, at recognizing individual freedoms and protecting them from interference by a government heavily influenced by powerful private interests, she wrote. Timmer also pointed out that foes of the anti-abrogation clause tried three times -- in 1986, 1990 and 1994 -- to get voters to alter or repeal it. Each time, it failed.

Morganton police had no information regarding how the convicts escaped, but both were reported to be armed and dangerous. Officers said the two men are reported to have arrived at the store on foot and robbed Pep Mull and Jimmy Powell of about 1,000. One of the suspects was wearing a stocking over his head. One was allegedly armed with a .38 caliber pistol, and the other with a .22 caliber pistol. The robbers are believed to have fled on foot into the area behind the water filtering plant after the incident. Officers and bloodhounds gave chase, and in the early hours of the morning were still following the suspects. The intensive search is concentrated in the Emorywood section of the county, in the Yellow Mountain Road area. People are also reading...

Dr. Charles Weaver, superintendent of Burke County Public Schools, made that comment this morning as he prepared to give a statement of fair warning that those making bomb threats will go to court. That this is no idle threat was apparent on Tuesday in District Court, when Judge Marshall Cline of Lenoir dealt with the Sept. 25 case involving a call to Salem School. For making a bomb threat, the 17-year-old defendant received a 24-month suspended sentence, was placed on probation for five years and fined 1,000 and costs of court. Another defendant, charged with aiding and abetting a bomb threat, was taken as nol pros with leave (meaning the prosecutor elected to drop a pending criminal charge). This decision was made based on evidence that the aiding and abetting suspect had joined the primary defendant in watching the school evacuation, but was not with him at the time the call was made. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio Someone called in a bomb threat to Freedom High on Monday around 10:30 a.m. Students were evacuated and stood outside for about three hours while the school was searched. An additional bomb threat for Freedom was called into the school's administrative office this morning. W.F. McIntosh, assistant principal, said a number of students have asked him what they can do to help catch those making threats. One student suggested starting a reward fund for the apprehension and conviction of the person causing the disruption. Alert man may have prevented train wreck (Wednesday, October 17, 1973) Not many people walk three miles to work along a railroad track at 5 a.m., but Wilby Bumgarner does. Not many people get the opportunity of saving a train from wrecking, but Bumgarner may have. While walking to his job at the Alba Plant at Alba Waldensian in Valdese at 5 a.m. on Monday, Bumgarner saw a piece of iron lying on the crossties between two rails on the railroad track. He also saw that a joint in the rail to his left was loose and understood where the piece of iron came from. The piece of iron was one of three angle bars that hold two rails together where a switch track connects to the main line of the railroad. He then saw another angle bar lying on the gravel on the left side of the track and pieces of huge, broken bolts lying on both sides of the rail. Realizing this situation could potentially because a train passing through to derail and plunge down one of the 40- to 50-foot drop-offs on either side of the tracks, Bumgarner ran to the Valdese train depot to report the matter, but there was no one there. He instead told officers at the Valdese Police Department, who contacted the proper authorities to have the issue resolved. The damaged track was repaired that same day. Burke opposes liquor plan (Wednesday, October 17, 1973) According to a thorough survey conducted by The News Herald, Burke County residents intend to vote by an overwhelming majority of nearly four-to-one against selling liquor by the drink. The results of the telephone poll indicate that the mixed beverage plan, which will be voted on statewide in the November 6 election, is firmly opposed by every major segment of the Burke County population -- men and women, blue-collar and white-collar workers, Morgantonians and those who live outside city limits. The survey was made Sunday afternoon by calling telephone numbers picked at random from the directory. Hundreds of calls were made to produce 100 definite responses. Only those who identified themselves as registered voters were questioned, and only a handful of those indicated that they were undecided. Undecided responses were disregarded. All were told that their names would not be used, in an effort to make the results as accurate as possible. Reasons given for disapproval of the mixed beverage plan focused mainly on a general opposition to drinking alcohol and the potential effect the measure could have on the next generation if it passed.

In Little Palestine, near Chicago, immigration lawyer Fidaa Elaydi says she cannot get any work done. I have not really cooked a proper meal in, like, a week, said Elaydi. Instead, she is been glued to the news since the recent surprise attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza, and constantly calling the hundreds of family members she has across the Gaza Strip. Elaydi says she cannot get ahold of her relatives in Gaza City. And she is terrified about what that could mean. Yesterday, I had to call a friend and, you know, share my condolences with him after 45 members of his family were killed in a single air strike, said Elaydi. A few miles south of Gaza City, she says the home of her cousin's neighbor was bombed over the weekend. I feel powerless. I am frustrated. I am angry. I am enraged, she said. In addition to spending every waking hour worrying about Gaza, Elyadi is also scared for her family in the Chicago suburbs after the tragic death of a local 6-year-oldPalestinian American boy who was stabbed to death on Saturday in what police are calling a hate crime directly in response to the war in Gaza. In the eyes of the public, Palestinians are less human than anyone else, Elyadi said. At a pro-Palestinian rally in downtown Chicago last week, Elyadi says someone from a nearby high rise threw an egg at her. For the first time in her life, she says she feels unsafe at home. In the YOU.S., Elyadi is urging elected officials and the media to recognize the humanity of all Muslim Americans. And in Gaza, she is calling for an immediate cease-fire and a humanitarian corridor before it is too late for her relatives. I think we can all agree and unify behind a message like that, that people should have access to food and water and electricity and that the injured should be able to receive treatment, she said.

The warehouse, at 100,569 square feet, is proposed to be built on nearly 22 acres at 7503 Kernsville Road and developed by Core5 Industrial Partners, which also has industrial properties in Berks and Monroe counties. The township previously rejected this and two other warehouse proposals, and all three have since gone to court to appeal the decisions. The DEP hearing will take place at 6 p.m. October 25 at the Germansville Volunteer Fire Company, 6011 Memorial Road. The hearing will consider Core5's February application for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to allow the discharge of stormwater from the construction area into Cherith Brook, a tributary to Jordan Creek.

But, for wildlife in the hot deserts of Arizona, finding it is not so easy. That is where water catchments come in. Water catchments are systems that collect rainwater and use it to fill a drinking hole for desert-dwelling animals -- from honeybees to bighorn sheep. According to the Arizona Game and Fish Department, there are roughly 3,000 catchments across Arizona. A catchment looks like a large tin roof on the ground, with one side at a slight incline, known as an apron. Along the lowest side of the apron is a gutter, which feeds any water caught into large tanks below the tin apron. Water stored in the underground tanks then feeds into and automatically refills a small drinking hole nearby, which looks like a cement hole with a side ramp for smaller animals to take a drink.

Joseph Currie, habitat planning program manager with Arizona Game and Fish, said 2023 was different from past years. This summer was not as bad for us, for hauling water, and the only reason was because we had that really wet and cool winter and spring, Currie said, noting many of the catchments filled up naturally. We did not haul nearly as much as like a couple years ago, where we had a really bad winter and a really bad summer. Currie said Arizona Game and Fish hauled an estimated 1 million gallons of water this year. During drier years, the agency has hauled up to 2.6 million gallons. Currie said wildlife used water catchments heavily throughout July and August, when Arizona saw record-breaking temperatures. Our summers are super hot and dry, and populations will fluctuate and die off drastically if we are not able to give them a stable source of water, because water is the most important thing in life, Currie said. Nate Solmon, habitat construction field crew supervisor with Arizona Game and Fish, said where the water comes from varies and can include places such as fire departments close to the catchment sites. The hardest part is figuring out the logistics and then also where we are going to get the water from, Solmon said, noting locations can range from further north in Arizona to close to the border. Solmon's team that fills the catchments runs on an eight-day-long shift, keeping their gear in the truck and camping near places where catchments may need to be filled. Arizona Game and Fish uses an electronic frequency system to measure the water levels of the catchments, which sends alerts to Game and Fish officials when the levels get too low. Some days, Solmon's team drives the water truck up to the site, empties the water tank onto the catchment apron and then waits for the next call. However, for places too difficult to reach using just the water truck, it could require the help of a helicopter. We will truck water out, we have to find a staging area - we have to try to get as close to the catchment as we can because obviously helicopters are really expensive, Solmon said of the process with helicopter support. The helicopter then picks up a large tank of water and dumps it onto the apron. Depending on the temperature, local wildlife and catchment system, Solmon's team could be taking trips to a specific catchment every four to six weeks. Arizona Game and Fish currently builds one or two new catchments each year but is primarily focusing on making existing catchments self-sustaining. Subscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

ALBAWABA- In a tragic incident, dozens have been killed and wounded in a massive explosion in Yemen's northern city of Amran. Local sources from the Jabal Yazid directorate in the Amran governorate reported the casualties this evening as a result of an explosion in an ammunition warehouse in one of the villages in the directorate. The blast occurred at sunset in an ammunition storage facility located at the residence of a weapons dealer in the village of Beit Saylan, Jabal Yazid directorate. Initial assessments suggest that the explosion may have been caused by improper storage practices. Preliminary statistics indicate that the explosion led to the death of 14 individuals and the injury of 60 others among the local residents. The residence of the well-known arms dealer, Mohammed Ahmed Saylan, was entirely destroyed, along with four other houses, while 16 adjacent houses suffered partial collapse. The gravity of the situation is further emphasized by activists on social media who have shared images and video clips capturing the explosion's aftermath and the evident state of panic and terror experienced by the residents.",https://www.albawaba.com/news/dozens-killed-and-injured-massive-explosion-yemens-amran-city-1538122,-1

The main north-south highway in Colorado is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris after a weekend train derailment and bridge collapse, authorities said Tuesday. Federal investigators approved cleanup work after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed onto Interstate 25 north of Pueblo, Colorado, killing a truck driver. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, said Sarah Taylor Sulick, of the National Transportation Safety Board. The bridge, built in 1958, collapsed when 30 cars from the train derailed Sunday afternoon, the NTSB said. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials said the derailment caused the bridge collapse but have not said what caused the derailment. A preliminary report from investigators is due in several weeks. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records Tuesday, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo, of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit a wind energy company in Pueblo the day after the accident but postponed the trip at the last minute to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt.

Since global shipping peaked during the Covid pandemic, A.P. Moller-Maersk has warned about an emerging downturn in the container shipping market. Goldman now forecasts a lengthier and potentially more severe downturn for the shipping industry, recommending a sell for the Danish shipping giant: We believe market expectations are still too complacent on the depth and duration of the coming shipping recession, Goldman analyst Patrick Creuset told clients Monday morning. Creuset said his fundamental perspective on the industry is that freight rates and earnings must continue to decline. This reduction is necessary until there is enough financial pressure to phase out expensive tonnage. He said, Even after the further rate drop in recent weeks, we see no sign of this: New vessel deliveries are running at c.1 of the global fleetmonth with very little slippage, idling and scrapping remain low, and Nov active capacity is set to increase significantly vs. Oct on the main trades. Creuset identified two major distinctions compared with previous bear markets, which might result in a steeper drop in EBIT margin than typically observed: Goldman hit Maersk with a sell rating, expecting 2023-27 EBITDA estimates fall by 8 on average, reflecting lower freight rates. The analyst shows carriers are still ordering new vessels, indicating the industry needs more tools to manage capacity. Container rates on major shipping lines have roundtripped back to pre-Covid levels. In August, Maersk warned about waning global demand for shipping containers by sea. The company transports Chinese-made goods for retailers such as Walmart, Nordstrom, Macy's, and Kohl's - all of whom have warned about a consumer slowdown.",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldmans-Grim-Forecast-Shipping-Industry-Faces-Prolonged-Downturn.html,-1

The Pancakes  Booze Art Show, known for offering all-you-can-eat-pancakes alongside loads of artwork, is a one-day pop-up gallery coming to Tucson on Saturday, October 21. Kirlin was born and raised in Tucson, attending Pima Community College after the school launched a two-year film program. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he worked in film for a dozen or so years. As I got a little bit older, as hard as I worked to get into that industry, I was not living a lifestyle that I wanted, he says. I had this grand idea to rent a warehouse space and open a small photography-slash-production space -- and it was failing miserably. I needed to find a way to make some money with the space because I had a huge overhead. People are also reading...

What was once a photography and production studio for Kirlin turned into an underground art gallery. At that time, this was 15 years ago, most art shows were free and you would go and it would be one of those wine-and-cheese types of events, he says. Most of the artists he knew were young -- he did not want to take a commission from them, but he knew he needed to make money. Then it hit him: pancakes. If he offered something like all-you-can-eat pancakes, he could justify charging an admission fee to gallery attendees. And it worked. It was a hit from the very first time we did it. It kind of caught the art community in LA, he says. It turned into a couple hundred people to 500 people to a thousand. Once I knew I had something, I started doing it in different cities. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio He is since brought the show to cities across the YOU.S., from Atlanta to Austin to Detroit to Honolulu. Before the pandemic hit, he had taken the show overseas to London, Paris and Berlin. After a long 14 years, Kirlin has never brought the show to Tucson -- until now. For me, when I was younger, I wanted to get out of Tucson so bad. I was like, I got to get out of here, I got to explore the world, he says. I really love Tucson now that I am a bit older, but when I was younger I wanted to get out. He still has family and friends here and he finally found the perfect venue -- The Whistle Stop Depot, 127 W. Fifth St. It was time to bring Pancakes  Booze to Tucson. The show will feature close to 100 artists, from paintings and photography hanging on the walls to vendors selling fashion, candles and jewelry. That is what is kind of fun about it -- it is a very welcoming atmosphere for artists so we have everything from seasoned experienced artists you might see in a fine art gallery, and then we have people who have never shown their artwork before who are maybe experimenting with their career, Kirlin says. There will be all-you-can-eat pancakes, of course, plus a DJ and a cash bar. You can also watch live painting -- both on canvases and on bodies. Tickets are on sale here, ranging from 10-20. The show starts at 8 p.m. and is for ages 21 and up. It is kind of like the antithesis of a snobby pretentious wine-and-art show, he says. It is the total opposite. We pride our event on that.

Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in a news release. The steel bridge built in 1958 collapsed Sunday, October 15 when 30 cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over I-25. The 60-year-old driver of a semi truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25 is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away piles of coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has previously recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was under investigation.

Images and video released by the Colorado State Patrol show a semitrailer crushed under the bridge and more than a dozen derailed train cars that spilled coal across the highway. Two sets of train car wheels can be seen among the coal. BNSF, the train operator, said no injuries were reported among the crew. The railroad said it was working with authorities to investigate and clean up the site. State Patrol spokesman Gabriel Moltrer said the truck driver was fatally injured. The Pueblo County coroner's office has not released the driver's name. A stretch of the interstate, which runs north-south through Colorado via Denver, remained closed in both directions Monday. The section of highway carries about 40,000 vehicles daily. This will be an extended closure, the Colorado Department of Transportation said in a bulletin for drivers. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the derailment, with a team expected to arrive at the scene Monday. Sarah Taylor Sulick, an NTSB spokeswoman, said the investigation also will examine the bridge and its maintenance. The bridge's ownership on Monday was not clear. The state Transportation Department said it is owned by BNSF, but the railroad said it is owned by the state agency. The crossing is listed in state bridge records that do not indicate ownership. The records rank its condition as poor, a designation that does not necessarily indicate a safety risk. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday he talked to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) about the derailment, adding that officials from his federal agency were on their way to the scene. BNSF has had 177 derailments this year, according to Federal Railroad Administration data. Most accidents recorded by the FRA occur in rail yards rather than on mainlines. Also Monday, the NTSB released findings from a BNSF derailment in Raymond, Minn., this year that led to 800 people being evacuated because some of the derailed cars were carrying ethanol. Investigators found that five tank cars released hazardous materials. The March 30 derailment was caused by a broken rail, the NTSB concluded. The safety of freight railroads has been under scrutiny this year following the February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. In that case, a Norfolk Southern train came off the tracks, and officials decided to vent and burn cars carrying vinyl chloride. Black smoke billowed over the community, leaving residents concerned about their health. The Ohio derailment, which is still under investigation by the NTSB, prompted the FRA to push for stronger railroad regulations as lawmakers also vowed to make changes to safety laws. A Senate committee approved a bill in May, but it has not come up for a vote on the Senate floor. Legislation has not moved forward in the House.",https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/national_world/wapo/trucker-dies-when-colorado-bridge-carrying-coal-train-collapses-on-i-25/article_6a24ffc8-79eb-5a28-a563-966242ca4964.html,-1

Due to this, the work of the flyover is getting delayed, Ajay Vaise, executive engineer, PMC, told Mirror. Sources in the civic body said the flyover project cost is escalating by Rs 1 crore per month due to the delay in submission of the report by the rail authorities. MahaMetro executive director Hemant Sonawane refuted the claims. We have submitted reports on the design of 12 out of 39 pillars to the PMC. The reports on the design of other pillars will be submitted in a phased manner. We are cooperating with the civic body, he told Mirror. The sources in the civic body said: Metro poles up to a height of one meter from the ground will be constructed on the routes where the flyover ends. On November 21 last year, the PMC had requested for the plan from MahaMetro as to where and how these pillars would be. After repeated follow-up, a report on the design of these pillars was given in the beginning of September this year, the sources in the civic body said. A joint meeting of PMC and MahaMetro officials was held on September 27. At that time, it came to light that the report on the structure of the pillars submitted by metro authorities was given without underground investigation. Since then, the civic body has been following up for the revised report. The construction of the flyover is being delayed due to a lack of roads to the landing site of the flyover. The material for the flyover construction is currently being taken to the bridge with the help of a lift. The flyover is scheduled for completion by March 2024, and the work is being done at 80 percent capacity, claimed the officials.",https://punemirror.com/pune/civic/absence-of-report-on-metro-pillars-delaying-pmc-s-flyover-work/cid1697579555.htm,-1

The steel bridge built in 1958 collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25 is the main north-south route through Colorado. It is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris from the site. Federal investigators approved cleanup work after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, said Sarah Taylor Sulick, of the National Transportation Safety Board, which released the preliminary findings Tuesday.

Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state.

2023-10-17 15:01:08.126,2023-10-123046877,warehouse_fire,52d8fd3f-0f55-4e78-af69-fdb8549a289f,'The algorithm fired me': California bill takes on Amazon's notorious work culture,"An Assembly-passed bill is expected to reach the Senate floor this week or next to crack down on the opaque, algorithm-led and harsh warehouse work conditions often attributed to the Seattle technology behemoth. The bill, the first such legislation in the nation, would require warehouses to disclose quotas and work speed metrics to employees and government agencies. It would ban time off task penalties that affect health and safety, including bathroom use, and prohibit retaliation against workers who complain. Amazon dominates online shopping across the nation amid a surge in e-commerce fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. With 950,000 YOU.S. employees and 368 billion in revenue in 2020, it is the nation's second-largest employer after Walmart, and is under growing pressure to address worker injuries in its supply chain. Amazon has set the pace, creating a market for next-day delivery of consumer goods, said Assembly member Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), the bill's author. We see Walmart and other large warehouses following suit. We need to make sure our laws catch up with that. California's workplace laws often influence other states and the federal government, experts say. The state Senate vote on the bill, AB 701, is expected to be close, amid heavy opposition from retailers and other industries. Scholars see broad implications for the future of work. In the YOU.S., we are at an inflection point on the question of how technologies are used in workplaces and what rights workers have to data collected about them, said Beth Gutelius, research director at the University of Illinois at Chicago's Center for Urban Economic Development and an authority on logistics. Warehouses are where the dark sides of work surveillance are being revealed. In analyzing the legislation, the Senate Judiciary Committee cited studies showing Amazon's injury rate to be nearly twice that of the warehouse industry generally. One study compared Amazon's 2020 injury rate (6.5 injuries for every 100 workers) to Walmart's (three injuries). Amazon, at least, may have made the market-based decision that avoiding workplace injuries is more costly than maintaining the delivery speeds for which it is famous, the committee suggested. Amazon and Walmart declined to comment on the legislation or to answer questions on their respective injury rates. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty wrote in an email: Like most companies, we have performance expectations for every employee, and we measure actual performance. Amazon offers coaching to workers who do not meet targets, she said. The truth is, terminations for performance issues are rare -- less than 1. The health and safety of our employees is our No. 1 priority. In a letter to shareholders in April, Chief Executive Jeff Bezos wrote, We need to do a better job for our employees. News reports portraying them as desperate souls and treated like robots are inaccurate, he asserted. To address employees' sprains and strains from repetitive motions and prevent forklift and other industrial vehicle collisions, he wrote, Amazon will invest more than 300 million in safety projects this year. Consumer demand is fueling rapid growth in warehouse work. In California, where imports from Asia flow through the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland to giant distribution centers, 209,700 warehouse workers were employed in July, nearly double the number five years ago. The Inland Empire, spanning Riverside and San Bernardino counties, is the nation's biggest warehouse center. Amazon is the region's largest employer, with an estimated 40,000 logistics workers. The state legislation ratchets up the pressure Amazon already faces from an energized labor movement. The company crushed a campaign in April to unionize 6,000 workers at one of its warehouses in Alabama. In June, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced a nationwide push to organize Amazon's delivery and warehouse employees, calling the company an existential threat to workers across the logistics industry. Chanel Hawkes, 33, lost her job at a call center when her company closed during the pandemic. Amazon was the only company that was hiring and thriving, she said. At Amazon's Eastvale complex with 6,000 employees, she packed boxes of mouthwash, books and toys from 6 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. four or five days a week. She earned 15 an hour. I like a challenge, she said. But it was like sprinting on your feet for 10 hours. Soon, she felt intense pain in her wrist. Her supervisors, she said, told her to eat more protein, do wrist stretches and get back to work. Warehouse computers, which she checked three times a day, told her to make a rate of 70 to 80, a speed measure she said was never explained -- and which Amazon declines to define publicly. She was working at a rate of only 50 to 60. Hawkes asked for an easier job, telling supervisors my nerves are hurting. It did not happen. She was not referred to workers' compensation doctors, she said. And in March, after seven months, she was terminated. Now she cannot drive or push a grocery cart without feeling pain, she said. An art major in community college, she wonders when she will be able to paint again in her spare time. I was just a working woman, Hawkes said. Especially being African American, I did not know how to fight a big system. Amazon did not respond to questions about Hawkes' experience. Race is part of the debate over AB 701. Latino and Black employees constitute 66 of warehouse staff, although workers of color account for just 37 of the total YOU.S. labor force, according to a UC Berkeley study. These backbreaking conditions have significant implications for communities of color, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and other bill supporters wrote lawmakers this summer. Many ... feel they must accept unsafe conditions to keep a roof over their heads. They are least likely to have adequate health insurance or any safety net. Yesenia Barrera, a former Amazon worker in Rialto, told an Assembly committee, We are carrying, bending, reaching, twisting and packing items from 30 to 60 pounds for hours a day with no proper rest time. After just one warning, she said, The algorithm fired me, and other workers like me, though we were working as hard as we could. Barrera, 22, has since gone to work as an organizer for the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a foundation-funded nonprofit in Ontario that is backing AB 701. Workplace quotas have been around for centuries, said Sheheryar Kaoosji, the center's executive director. We have seen high injury rates at Walmart too. But Amazon makes it much more burdensome with surveillance. Other companies would love to do what Amazon does -- wire their facilities wall to wall. California's general ergonomic standard is weak and rarely enforced, he said. At unionized warehouses, covering roughly 10 of workers, safety issues are bargained with management, but at Amazon and other nonunion facilities, workers have no recourse, and they just feel lucky to have a job, Kaoosji said. In a class-action lawsuit that Amazon settled in December, Trevion Sherman and 26 other California plaintiffs described how the company's production clock does not stop when employees need to use the restroom so they went without bathroom breaks for fear of termination. Amazon declined to reveal the terms of the settlement. A coalition of industries led by the California Chamber of Commerce has spent months lobbying against AB 701. Productivity standards are not inherently punitive, the group wrote lawmakers August 3. Nonetheless, after several clarifications to the bill, the chamber softened its opposition, removing it from its annual job killer list -- a tag that often dooms legislation. In further compromises last week, backers amended the measure to cut out a requirement for CalOSHA, the state's workplace safety agency, to adopt a warehouse-specific injury rule. Backers said the bill remains strong because it steps up enforcement by the state labor commissioner. New language also exempts farm facilities to prevent spoilage before shipping. Republican lawmakers continue to oppose the legislation, saying it will raise consumer prices and burden companies with litigation. Sen. Brian Jones (R-Santee) called it part of a campaign to tip the scales to coerce employees to unionize, noting that AB 701 is backed by the Teamsters. Democrats, he said, should not be trusted to micromanage private warehouses. Amazon points to benefits that nonunion warehouses do not always offer, such as health insurance from the first day of employment. That is what drew Nathan Morin, 33, to work in an Amazon warehouse in Redlands for three years as a packer, forklift driver and truck loader until December. He did not have health insurance and was able to immediately sign on to a plan through Kaiser Permanente. Another benefit was Amazon's policy of adjusting his schedule to fit around his college classes while he was a student at Cal Poly Pomona. From the first day, Amazon said it is a very physical job, but they never told us about the quotas, he recalled. You were allowed 30 minutes 'time off task' a week. But the bathrooms are at the far ends of the warehouse. If you took 10 minutes to go once a day when you were not on break, you would be written up at the end of the week. Morin's packing quota was at least 70 items an hour during Amazon's peak seasons. Cameras were at workstations, in break rooms, in locker rooms, he said. Devices would flag managers if you took 'time off task.' It was dehumanizing. Morin said he saw about a dozen workers get injured, including a woman who was told by an Amazon workers' comp doctor that she had pulled a muscle only to find out later, she reported, that she had fractured her knee. To this day, she cannot walk right, Morin said. At one point, Morin worked as a learning ambassador coaching struggling workers with tips to avoid a write-up. If injured employees were granted accommodations with lower-stress tasks, It was like two weeks and then you were expected to go back to work, he said. You hoped they could work faster, he said. Otherwise, it was termination. Amazon did not respond to questions about Morin's experiences. Looking back, Morin said: I do not want to think Amazon deliberately injures people. It is a product of the work culture -- getting things done as quickly as possible.",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-31/la-fi-amazon-warehouse-injuries-ab701-bill-calosha,-1

In the Inland Empire, which came first: orange trees or railroads? Orange trees, by about a decade: 1870s compared to 1880s. But groves of citrus trees might not have blanketed the landscape if not for the trains that brought consumers here to live and that shipped the product to consumers elsewhere. And both industries rose and then fell in tandem, with citrus and railroads both fading after World War II as groves were ripped out for housing and passenger rail gave way to freeways. Ben Jenkins, an associate professor of history at the University of La Verne, studies the twin forces. In June he produced a book titled Octopus's Garden: How Railroads and Citrus Transformed Southern California. Why Octopus's Garden? Railroads were such a political force by the early 20th century, their tentacles everywhere, that critics derided them as the Octopus. Citrus trees were a garden of sorts. But Octopus's Garden is also, of course, a Beatles reference. Jenkins jokes in the introduction about his debt to, ahem, master lyricist Ringo Starr. (This is yet more evidence, by the way, that every topic in this space is connected somehow.) There was a commercial synergy between transportation and agriculture, Jenkins writes. Packing houses were built next to rail lines. Refrigerated train cars were developed -- and somewhat hilariously nicknamed reefers -- to keep Southern California produce fresh during transport. Excursion trains from L.A. traveled through foothill cities like Claremont and Upland out to San Bernardino, Highland and Redlands before heading to Riverside and Corona, a looping route called the kite-shaped track. A vintage postcard image in Jenkins' book depicts a train chugging through a grove, with workers on ladders picking fruit just yards away. A passenger might have been able to grab an orange off a tree through the train window. Union Pacific, Santa Fe and the Pacific Electric all had excursions to Riverside, Redlands and San Bernardino, Jenkins told me. 'Come see the Orange Empire and pick an orange.' If you are in L.A. and you have time to kill, it was something to do. I am reminded of the I Love Lucy episode in which the New York City characters take a vacation to Hollywood. Fred famously vows to go into orange farming after he and Ethel take a train through Pomona. Riverside and the rest of the Inland Empire were full of gentleman farmers who owned a few acres, planted citrus and, because they had day jobs, left much of the hard labor to others. Generally only the well-heeled could start a grove. From planting seeds to the first harvest might take seven years, all without income. Once the money started rolling in, though, groves were very profitable. In 1895, Riverside had the highest per-capita income in the United States. There was something romantic about owning a grove. It was like a back-to-the-land movement decades before Green Acres or Woodstock. But the reality was less pastoral. Chinese workers died building the railroads. Mexican American, Japanese American and Indigenous fruit pickers did strenuous outdoor work -- going up and down ladders, being exposed to sun and pesticides, getting pricked by thorns -- for poor wages. If they tried to organize, they were harassed or beaten. Women wrapped fruit in packing houses on assembly lines. And trying to keep groves from freezing on cold nights involved lighting oil burners to throw out warm smoke. That also sent soot drifting over entire cities and into kitchens, and probably into workers' lungs. Between smudge pots, trucks, trains and conveyor belts, the citrus industry was more mechanized and less Edenic than popular imagination might have it. Jenkins calls the result an industrialized countryside. Railroads and citrus, he concludes, were beneficial and harmful in equal measure. Yet when I asked him what Southern California might have been like without either industry, he replied: Economically stagnant. ... It is hard for me to imagine Southern California without them. Jenkins, an Inland Empire native who lives in Upland, was born too late -- he is 34 -- to experience any of this firsthand. But he became fascinated by citrus and railroads while studying at UC Riverside, where the Citrus Experimental Station meant he was surrounded by acres of groves and his first history class was about railroads and political power. Octopus's Garden, published by the University Press of Kansas, is deeply researched, with a daunting 100 pages of notes and bibliography in the back. A rare academic work to take the Inland Empire seriously, the book grew out of Jenkins' doctoral dissertation and subsequent research. That included a summer internship at the Huntington Library and a travel grant to the California State Archives. He is a very talented researcher and writer, said Cliff Trafzer, the history professor and writer whom Jenkins considers a mentor. Murals extolling our citrus past are everywhere, but they tend to be nostalgic, idealized images like the ones on crate labels. Jenkins observes in his book that in one such mural in La Verne, No smudge pots exhale putrid exhaust to pollute the endless azure firmament. Hmm. An industry that paid poorly, dominated the Inland Empire landscape, was politically powerful, polluted the air and was intimately connected to transportation. Was citrus a more picturesque version of warehousing? That is a terrific parallel, Jenkins said. The packing houses were really the first warehouses. Acrylic paintings of the Pomona Valley icons Midway Building Materials, Pomona Fish Market, Ramon's Cactus Patch and Samo's Hamburgers decorate the walls of Some Crust Bakery in Claremont through November 1. The paintings are for sale for 50 each. Painter Jen Wilkins, a Pomona native, loves the midcentury buildings' distinctive signs. By taking photos and creating paintings of them, Wilkins says in her artist statement, I have attempted to preserve them in my way.",https://www.sbsun.com/2023/10/17/citrus-industry-in-inland-empire-wasnt-postcard-perfect-new-book-argues/,-1

A broken rail likely caused a train hauling 124 cars of coal to derail Sunday afternoon, killing a semitruck driver who was caught below the bridge that subsequently collapsed north of Pueblo, federal investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. The board's preliminary assessment determined that the bridge collapsed after the train derailed, sending coal and mangled train cars across Interstate 25 and closing the busy route between Pueblo and Colorado Springs. Thirty cars were derailed. Investigators remained on scene Tuesday to try to figure out what caused the broken rail and why warning systems did not alert crews about the broken rail, NTSB said in an update Tuesday. They will also look at the adequacy of prior track inspections and the condition and maintenance history of the bridge. The federal agency will release its preliminary report within 30 days. A final report could take up to two years. The broken rail was east of the bridge over I-25, the NTSB said. Both northbound and southbound lanes of I-25 remained closed as crews continued to clear debris from the road. BNSF expects cleanup to be completed by Wednesday, when CDOT engineers and maintenance crews will assess the damage and determine what repairs are needed to reopen the highway. Drivers headed south are advised to use Colorado 115 until they reach Penrose, before heading east on YOU.S. 50 toward Pueblo. Northbound drivers can exit the interstate at YOU.S. 50 and go west, toward Pueblo West, then north on Purcell until they reach I-25, CDOT said. There still remains confusion over who owns the bridge that collapsed and who was responsible for maintaining it. A spokesperson for BNSF, which operated the train that derailed and owns the line it runs on, told The Colorado Sun the state owns the bridge. But the state told The Associated Press on Monday that the ownership was unclear and that officials are reviewing records to figure it out. It is also unclear where the train was headed. But an Xcel Energy spokesperson said the coal was not en route to the Comanche power plant in Pueblo and will not affect the plant's operations. The Pueblo County Coroner's Office identified the truck driver as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, Calif.

Transport Light rail the casualty in transport's political war The election results existentially threaten Auckland's light rail plans - but would a less political approach to transport solutions have struck a healthier compromise? In what may be the end note of the tormented saga of the unbearable lightness of rail in Auckland, the region's light rail looks to be doomed before even a metre of track was laid down. Despite the bipartisan agreement that the country's biggest city needs some big transport solutions fast, the ambitious mass transit system was tied closely to the political fortunes of the Labour Party. READ MORE:  Labour's light rail at the end of the tunnel  National to derail Labour's light rail plans Last weekend's red train wreck has likely derailed the city centre to airport route before it even left the station. Auckland Light Rail Limited chief executive Tommy Parker signalled yesterday that the organisation was ready and waiting to brief the incoming Minister of Transport and looked forward to receiving direction from the government. That is an optimistic statement in light of an incoming National-led government. National has made no secret of its disdain for the project, with transport spokesperson Simeon Brown calling it light fail and saying he would kill it. National's transport promises for Auckland have instead focused on roads and busways, as well as potentially removing Auckland's regional fuel tax. But although Auckland Light Rail Limited has yet to start construction, design and consultation work has been underway for six years. Transport commentator Matt Lowrie said that work was likely to go into the filing cabinet and not be seen again. There is a small chance a surface solution might still happen, and that is only if Wayne Brown really pushed it, but I think that is probably unlikely as well, he said. No one's going to want to touch light rail for a while. As we have seen in the past, whether it is heavy rail or light rail, it is often 20 years again before you see it come up again. He said it was a frustrating turn of events beginning with Labour's pursuit of a more expensive tunnelled option, which greatly pushed forward any potential opening date and added zeroes to the price tag. That in turn increased National's antipathy for the project - and now it looks like the initial plans have gone from light, to heavy, to nothing. It is really frustrating because as I said if the government had just carried on with what the plan was and not gotten distracted by other ideas they would have delivered it by now, Lowrie said. That would have been a whole different outcome for Auckland, and probably for Labour, because that would have been something they delivered they could have pointed to that was working well. Initial plans for the light rail corridor were discussed in 2015, with arterial routes such as Dominion Road and Sandringham Road seeing something of a return to the 1950s when trams shuttled Aucklanders along them between the suburbs and the city. Pandemic delays and changes to the brief increased the scope of the project in the ensuing years. That is given opposition parties a solid target to swing at - Simeon Brown said the slow-coach project was emblematic of a Government that does not know how to deliver major transport projects. But even Labour's allies have been sceptical of the project. The Green Party has supported light rail, but would rather have seen a surface option. Co-leader James Shaw told an Infrastructure New Zealand debate that he could get surface light rail delivered in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch for the same price as the Auckland tunnelled option. But is there hope for a surface option to rise from the ashes of Labour's tunnelled plan? Lowrie suspected that will be the hope of the officials working for the otherwise soon-to-be dismantled Auckland Light Rail Limited. Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown has also shown enthusiasm for surface light rail and disdain for the expense of tunnels under the isthmus. He will be hoping to have some sway over whichever coalition is formed over the next couple of weeks. He has published an Auckland Manifesto he wants Christopher Luxon and team to agree to which gives the engine room of New Zealand more independence. Much of his desired independence for the region concerns transport. Politicians have got into a bad habit of announcing big headline-grabbing mega-projects at election time which are simply too expensive and impractical, Brown wrote in the manifesto. Sometimes they even announce council will be funding them without talking to us. These projects end up costing us millions to plan, only for a new government to come along and replace them with the next one (which invariably has neither the financial support to meet the up-front capital cost or the consequential operating cost). Lowrie said the polarising promises of tunnelled light rail had politicised the transport discourse, when 10 or 15 years ago these kinds of decisions might have been made in a more technocratic way with cost-benefit analysis having more weight than winning votes. I think we have increasingly shifted away from having an independent transport discussion, he said. Lowrie said that shift opens the door to pork-barrel politics and billion-dollar motorways or roads that carry a thousand vehicles a day on it. The politicisation of light rail may be just the thing that signed its death warrant. For National to pick it up in any form would constitute quite the you-turn - although historically there is been wriggle room between campaign promises and post-election delivery. The project's official website still makes big promises: Light Rail is coming to the city. It may still be coming, but if Lowrie is right, we might have to wait a generation.",https://www.newsroom.co.nz/page/light-rail-the-casualty-in-transports-political-war,-1

Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a news release. The steel bridge built in 1958 collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away piles of coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has previously recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was under investigation. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, Sulick said. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Federal investigators late Monday approved cleanup work along I-25 after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records Tuesday, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo, of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data that is based on reports submitted by railroads. Pressure for the industry to improve safety has grown in recent months following a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit a wind energy company in Pueblo the day after the accident but postponed the trip at the last minute to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The accident remains under investigation. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Amazon warehouse murder suspect killed during shootout with police near I-40, MPD says A man suspected of shooting a woman to death at an Amazon warehouse in Mississippi died just hours later after getting into a shootout with Memphis Police, officials said. The deadly confrontation took place in the area of I-40 and Whitten Road around 3:20 p.m. on June 2, shortly after authorities said 45-year-old Corey Brewer shot 44-year-old Ebony Leshay Crocket three times at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake, Mississippi. Footage shows Brewer's white car surrounded by officers with guns pointed at him. He got a gun, one officer can be heard repeatedly yelling. In the video, Brewer is hardly visible behind the dark tint of the car's windshield. But, according to Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy's office, Brewer pointed his gun at the officers. Gunshots begin to ring out striking the car repeatedly and shattering the car's windows. All of the officers begin backing away from the car as the shooting starts in the middle of the busy intersection. Eventually, one officers yells Hold your fire. Brewer was killed in the shootout. Horn Lake Police said that Brewer knew Crockett through their employment at Amazon. Family of Amazon worker shot and killed in Horn Lake retains civil rights attorney Ben Crump Two weeks after a woman was shot to death at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake, Mississippi, her family has retained nationally-prominent civil rights and personal injury lawyer Ben Crump, according to a press release from Crump's office. Crockett's family hired attorney Ben Crump who said that Brewer had been fired from Amazon before the deadly shooting and had a restraining order against him when he arrived at the warehouse and killed the 44-year-old woman in the parking lot as she walked to her car. The death of Ebony Crockett is tragic in a number of different ways. Ebony went through all of the appropriate avenues to protect herself from this disturbed man, only to be killed by him as she was leaving her workplace due to Amazon's lack of security measures, said a statement from Ben Crump's office after Crockett's death. Amazon, a company worth hundreds of billions of dollars, is responsible for protecting its guests from imminent danger. Ebony's killer had come on the Amazon property weeks before her death to harass her, and complaints were made to management - the warning signs were there. Why was Brewer able to come back on the property after his firing and Amazon management being notified of his continued harassment of Ebony to ultimately kill her?

Ahmad Hasaballah  Getty Images The taps in the besieged Gaza Strip are running dry, and residents are scrambling to save every last drop of water as the shortage reaches a crisis point. Dunia Aburahma said her family has rationed supplies, allowing her only a quart of drinking water per day. I have not taken a shower for four days now, said Aburahma, 22, an architecture student who fled northern Gaza with her family last week ahead of Israel's threatened ground invasion and is now living with relatives in Zawaida in central Gaza. After Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel left at least 1,400 people dead and about 200 people taken hostage, Israel announced a full blockade of Gaza, preventing food, water and fuel from entering the area, which is home to 2 million people. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Gaza and about 12,000 people have been wounded. The lack of water is so dire that surgeons at Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital have reverted to chemical disinfectants. Water pressure down in hospital to the point we cannot sterilize instruments, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon at the hospital, said in a message over WhatsApp. At the heart of the water supply issue is the lack of fuel and electricity, which powers everything from water pumps to treatment centers. Only about 10 of Gaza's water comes from Israel; most of what residents drink is drilled locally, and then needs to be treated to remove salt and contamination, said Elai Rettig, an assistant professor at Bar-Ilan University who studies environmental policy. But about 50 of Gaza's electricity comes from Israel, while the rest is generated in Gaza with diesel-powered generators. Much of Gaza's fuel is trucked in from a refinery in Haifa, and Hamas has rapidly diminished Gaza's supplies for its own use. Without enough fuel and electricity to run the desalination and water treatment plants, there is no clean water to flow through the pipes, Rettig said in an interview Monday. And so the major consequence of cutting electricity supply is not necessarily electricity, but water supply to the population, Rettig said. And that is where things can become a humanitarian crisis. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) warned in a situation report Tuesday that concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases are high given the collapse of water and sanitation services. Water remains a key issue as people will start dying without water, the group said. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday that the YOU.S. and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. Even before the current conflict, 97 of the population of Gaza had to rely on informal and unregulated private water tankers and small-scale informal desalination plants for drinking water, according to a 2021 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Direct pipelines were a luxury, and the risk of waterborne diseases was rampant. The private water tankers would load up at the nearest water station and then go around to neighborhoods. Those who are in need of water could fill their tanks, which are usually placed on the roofs of their homes. But those tankers run on fuel, which is now in short supply. And water pulled directly from the ground, which would require electricity and then treatment, is unsafe to drink. The situation is near catastrophic, Imene Trabelsi, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told NBC News on Tuesday, adding that there were already reports of water contamination, which can pose serious health risks. Trabelsi said the two main water desalination stations in Gaza were no longer functioning. Aburahma's family was among the approximately 1 million people who have been displaced in Gaza since the conflict began, according to the UNRWA. Many of them moved from northern Gaza to the south over the past several days after Israeli authorities said they would resume supplying water in the south, as a way to make people leave the north, amid an anticipated ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza City. Israel's bombardments and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people to the south have put pressure on Gaza's infrastructure, and water has not arrived to places where people need it. The UNRWA said Israel had supplied water for only three hours in parts of southern Gaza on Monday. We cannot get our clothes cleaned, said Aburahma, who is staying at a relative's house with 53 other people. Whenever I need to clean some of the laundry, I fill a bottle of the water we keep and a bit of soap to clean them on my hands. Jonathan Conricus, international spokesman for Israel Defense Forces, blamed Hamas for using goods, including fuel, that could support civilians in Gaza. The people in Gaza are not our enemies, Conricus told NBC News' Tom Llamas. We are not targeting them. Palestinian authorities say that even if Israel were to resume supplying more water, without power, it cannot be pumped to homes. For us as a water authority, if Israel pumps water, it cannot be supplied to the population due to the interruption of the electricity required to pump it, the Palestinian Water Authority told NBC News in a Facebook message. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands have fled after the evacuation order, the water pressure was so low that Rahaf Abuzarifa was using cups and buckets to collect any drops that would fall. We gave each a 2-liter bottle and each one is managing his own bottle, said Abuzarifa, 21, who is living in a house with 17 other people. Those 2 liters must last for three days, she said, adding that everyone in the family had only taken a bath once since the war broke out earlier this month.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gaza-taps-running-dry-water-shortage-crisis-point-rcna120753,-1

The victims were connected to a member of the Jamaican parliament. A YOU.S. Navy petty officer has been arrested, accused of orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot to kill a woman and baby in Jamaica connected to a local member of parliament who the officer had a relationship with. Leoda Vanessa Bradshaw, 34, was indicted last week in connection with the kidnapping and murders of Toshyna Patterson, 27, and her 10-month-old daughter Sarayah Paulwell. Bradshaw had a relationship and a child with Phillip Paulwell, a Member of Parliament for Kingston East and Port Royal, and she considered him to be her spouse, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Kingston said in a news release. Prosecutors said that Sarayah Paulwell is the daughter of that same politician, Paulwell. Bradshaw visited Jamaica on Sept. 6, prosecutors said, and in an apparent act of vengeance hatched a plan with three men to kidnap and kill Patterson and her child. The three men were her cousin Roland Balfour, Richard Brown and Roshane Miller. The plan included partial payment by Bradshaw to the men, prosecutors said in the release. In conversations from Sept. 6 to 9, the men agreed under Bradshaw's direction to kidnap and kill Patterson and her daughter, the release said. On Saturday Sept. 9, the murder plot was carried out, prosecutors said. Bradshaw took Patterson and the baby from their home in Kingston in a tinted SUV and subsequently delivered them to men, including two of her co-conspirators in St. Andrew, the release said. The Crown further alleges that Ms. Patterson and her daughter were forcibly taken to an area in East Kingston and murdered by these said men who were armed with a firearm, prosecutors said. Jamaica Constabulary Force Deputy Commissioner of Police Fitz Bailey said in a press conference their bodies were burned and disposed of after their killings. He called the case one of the most painful investigations the force had seen in recent times. Authorities did not explicitly state a motive for the slayings. Bradshaw was indicted on two counts of conspiracy to kidnap, two counts of conspiracy to murder, two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of capital murder. Richard Brown was indicted on two counts of conspiracy to kidnap, two counts of conspiracy to murder, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of murder. Roshane Miller and Roland Balfour were each indicted on two counts of accessory before the fact to kidnapping and two counts of accessory before the fact to murder. The indictments were proffered before the Home Circuit Court last week. Bradshaw and Balfour appeared in Home Circuit Court on October 13 are scheduled to return on December 1. NBC News has reached out to attorneys for Bradshaw. It is not immediately clear who is representing Miller and Brown. Bert Samuels, an attorney for Balfour, told NBC News that Balfour intends to plead not guilty, which will be entered once trial commences. He said the attorneys have not been given the full discovery in the case yet. The matter was fast tracked by going straight to the Supreme Court. So the matter is moving along swiftly and we are hoping that trial will come soon where we can put forward his defense, Samuels said. The YOU.S. Navy confirmed that Bradshaw was a petty officer assigned to a talent acquisition team in Miami. In a statement the Navy said it takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and is cooperating with investigative and law enforcement authorities. The matter is currently under investigation by Jamaican authorities and the Navy Criminal Investigative Service, the Navy said. Paulwell shared a statement on Instagram Sunday saying: The past few weeks have been extremely difficult for me as I grappled with the abduction of my daughter and her mother. I have prayed unceasingly for the safe return of Toshyna Patterson and my daughter Sarayah and I am heartbroken that the worst has happened. That anyone could murder a mother and an innocent baby is unimaginable and my heart is heavy with sadness, he wrote. As a human being, father, lawyer and legislator I am hoping that all who were involved are brought to justice and punished to the fullest extent of the law. He did not acknowledge a relationship with Bradshaw and said he has cooperated fully in the investigation.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-navy-officer-indicted-alleged-murder-hire-plot-killed-woman-baby-rcna120848,-1

Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket fired by Palestinian militants. The health ministry said at least 500 people had been killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed were from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. The carnage came as the YOU.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to Gaza and ahead of President Joe Biden's planned visit to the Mideast. War between Israel and Hamas raises fears about rising US hostility The war between Israel and Hamas is raising fears about rising hostility across the United States. Experts say crimes against YOU.S. Jewish communities tend to escalate when conflict erupts in the Middle East, and anti-Muslim crimes also can spike, particularly when Americans are taken hostage or killed. In Illinois, a landlord is accused of attacking a Palestinian American tenant and her son with a knife on Saturday because of their Muslim faith, stabbing the 6-year-old boy to death and seriously injuring the mother. The sheriff, prosecutors and family all said the boy and his mother were targeted for being Muslim. Biden did not make Israeli-Palestinian talks a priority. Arab leaders say region now paying the price WASHINGTON (AP) -- The explosion of Israeli-Palestinian violence has Arab leaders faulting a Biden administration policy that moved away from big YOU.S. pushes for a broad Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Biden officials have made clear from early on they would focus instead on seeking modest improvements of conditions for Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territory. Regionally, President Joe Biden has concentrated efforts on pushing more Arab countries to sign one-on-one accords with Israel, as hoped-for stabilizing measures. The 1973 Arab-Israeli war had led a half-century of YOU.S. leaders to push for a big Israeli-Palestinian accord as a regional priority. Republicans reject Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on the first ballot, but more voting likely WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans have rejected congressman Jim Jordan for House speaker on the first ballot. More voting is expected Tuesday as the staunch ally of Donald Trump works to shore up support and seize the speaker's gavel. Clearly, not all Republicans are ready to elevate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jordan to the center seat of YOU.S. power, second in line to the presidency. Twenty Republicans voted against Jordan. Some are still upset over Kevin McCarthy's sudden ouster as speaker two weeks ago. With Trump's backing, a win for the Ohio congressman would show just how far the GOP's once far-right flank has moved into the party's mainstream. Trump returns to his civil fraud trial, hears an employee and an appraiser testify against him NEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump has returned to the New York civil fraud trial that imperils his real estate empire. He watched and deplored the case Tuesday as an employee and an outside appraiser testified that his company essentially put a thumb on the scale when sizing up his properties' value. New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit alleges that Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets in financial statements used to make deals and get financing. Trump denies any wrongdoing. He says his assets were actually undervalued. He also says banks and other recipients were told to check out the numbers themselves. Ukraine uses US-provided long-range ATACMS missiles against Russian forces for the first time WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that the United States quietly delivered a small number of the long-range ballistic missiles Ukraine said it urgently needed, and Ukraine has started using them on the battlefield against Russia. Zelenskyy on Tuesday said they were used effectively. He had been pressing the YOU.S. to provide the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. President Joe Biden had promised the missiles last month. Their delivery to the warfront gives Ukraine a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. Belgian police kill Tunisian man suspected of shooting 3 Swedish soccer fans, killing 2 of them BRUSSELS (AP) -- Authorities in the Belgian capital shot and killed a Tunisian national hours after they say he gunned down three Swedish soccer fans, killing two of them. Investigators are still trying to determine a motive for Monday night's attack in Brussels, which happened not far from where Belgium's men's soccer team was hosting Sweden in a European Championships qualifier. Acting on a tip, authorities say they tracked the attacker to a cafe, where they shot and killed him. A federal prosecutor says the man posted a video online in which he claimed that he had killed three Swedish people and said the Quran was a red line for which he is ready to sacrifice himself. Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap A clinical trial is recruiting thousands of volunteers to try to figure out if 3D mammograms are better than standard 2D imaging for catching advanced cancers. The trial includes a large number of Black women who face disparities in breast cancer death rates. The study has enrolled nearly 93,000 women from several nations and 32 YOU.S. states. The newer 3D technique has been around for a decade, but there is never been conclusive evidence that 3D is better than 2D at detecting advanced cancers. Previous studies did not randomly assign patients to a screening method, the gold standard for research. Broken rail caused fatal Colorado train derailment that collapsed bridge, early findings show The truck driver killed when a train derailed and collapsed a bridge over Interstate 25 in Colorado has been identified as a California man. The Pueblo County coroner says the victim was 60-year-old Lafollette Henderson, of Compton. The National Transportation Safety Board announced preliminary findings Tuesday that a broken rail caused Sunday's derailment of 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal. Coal and mangled rail cars spilled onto the highway, and the bridge collapsed as Henderson was driving underneath. I-25 is the main north-south route through Colorado. It is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear debris from the site. Prosecutors seeking to recharge actor Alec Baldwin in fatal shooting on movie set SANTA FE, N.M.

They said additional facts have emerged in the shooting on the set of the Western movie Rust that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm of rainfall and gales which, according to the forecaster, could cause a danger to life. What is an amber weather warning? For a storm to be named, it needs to have the potential to cause an amber or red weather warning on the Met Office's national severe weather warnings service in the UK, or the Irish or Dutch equivalents. Weather warnings can be issued for the following types of weather: They can be issued for the whole of the country, or just for specific areas. The latter is more common. Sometimes dual warnings are made, for example for rain and wind. There are three tiers of weather warning; yellow, amber and red. The colour a warning is given depends on a combination of both the effect the weather may have and the likelihood of damage occurring. These impacts can include damage to property, travel delays and cancellations, loss of water supplies, power cuts and, in the most severe cases, bring a danger to life, the Met Office says. Here is how each level is defined: Yellow warning: Yellow warnings can be issued for a range of weather situations. Many are issued when it is possible that the weather will cause some low level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places. Many people may be able to continue with their daily routine, but there will be some that will be directly affected and so it is important to assess if you could be affected. Other yellow warnings are issued when the weather could bring much more severe damage to most people but the likelihood of those impacts is much lower. It is important to read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning. Amber warning: There is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans. This means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property. You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact. Red warning: Dangerous weather is expected and, if you have not already done so, you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the severe weather. It is very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. You should avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities. The influence of Storm Babet will begin to be felt late on Tuesday and into Wednesday, the Met Office says, but the worst of the weather will be from Thursday through to Saturday. Heavy and, in places, disruptive rainfall will move in from the south and west, impacting Northern Ireland and much of England and Wales, it adds. As the rain moves northwards it will stall across central and eastern parts of Scotland, where it will become heavy and persistent. Strong south-easterly winds will also create dangerous conditions along the east coast of the UK, with large waves an additional hazard. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wardle said: Storm Babet will bring disruption for parts of the UK in the coming days, with heavy rain and strong winds likely for many. Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. As well as heavy rain, Storm Babet will bring some very strong winds and large waves near some eastern coasts too. Gusts around 70mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. Met Office warnings will continue to be reviewed as the forecast develops.",https://inews.co.uk/news/what-is-amber-weather-warning-met-office-alerts-explained-storm-babet-2693488,-1

Lawyers complain that the offices of the Master of the High Court are increasingly dysfunctional. As a result, people are unable to tie up deceased estates, set up or liquidate trusts, or appoint overseers of trusts and estates, among other legal procedures. According to GroundUp, the Master's Office also manages the Guardian's Fund, which manages money for people legally incapable of managing their affairs, such as children or people with mental disabilities. The Master's Office was functioning well enough until Covid, a Cape Town attorney, who wished to be anonymous, told GroundUp. They cannot seem to pick themselves up again. GroundUp was shown photos, apparently from inside the Johannesburg Master's Office, that show papers scattered across carpets and desks. Attorneys say delays at the Master's Office are unpredictable. Some documents are issued in the required few weeks; others take months. Pretoria attorney Ronel van Rooyen said: The filing system seems to be random. READ  Joburg High Court is a 'death trap', ignored report shows as Deputy Judge President flags fire risks She said the Master's Office did not respond to emails or phone calls. Yet members of the public, including attorneys, are unlikely to get hold of any staff if they go to the office. There is no boss taking control, she said. Another Cape Town attorney, who also wished to remain anonymous, explained that, when liquidating the estate of a deceased, documents are submitted to the Master's Office and a letter of executorship should be issued within 21 days. Without this letter, the assets remain frozen. It is a very simple process. They just need to process the documents, he said. But now six to 10 follow-ups in person are required to see that it is done. He said it can take nearly a year to just get a letter of executorship. You can just assume that the further you are in the process, the more it will be delayed, he said. There are 15 steps needed to wrap up an estate, according to Brenton Ellis, from the Fiduciary Institute of Southern Africa (FISA). According to Ellis, the entire process of wrapping up an estate ought to take six to eight months, but this turnaround time is currently highly unlikely. FISA closely monitors the Master's Office and has provided an overview of the process and challenges of wrapping up an estate. Katherine Gascoigne, a Johannesburg attorney, who specialises in work with the Master's Office nationwide, says: It holds millions of rands which cannot go back into the economy because heirs cannot access their money. The knock-on effect is enormous. Gascoigne said her law firm has applied so often for a mandamus writ - an application to the court to force a government institution to do its job - that it has almost become protocol. Poor digitisation The Master's Office has been trying to speed up its systems through digitisation. In March, the Gauteng Master's Offices took more than a decade of files off-site to scan them for easy access. We were given a six-week period in which we would have no access. Now, however, many months later, we still have no access, said Gascoigne. She said the online service portal also does not go far enough. We cannot access any documents and there is no directive as to whether we have been approved and what our next step should be. The Master's Office still relies heavily on in-person visits to relay information. A week ago, Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola launched the new Deceased Estates Portal, which allows people to register deceased estates themselves. I have my doubts about whether this is going to be a silver bullet. Staff still need to process and check each and every document, said a Cape Town attorney. The new online system has been subject to three cyber-attacks in the last three years. Most recently, the Guardian's Fund lost R18 million to fraudulent transactions. During each attack, services were suspended for weeks. The Information Regulator claims the 2021 hack would have been prevented if the Department of Justice had renewed its anti-virus software licences. It fined the department R5 million for violation of the Protection of Private Information Act. READ  Justice dept to procure anatomical dolls to help children articulate sex crimes in court Crispin Phiri, the spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said: The procurement process, though initiated on time, took much longer than expected and resulted in us having a gap in the support and maintenance of these licences. Attorneys we spoke to said Master's offices, except for Pretoria, are not operational during load shedding. But Phiri said the Deceased Estate online system will always be accessible to the public, even during load shedding, because it is centrally hosted from our main data centre that has UPS and sufficient back-up power. It might partially affect the response times (by a few hours) from the Master's offices that do not have back-up power because they might not be able to login to the system during those hours of load shedding. Chronic staff shortage While the Master's Office mostly only provides an in-person service, there is a nationwide staff shortage of assistant masters, who sign off on files and direct the public on what they need to do next. According to FISA, the Cape Town Master's Office has a 35 vacancy rate on estate controllers. Pretoria attorney Francois Bouwer, said: There is no leader taking control at the Master's Office, at least in Pretoria. He said the role of Acting Master rotates between staff every few months. We have had instances where an assistant will issue a query sheet that is not in line with the Chief Master's directives. They act on their own discretion, said Bouwer. Another issue, said Bouwer, was that some staff at the Master's Office do not always accept printed copies of court documents. We get court orders electronically, which we print and submit to the Master. Some assistant masters do not accept the court orders because they are not originally stamped and signed by the registrar. Now, we have to go to the court to get a signed affidavit for each and every document we submit. Bouwer said this was not a requirement of any Act or Chief Master's directive. Gascoigne said the Johannesburg Attorneys Association offered to help the Master's Office clear its delays, but they were turned down. She suspects it is because Master's Office staff earn overtime for clearing the backlog. It is getting so bad that the Gauteng Attorneys Association approached Judge President of Gauteng Dunstan Mlambo to create a specialised court for Master's Office matters, she said. Haphazard filing Attorneys used to be able to go into the Master's Office and access non-digitised files, but members of the public and attorneys are now being denied access in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria. They often cannot find the files in the warehouse. We have had matters where we have been waiting for files for years. A Cape Town attorney, who did not wish to be named, said things went wrong during the Covid lockdown. A lot of files were misappropriated and some of them were lost. In a lot of cases, people had to resubmit quite a lot of documentation, they said. In August 2022, Lamola said the backlog caused by Covid and a cyber-attack in September 2021 would be cleared by the end of 2022. Bribery and corruption Johannesburg attorney Lesley Blake suspected there could be corrupt practices at some offices. She was recently appointed to a 13-year-old estate case. Apparently, an executor had been appointed by the deceased's wife, but the dead person was unmarried. Properties were sold and much of the estate liquidated. The previous attorneys said they had a letter of executorship, but the Master's Office told Blake that they had lost the files. In 2021, the Presidency and the Department of Justice empowered the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to look into dozens of allegations of fraud, corruption and misconduct. The SIU temporarily shut down every Master's Office in the country to conduct its investigation. That same year, Acting Chief Master Theresia Bezuidenhout was accused of interfering in disciplinary processes against corrupt employees. She has since been replaced. Failure to respond to our queries We attempted to get comment directly from the Master's Office. On 11 October, we emailed Thelma Setetemela, who has the title Personal Assistant: Chief Directorate Strategy and Policy. She responded on 12 October, stating that she would forwarded our questions to Penelope Roberts, the Acting Chief Master. Despite sending follow-up emails, we have received no further response.",https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/why-lawyers-are-fed-up-with-the-shambles-in-masters-offices-20231017,-1

The record confirms that this part of the world's largest rainforest is suffering its worst drought, just a little over two years after its most significant flooding. In the morning, the water level in the city's port went as low as 44.3 feet, down from 98.5 feet registered in June 2021 -- its highest level on record. The Negro River drains about 10 of the Amazon basin and is the world's sixth largest by water volume. Madeira River, another main tributary of the Amazon, has also recorded historically low levels, causing the halt of the Santo Antonio hydroelectric dam, Brazil's fourth largest. Throughout Brazil's Amazon, low river levels have left hundreds of riverine communities isolated and struggling to get access to drinkable water. The drought also has disrupted commercial navigation that supplies Manaus, a city of 2 million with a large industrial park. Manaus is the largest city and capital of Amazonas, the state hit hardest by the drought. In late September, 55 of 62 municipalities there entered states of emergency due to the severe drought. There is no more water to go through. Navigation is over, boatman Cledson Lopes Brasil told The Associated Press. (MORE: Floating Amazon Village Sunk To Dry Lake Bed) Brasil operates in Marina do Davi port, a getaway to dozens of riverine communities, some of them with sandy beaches that attract tourists. The once bustling area is now surrounded by parched soil, with many boathouses high and dry. Manaus and other nearby cities are also suffering from high temperatures and heavy smoke from nearby man-caused fires for deforestation and pasture clearance. The drought is also the likely because of dozens of river dolphin deaths in Tefe Lake, near the Amazon River. This is a startling contrast to July 2021, when Negro River waters took over part of the Manaus downtown area. The historic flood, which also ruined crops of hundreds of riverine communities, lasted for about three months. Negro River ends near Manaus, where it converges with the Amazon River, which is called the Solimoes River in Brazil upstream from this confluence. In Brazilian maps, this marks the beginning of the Amazon, with Negro as the second main tributary. In international maps, however, the Amazon River begins in Peru. Philip Fearnside, an American researcher at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research, a public agency, expects the situation to deteriorate, both during the ongoing event and in the future with increasing frequency and severity of similar events with climate change. (MORE: El Nio October Update: Strong Event Still Favored This Winter) He said surface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is now warmer than during the Godzilla El Nio of 2015-16 and is expanding. In the Amazon, these Pacific warmings primarily lead to droughts in the northern part of the region. Moreover, a warm water patch in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean is causing drought in the southern part of the Amazon, similar to what happened in 2005 and 2010, according to researchers. The forecast is for the start of the rains to be delayed compared to normal, and for a drier-than-normal rainy season, Fearnside said. This could result not only in extreme low water this year, but also low levels in 2024. Until the rainy season begins in the basin, the situation that is already underway should worsen.",https://weather.com/news/weather/news/2023-10-17-el-nino-drought-in-brazil-amazon-record-low-river,-1

Today I am especially grateful to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. They are being implemented very accurately - the ATACMS have proven themselves, President Zelenskyy said. During the night of October 17, the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked helicopters and equipment of the Russian occupation forces at airfields near occupied Luhansk and Berdyansk. The Wall Street Journal wrote that Ukrainian troops could have used ATACMS for the first time. The military noted that during this operation, called DRAGONFLY, they managed to destroy the following: According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the ammunition depot in Berdyansk detonated until 4 a.m., and the detonation in Luhansk lasted until 11 a.m. Enemy losses in manpower amounted to dozens of dead and wounded. Unidentified persons stole the chevrons on the grave of Andriy Pilshchikov, pilot of the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade (call sign Juice) for the second time, his girlfriend Melanie Podolyak said on October 16. On October 17, the Kyiv police reported that during the monitoring of online resources, they found a publication about the theft of items from the grave of a Ukrainian defender at one of the capital's cemeteries. Investigators opened criminal proceedings over the desecration of the soldier's grave under Part 1 of Article 297 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Law enforcement officers are identifying the perpetrators. MPs passed the bill on strengthening financial monitoring of PEPs (politically exposed persons). Now, instead of three years after leaving office, top officials will actually have PEP status for life. The law provides for stricter supervision of the wealth of Ukrainian PEPs and increased liability of primary financial monitoring entities, such as banks, for unjustified refusal to provide financial services to users. PEPs are politically exposed persons, who are individuals with important public functions, which makes them at a higher risk of potential involvement in bribery, money laundering, corruption, illicit enrichment through their positions, etc. Ukraine returned three children to the government-controlled territory. They were in the temporarily occupied part of Kherson Oblast. When the Russians entered Kherson, the parents of 10-year-old Oleksandr, 8-year-old Daryna, and 6-year-old Yakiv decided to send the children to their grandmother's village, hoping for greater safety. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine has put on the wanted list the current MP, member of the For Future parliamentary group Yaroslav Dubnevych. The agency noted that he is wanted because he is suspected of organizing the seizure of natural gas worth more than UAH 2.1 billion (58 million) and legalizing the proceeds of crime. However, on the day he was put on the wanted list, Dubnevych remotely joined a court hearing in another case - the embezzlement of UAH 93 million (2.6 million) from the state rail transport company Ukrzaliznytsia. According to the Anti-Corruption Action Center, Dubnevych said he was currently in a hospital in Ukraine. The prosecutor had no reports that the lawmaker had crossed the border.

Jim Jordan as the new House speaker, elevating a chief ally of Donald Trump to a center-seat of YOU.S. power and showing just how far the hard-right flank has moved into the GOP mainstream. After two weeks of angry Republican infighting since the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, the House is to vote in a showdown for the gavel. At least a handful of holdout Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio Republican as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. But with public pressure bearing down on lawmakers from Trump's allies including Fox News' Sean Hannity, it is not clear how long the holdouts can last. Jordan swiftly flipped dozens of detractors in a matter of days, shoring up reluctant Republicans who have few options left after McCarthy's ouster. People are also reading...

Police Scotland has warned to make trips only if necessary as the Met Office upgraded a yellow weather warning to amber for much of the north-east region for Thursday and Friday. Yellow warnings remain in place for the rest of the north of Scotland. The warnings follow some of the heaviest rain Scotland has witnessed since the 1890s, while the upcoming storm could hit some already saturated and flooded areas. The weekend of October 7 and 8 saw 100 to 150mm of rain falling widely across many areas across the southern and central Highlands. However, the current forecast rainfall predicts that some regions in the north-east could see those figures surpassed, with some areas seeing 150 to 200mm of rain over a two-to-three-day period. The Met Office further announced that the heavy rain will be accompanied by strong east to south-easterly winds. Journeys likely to be affected Stein Connelly, from Transport Scotland, said: We recently witnessed some of the most severe weather in Scotland since the 1890s, and another wave of challenging conditions is expected this week. Check before your travel as your journey is likely to be affected by these latest severe weather warnings - whether by foot, bike, car, rail or ferry. Chief Superintendent Hilary Sloan, Head of Road Policing, advised travellers to plan ahead and consider if their journey is really necessary or if it can be delayed until conditions improve. ScotRail Customer Operations Director Phil Campbell said: We will continue to monitor the forecast, and teams will be working around the clock to deal with any weather-related incidents that Storm Babet brings.

Ten minutes later, an Argo Wilis train came from the west and brushed past the Argo Semeru train, resulting in both rail tracks getting blocked. The carriages of the two trains were damaged and not fit to continue the trip.

2023-10-17 15:01:08.126,7787109617,weather,9d7cd3e4-fd5c-41a9-b75e-7bbf2f193d41,Meet the man tasked with keeping a lid on the Middle East,"WASHINGTON -- While Secretary of State Antony Blinken huddled with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday at the Kirya -- Israel's version of the Pentagon -- air raid sirens warned citizens in surrounding Tel Aviv neighborhoods to shelter in place. Blinken, Netanyahu and the Israeli war Cabinet were forced to hide in a bunker for five minutes before moving their meeting to an underground military command center, an indelible reminder of the fragility of life near the front lines. After nine hours of discussions, some with his Israeli counterparts and some with his YOU.S. team, Blinken emerged to say that President Joe Biden would visit Israel on Wednesday to demonstrate America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security and that Netanyahu had promised to work to secure humanitarian assistance for Palestinians. The United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza and them alone, including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way, Blinken said. That plan, whose details have not been released, represents a small but significant step in the direction of America's goals for managing the crisis -- and a personal diplomatic achievement for Blinken. For nearly a week, Biden's top emissary and longtime confidant has lived at the brink of an unfolding war in the Middle East, shuttling among seven countries over the past 133 hours as he articulates why America is supporting Israel's counter-offensive while seeking to keep other nations on the sidelines and limit the loss of civilian life on both sides of the Gaza border. Along the way, Blinken spoke with Biden daily -- every airplane ride or when we got back to the hotel, according to top Blinken adviser Derek Chollet -- to stay in close coordination. He is making a Herculean effort to stay in touch with the Arab World and trying to convince them that this is a different time for Israel, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who spoke at length with Blinken by phone Sunday night. The job of the secretary of state right now is to convince the region and the world writ large that this attack has changed the game -- that the old way of doing business died with the babies killed by Hamas -- and to prepare the Arab world for some tough times. Importantly, Graham added, he is also trying to get Israel to do all they can to minimize casualties. Blinken's charge is to make room for Israel to destroy Hamas without drawing Arab nations or their populations into the fight, which may require persuading Israel to exercise more restraint in its response than its leaders envision and convincing the Arab world that Israel is, in fact, doing that. As he spoke with Netanyahu, Israeli forces appeared to be on the verge of a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. It would be a monumental task for any diplomat in any era to contain a conflagration in the world's oldest tinder box, much less in the midst of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a massacre in Sudan. In that mission, Blinken has the confidence of Biden and top White House officials. The challenges we face in the Middle East and around the world require a secretary of State who is respected, who everyone knows speaks directly for the president, who has worked these issues going back many years, and who can get things done, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said in a statement. Secretary Blinken's deliberate marathon diplomacy across the region over the past few days is just the latest example of the great value he brings to President Biden on behalf of the American people. Blinken, who built his career as a Washington foreign policy hand with aggressive advocacy for intervention in defense of liberal democracy and human rights, is trying to restrain Middle East powers without the star power of many of his predecessors. In that way, he is reflective of a Biden Cabinet that departed from the high-profile Team of Rivals approach that President Barack Obama took in filling the top ranks of his administration with an all-star cast that included Biden, Hillary Clinton and several former governors. If Blinken has been the consummate Washington staffer, he is also something of the ideal Biden aide -- personally close to the boss, an expert in his field and unlikely to outshine the president. Unflappable and urbane, Blinken came to office with neither the medal-bedecked uniform of retired Gen. Colin Powell nor the international acclaim -- and presidential ambitions -- of Clinton. That can be a double-edged sword as he negotiates with foreign leaders who expect high-level attention from the YOU.S. and also value knowing that the secretary speaks to and for the president. Chollet said that he did not know whose idea it was for Biden to accept Netanyahu's invitation for a presidential visit, but that the secretary of state was the key player in laying the groundwork. Blinken's voice, from my perspective, was the most important because he was out here with everyone. He was on point, said Chollet, who is traveling with Blinken. He was able to get that fingertip feel of how it would land in Israel if the president visited, Chollet added. Daleep Singh, a former deputy national security adviser in the Biden White House, praised Blinken for executing a tough balancing act, noting the value his presence brings in prodding Israel to demonstrate restraint. Time is certainly your friend if you are trying to help a country think through the strategic implications of the day after -- every day allows for more thought to be put into a response, Singh said. Also, with him on the ground and the president on the way, it just increases the odds that Israel is not going to do anything that does not have alignment with the YOU.S. Foreign leaders can be sure there is little daylight between Biden and Blinken, who has no apparent agenda or aspiration for higher office, but there is also little public cost for slighting an official who does not have the global profile of some of his predecessors. Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly kept Blinken waiting overnight for a meeting in Riyadh this weekend. On Sunday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi noted that Blinken had spoken to Israelis earlier in the week as a Jew and claimed -- incorrectly and in front of Blinken -- that his own country had never persecuted Jews. I come first and foremost as a human being, a human being like so many others appalled at the atrocities committed by Hamas, Blinken responded in an apparent effort to play down the tribal appeal he had made to Israelis. Now 61, Blinken began his career as the chief foreign policy speechwriter on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton. He later served as staff director when Biden was the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as Biden's national security adviser and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration, and as the top foreign policy adviser on Biden's 2020 campaign. Friends say that background helps Blinken navigate effectively with little fanfare. It is actually a pretty big advantage, said former New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, who worked closely with Blinken in the Clinton administration and has remained a friend as their careers have crossed paths repeatedly in the ensuing decades. This is not a guy who is chasing headlines or seeking credit or worried about what his next job is going to be, Malinowski said. He is driven, and I have seen this over the years, by a very intense and intensely personal sense of responsibility to save lives in these situations and uphold a set of principles that he believes are at the heart of American foreign policy -- which is often easier said than done, especially in the Middle East. Blinken has spoken publicly about his sense of personal responsibility, as he did during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2021. His grandfather fled anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia, and his step-father, Samuel Pisar, survived four years in Nazi concentration camps. On a death march at the tail end of the war, Pisar ran away and hid in the woods, Blinken told the senators. He emerged when he saw a tank decorated with a five-pointed YOU.S. Army star, falling to his knees in front of an African American soldier. Pisar knew just three words in English, and he said them: God Bless America. That is who we are, Blinken said to the Senate committee where he had once served as the top aide. That is what we represent to the world, however imperfectly, and what we can still be at our best. Blinken's work is a manifestation of that view of the YOU.S. as a force for good, according to friends. You cannot know Tony without knowing the extent to which that family history shapes who he is, said Susan Rice, a former YOU.S. ambassador to the YOU.N. and national security adviser who worked with Blinken in the Clinton administration. He is been able to bring a clarity and a moral urgency and empathy to this work and this mission that he is on, which I hope the world sees is really human and deeply felt, Rice said. People who have worked with Blinken say that he has a rare ability to remain calm in stressful situations while also displaying empathy for those in distress. That lends Blinken credibility with his counterparts. But Tom Nides, Biden's former ambassador to Israel and onetime Obama deputy secretary of State, said Blinken's demeanor can be deceiving. I have been in the room when he was very aggressive with Netanyahu when he felt he was not doing the right thing, Nides said. People get confused between his appropriate attire, his dark tie and his white shirt. They should not misjudge his ability to have a velvet hammer in his right hand. Over the years, Blinken's worldview has often put him in a camp of Democratic foreign policy thinkers who favor using the American military to stop humanitarian crises -- either through threat or action. Blinken has written that force can be a necessary adjunct to effective diplomacy. He believes the YOU.S. did too little in confronting Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. In 2003, he helped Biden think through President George W. Bush's request for authorization to go to war in Iraq. Though Biden preferred giving Bush more limited powers, he voted with the Republican president. For Biden and for a number of others who voted for the resolution, it was a vote for tough diplomacy, Blinken told The New York Times nearly two decades later. At times, his tendency to turn to military force has placed him at odds with Biden, such as when the Obama administration struck Libya. Biden opposed that mission, which Blinken backed. When Biden sought to pull the YOU.S. out of a two-decade war in Afghanistan in 2021, Blinken pushed back privately, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Though he defended the move publicly, Blinken had resisted sticking to a withdrawal timeline negotiated by then-President Donald Trump and argued for creating more leverage with American military force, this person said. Biden and Blinken are close enough that Blinken attended the wedding of Biden's granddaughter at the White House last year. Although he has a reserved, low-key manner in public, Blinken has staked out a more hawkish stance on Ukraine than some others in the administration, according to sources familiar with the matter. During the course of the war, he has argued for sending more advanced weapons to Ukraine and disagreed with the idea that the YOU.S. should hold off on some arms shipments to avoid provoking Russia, seeing that as merely playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy. Blinken has been instrumental in Biden's successful effort to rally the NATO alliance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His response to the war in Ukraine reflects his strong belief that America has a leading role to play in the world, and that it can only succeed by working with allies. At Foggy Bottom, Blinken -- whose father served as ambassador to Hungary -- has been a reassuring presence for State Department diplomats after the turmoil of the Trump presidency, which was often at war with the foreign service. The diplomatic corps suffered an exodus of senior figures and a decline in applications during the previous administration, but career foreign service officers say Blinken has helped restore things to a more even keel. Graham, a close Trump ally, praised Blinken for taking a hawkish approach on Ukraine and said it is a benefit to Biden to have a lower-profile diplomat running the State Department. This is literally Biden's alter ego and most trusted ally running the foreign policy shop, he said. It is a secretary of state who has no agenda other than that of the president and who has no ambitions other than serving the president. And when he speaks, people know he is speaking for the president. Right now, Blinken is talking to everyone in the Middle East -- from Egypt to Qatar and Israel to Saudi Arabia. Whether those discussions prevent a broader war -- or limit civilian casualties -- remains to be seen. It is too soon to talk about results, Malinowski said. But I think this is a moment where a lot of Americans are seeing just how hard Tony works and how effective he can be in a moment of crisis.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/meet-antony-blinken-middle-east-secretary-of-state-israel-diplomacy-rcna120536,-1

Former UKIP and Brexit Party leader, and GB News presenter, Nigel Farage said the decision showed 'just how awful the Welsh Labour administration is'.

Finance minister Rebecca Evans has told the Senedd all departments except health and climate change have had to provide savings. In the summer, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the government had a 900m gap in its budget due to the financial crisis in the public sector and he had told every minister to find savings in their department. Now the finance minister has revealed where those cuts will come. The Welsh Government has found some money via taking 100m extra from reserves; an expectation there will be 150m in Barnett consequentials as a result of decisions taken in England, a proposed transfer of 147m from capital to revenue budgets, if the UK Treasury allows; and cuts within departments. READ MORE: When the tourism tax could be introduced for holidaymakers to Wales READ MORE: Blunt response to motorhome owner's review about 'pooping dog' at Gwynedd campsite Schools budgets have however been hit with a 40m cut to its capital spending budget and there are cuts to all departments except for health and climate change. Funding for health (10.4bn) has had to go up 425m because of the huge pressures health boards are facing. Transport for Wales will receive an extra 125m and the revenue support grant which funds councils has been protected. Education will take a funding hit and in the economy brief, 17.5m has been taken from apprenticeship funding and 5.3m from the React scheme which helps people facing or who have been made redundant. The Government has come under fire from Tory and Plaid members in the Senedd. The Welsh Conservatives said the government had the wrong priorities while Plaid said it was poor management of the finances. Minster Rebecca Evans said: Since setting these plans, we have experienced record prolonged levels of inflation along with continued challenges in the fiscal context, particularly in areas such as public sector pay. As a result, overall, we are having to spend more than previously planned this year, placing unprecedented pressure on the devolved Welsh Budget. Unlike the UK government, the Welsh Government is extremely constrained by a combination of the Fiscal Framework, a requirement to balance the budget and limitations on our ability to borrow or increase tax revenue. To deal with particular pressures facing the NHS and rail, we are having to reallocate funding meaning reductions in some areas. We have taken prudent action by revisiting spending plans for 2023-2024, to enable us to balance our duty of robust fiscal management with this Government's commitment to protect core public services whilst continuing to target support to those with the greatest need, as far as we are possibly able to. The cuts by department: Education: Revenue down 74.4m, capital down 40m Finance and local government: Revenue down 28.5m, capital down less than 10m Economy: Revenue down 28.6m, capital down 36.5m Rural affairs: Revenue down 17.3m, capital down 20.2m Social justice: Revenue down 7m, capital down less than 10m Running costs for Welsh Government: Down 27.5m Health: Up 425m (revenue), no change for capital budget Climate change: Up 86.2m (revenue) down 37.7m (capital). Savings elsewhere in the portfolio will see 125m extra to Transport to Wales What the opposition say: Welsh Conservative shadow finance minister Peter Fox MS said: The Labour Government have grossly mismanaged their budget, for them to be scrambling to make cuts wherever possible shows the desperation they have found themselves in by spending frivolously on unneeded pet projects whilst Plaid Cymru have enabled them by backing every decision through their cooperation agreement. Labour continues to impose a real terms health budget cut, whilst spending 120 million on 36 more Senedd politicians, and blanket 20mph speed limits costing the Welsh economy up to 9bn. It is clear, Labour have the wrong priorities, whilst the Welsh Conservatives will continue to priorities the people's priorities. Plaid Cymru finance spokesman Peredur Owen Griffiths MS said: Poor management from the Labour government in Cardiff and an unfair funding formula from Westminster has left the Welsh Government scrambling to fill gaps in already stretched public services. Labour have been telling us since August that they have been working to address a 900m blackhole in their budget - which is almost 5 of the entire block grant for the current financial year. I am sure many will be scratching their heads as to how they have been able to find an additional 550m now. There are vast discrepancies here between the level of initial allocated funding and the actual level of spending. This raises questions over how the figures were derived in the first place.

The show features all the elements that have come to define his distinct approach to horror cranked up to 11: steely visual palettes, full-circle plotting, an intimate blend of genre thrills and family melodrama, and monologues that gush out of his characters' mouths like that scene in The Exorcist. Flanagan also seems mighty angry. Usher is an anti-capitalist revenge fantasy in which members of a Sackler-inspired family are systematically killed off in impressively diverse ways owing to its patriarch's Faustian bargain with the literal embodiment of Death. Here, the ways the Ushers meet their ends are not unlike a Flanagan monologue: intricate, elaborate, and illustrative of the character experiencing it. Not all deaths are created equal, however. Let us rank the ways. (Needless to say, major spoilers lie ahead.) 10. Roderick Usher (Death by House Collapse) After being responsible for the deaths of millions and millions, the guy gets off easy. -- Nick Quah 9. Madeline Usher (Death by Egyptian Ritual and House Collapse) Madeline is the queen bitch of the Usher family, a woman whose genius has convinced her that she deserves to be immortal. Remember the plot of that not-good Johnny Depp movie Transcendence? That is Madeline's goal for herself: to upload her consciousness into an algorithm so she can live forever digitally. It is some egotistical rich-person shit, as is Madeline's obsession with the Egyptian queen Twosret. Lo and behold, the Egyptian artifacts Madeline collects throughout the miniseries come back around in a gruesome way. Madeline's sense of self-preservation is her downfall -- figuratively when she tries to poison brother Frederick and makes an enemy of her strongest ally, and literally when Roderick kills her using the same method, replaces her eyes with sapphires, and pulls out her brain with a traditional hook tool. You are a goddess, and you are going to live forever, Roderick promises her, but the Ushers are not good at bringing people back to life; they are good at torturing them. So Madeline staggers around blind in the basement, knocking into stuff for hours, while Roderick gets to tell his side of the story -- that is insult upon injury for this woman who considered herself the mastermind behind everything the siblings accomplished. You know she hates that she died with Frederick instead of fulfilling her wannabe-pharaoh desires. Good riddance! -- Roxana Hadadi 8. Napoleon Usher (Death by Fall) Edgar Allan Poe's short stories are filled with people driven to madness by guilt, but in this case, Leo's mania is driven less by guilt and more by trying not to get into trouble with his boyfriend, whose cat Leo found mysteriously shanked to death. But it is madness all the same, and we spend much of The Black Cat watching Xbox Gatsby being tormented by the replacement cat he got at the pound -- sold by Verna, natch -- which nobody else seems able to see. Dude gets his eyeball scratched! Gnarly. After wrecking the apartment in search of the spectral feline (a reasonable response), Leo spots the thing on the balcony, and his lunge to catch the animal leads him to fall over the railing to his death. A lame way to go, frankly, and points are docked for Verna's mutilating the boyfriend's perfectly innocent cat. -- NQ 7. Tamerlane Usher (Death by Mirror-Shard Impalement) This woman is so obsessed with how people perceive her that she cannot actually have sex with her husband, instead hiring sex workers to impersonate her and sleep with him while she watches. Her vanity and her need for control are combined into a toxic stew. Death makes an easy meal of Tammy by increasingly appearing as her double and undermining Tammy's sense of self. Of course, Roderick's only born-of-marriage daughter dies in a way that nods to her deep narcissism: impaled by countless glass shards from the mirrors she smashes in a failed attempt to exorcize Death's reflection. The slow-motion scene of Tammy bouncing on her mattress, skewered with fragments from the mirror hanging above her bed? Satisfying! -- RH 6. Victorine LaFourcade (Death by Self-Stabbing) Victorine's actual manner of death is kind of a snooze, but it is the stuff around the killing that makes a wicked impression. In The Fall of the House of Usher's take on Poe's classic The Tell-Tale Heart, the phantom sound is reimagined as that of Victorine's bionic device, a light mechanical wheeze that haunts the good doctor, who has already been losing it throughout the episode. Based on the title inspiration alone, we know the ever-present wheeze probably has something to do with Victorine sorta-kind of accidentally bludgeoning her partner, Alessandra Ruiz, to death. The turn arrives when Roderick eventually discovers Dr. Ruiz's body in Victorine's apartment. She had carved it open at the chest to implant the device and left it to rot in a room for days on end. Pretty metal. -- NQ 5. Eliza Usher (Death by Illness and Buried Alive) Annabeth Gish has the least screen time of anyone on this list, but man, she makes it worth it. Following in her own Haunting of Hill House footsteps as another tightly wound, religiously faithful matriarch, Gish plays Roderick and Madeline's mother, Eliza, who is so devoted to her abusive boss, Mr. Longfellow, that she never pushes him to acknowledge her children, the result of their secret affair. Or at least she does not push him when she is alive. But then she gets very ill, refuses to take any medicine or go to a hospital, and seemingly dies in bed, traumatizing the children. Roderick and Madeline then bury her in the backyard for some more trauma. Then she comes back to life, or maybe was never dead at all, and attacks the kids before eventually strangling Mr. Longfellow and finally dying on top of his corpse. It is all very dramatic and, thanks to Gish's wide-eyed, Bible-thumping performance, slightly campy -- a pleasant accompaniment to the absurdity of watching this woman get buried alive, crawl out of her coffin, and then go on a violent rampage. Good for her. -- RH 4. Frederick Usher (Death by Rube Goldberg Pendulum Axe) The ponytail alone should be enough to communicate Fred as a pathetic character, but there is also the whole maiming and torturing of his wife, Morelle, over his torment at almost being cuckolded. His death is consistent with the vibe. Having developed a (thematically appropriate) addiction to a drug that causes paralysis in high doses, he seizes up with his dong let loose while desecrating the abandoned warehouse once operated by the family's pharma corporation, i.e., the site of his wife's near infidelity. Mimicking his voice, Verna calls the demolition crew to go ahead with the building's destruction, and while a simple cave-in would have sufficed, physics and otherworldly forces conspire to create a deadly pendulum over the still-conscious Frederick, who is forced to watch as the makeshift blade slowly descends and severs his body in half. Maximum points for creativity and contrivance. -- NQ 3. Lenore Usher (Death by ... Death) Lenore's death is not gory or bloody or gross, but this ranking is not just about bloodshed -- it is also about impact, and this killing is the saddest of all. If you know your Poe, the name of Roderick's compassionate, responsible, principled granddaughter is already a bit of a tell; Poe's poem Lenore is about the tragic passing of an angel, a young woman gone too soon. Despite Auggie's assumption that Lenore is still alive and sending Roderick texts while the Usher patriarch confesses to his children's deaths, the possibility that the only good member of the family would survive the series is too good to be true. If Death had a heart, killing Lenore just to maintain Roderick's trade of legacy for success would break it. Because she does not, it breaks ours instead. -- RH 2. Camille L'Espanaye (Death by Chimp Attack) Thank you to Flanagan for the gnarliness of this death, reminiscent of that fantastic scene in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes when experimented-on-by-humans Koba tricks and kills two men who treat him as a circus attraction. Justice comes in many forms! The same goes for the death of Camille, basically the Usher Family consigliere who has secret files on every single person she knows and who loathes her half-sister Vic. Vic is no saint either since she is rumored to be killing, abusing, and torturing apes in her medical experiments. But Camille is not trying to expose Vic because she cares about these animals; she is doing it for her own gain, which makes her fatally brutal beating by Death in the form of a chimp feel earned. That moment when Verna jumps straight up onto the lab's surgical table, then stalks across it toward Camille? The gargantuan amounts of blood smeared on the lab's floor by Camille's ripped-apart body the next morning? The CGI smile on the chimp's face when it is discovered next to Camille's corpse? It all works to make this demise very nearly the miniseries' most disturbing. -- RH 1. Prospero Usher (Death by Warehouse Acid Rain) No other death in The Fall of the House of Usher tops the second episode's set piece: a spectacular shot of nightmare fuel that rockets the body count into the stratosphere. Perry, the youngest and horniest of the Usher clan, moves to burnish his capitalist cred by founding a monetized Eyes Wide Shut-esque sex rave for the debaucherous elite at the previously mentioned abandoned chemical warehouse once operated by the Usher family's company. But cursed offspring that he is, what was supposed to be a party that climaxes with fire sprinklers dousing everyone with water turns into pure horror as the partygoers are instead showered with acid rain. As the guests are penned in by locked doors, the room swiftly transforms into an H.R. Giger tableau: gooey masses of skin-stripped bodies cover the floor, so juicy you can almost hear the squish. It is a perverse and beautiful sight made even more unsettling by the sound of Perry's dying breaths. -- NQ",https://www.vulture.com/article/fall-of-the-house-of-usher-death-scenes-ranked.html,-1

A majority of American college students blame Hamas for the October 7 attack on Israel, and two-thirds describe the attack as an act of terrorism by Hamas, according to a Generation Lab poll of two- and four-year college students. The findings come as debates over the attack -- which killed more than 1,400 in Israel, and which prompted by an Israeli response killing more than 2,800 in Gaza -- have roiled college campuses across the county, with some students garnering national attention for blaming Israel's treatment of Palestinians for the attack. The poll finds 86 of college students saying they are aware of the October 7 attack on Israel. And of that share, 67 describe the attack as an act of terrorism by Hamas, versus 12 who see it as a justified act of resistance by Hamas. Another 21 describe it as something else other than an act of terrorism or resistance. More than half, 52, of the college students who say they are aware of the October 7 attack blame it on Hamas. Another 11 blame it on Israel, 12 blame it on other Middle Eastern governments and another 25 blame it on someone else. But respondents who are Democrats or who are students of color are less likely to blame Hamas for the attack than Republicans and white students are. By party, 73 of Republicans, 50 of Democrats and 50 of independents say they blame Hamas for the attack on Israel. And by race, 58 of white college students, 47 of Latinos and 36 of Black college students believe Hamas deserves blame for the attack.",https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-us-college-students-finds-blame-hamas-attack-israel-rcna120833,-1

Last week, the United States took a tougher stance on the Western sanctions against Russia. The YOU.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed last Thursday sanctions on two entities and identified as blocked property two vessels that used Price Cap Coalition service providers while carrying Russian crude oil above the Coalition-agreed price cap. The ceiling of 60 per barrel of Russian crude oil set by the G7 and the EU says that Russian crude shipments to third countries can use Western insurance and financing if cargoes are sold at or below the 60-a-barrel ceiling. The measure took effect at the end of 2022 when the EU imposed an embargo on imports of Russian crude oil. Thursday's sanction move was the first time the YOU.S. had imposed sanctions for a breach of the price cap. Today's action demonstrates our continued commitment to reduce Russia's resources for its war against Ukraine and to enforce the price cap, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said in a statement. As the sanctions spooked more tanker owners that abandoned the market of shipping Russian crude, the freight rates for transporting Russia's oil from its Baltic Sea ports to India have surged by 50 in just a few days, the trading sources told Reuters. Freight rates rose to some 7.5 million per voyage on Monday from 4.5 million-4.8 million last week, one source with a trading firm involved in Russian oil sales told Reuters.

The derailment occurred at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday as a southbound BNSF coal train crossed a bridge a mile south of the Purcell Boulevard exit, spilling the contents of at least six coal cars onto the highway, officials said. A 9-mile stretch of I-25 remained closed in both directions Monday morning, with the Colorado Department of Transportation warning of an extended closure. The Colorado State Patrol confirmed on Monday that the driver of a tractor-trailer, a 60-year-old California man, was killed in the incident. The truck was traveling northbound on I-25 and was crushed when the derailed cars fell from the overpass. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board are responding to the scene to investigate the accident, CSP public information officer Troy Kessler said. Sadly, this event is not surprising, the five lawmakers said in a joint statement. They included state Sen. Faith Winter of Thornton, the Senate assistant majority leader and chair of the Senate Transportation and Energy Committee, along with Sens. Lisa Cutter of Jefferson County, Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo, Sonya Jaquez Lewis of Longmont and Kevin Priola of Henderson. In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Gov. Jared Polis said that debris removal cannot begin until the NTSB gives the state clearance to proceed, and urged the agency to complete its work as soon as possible. Our immediate priority is safely getting the highway open both ways, Polis said. It is estimated that the debris removal phase could take as long as 48 hours, but I am ensuring that we are doing everything we can to complete it more quickly. YOU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Sunday that he had been in contact with Polis and federal rail officials regarding the incident. State and local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected, Buttigieg wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The derailment follows several other high-profile train accidents across the country in 2023, beginning with a derailment and chemical fire in East Palestine, Ohio, in February. Widespread concerns about the risks of a proposed oil train project in eastern Utah, which would dramatically increase hazardous materials shipments on Colorado railroads, have also put pressure on state lawmakers to address rail safety. In advance of the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers on the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee voted earlier this month to move forward with a bill to address numerous safety issues with our rail system in Colorado. It will likely include provisions to limit the length of trains and to require the installation of more trackside detectors to alert rail operators to equipment issues that pose derailment risks. Parts of the proposal mirror federal legislation that was introduced in the aftermath of the East Palestine disaster but has since stalled. Efforts on this legislation began in the immediate aftermath of the disastrous hazardous material train derailment in East Palestine, wrote lawmakers. Through the aftermath and investigation of that derailment, it became clear that our commercial rail transportation network has been subjected to ever increasing risk of accidents, with ever increasing severity when they do occur. Polis also said his administration is working to take advantage of the safety and rail investments funded by the 2021 congressional infrastructure law. Sadly, those improvements come too late to prevent this incident but it is clear that federal funds for rail support are critical for Colorado, the governor said.

NTSB spokesperson Sarah Sulick said investigators believe the broken rail preceded Sunday's derailment. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warnings systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, Sulick said. Numerous traffic detours remain in place as crews continue to work the scene of the train derailment. According to reports from Gazette news partner, KKTV, several trucks arrived on the scene Tuesday just before 8 a.m., awaiting mangled train tracks and coal to be picked up and cleared from the scene, with additional crews on standby. Local and state law enforcement officials remained, patrolling the area. Local and federal officials said cleanup from the incident is anticipated to take at least two days, once the process begins. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway continues to function as the primary entity dealing with the cleanup, response and reconstruction, officials said in a news release Monday. News Truck driver killed in train derailment near Pueblo identified; stretch of I-25 closed indefinitely The Associated Press and The Gazette BNSF estimates that clearing activities will take approximately two days, once the cleanup begins.

Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill this month that would have given grocery store workers who are laid off as a result of a merger or acquisition a week of severance pay for every year of their service. Advocates began pushing for the severance package since last fall, when Kroger and Albertsons announced plans for a massive merger. The 24.6 billion deal involving two of the largest grocery chains in the United States faces antitrust scrutiny but, if approved, it could happen in early 2024. In the Bay Area, Kroger operates Food 4 Less, Foods Co. and Ralph's, and Albertsons operates Albertsons and Safeway. The veto announced last week comes after the governor signed two other grocery worker protection bills.Newsom said he vetoed the bill -- Senate Bill 725 -- because other laws already protect these workers. He cited the state's Grocery Worker Retention law, which since 2016 has required companies that merge or buy another grocer to retain existing workers at least 90 days, and the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires companies with 100 or more workers to give them 60 days notice before mass layoffs. He also noted that affected workers could tap unemployment insurance. While the goal of limiting the disruptions caused by grocery mergers and acquisitions ... is laudable, existing law already provides protections for displaced workers, he said. The additional obligations in this bill are unduly prescriptive and overly burdensome. California could be among the states most affected by a Kroger and Albertsons merger. Kroger operates 233 stores under the Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co brands in California, and Albertsons operates 579 stores under the Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions names, according to a report by the Los Angeles research group, Economic Roundtable. Counting merger's costs In Los Angeles and Orange counties, 115 of 159 Albertsons stores are located within two miles of a Kroger store. The merger could result in 5,750 jobs lost in the Los Angeles region, according to the report. The union that represents many California grocery workers is raising alarms about the potential layoffs. The United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council said in a statement: A merger between these two companies could result in large-scale layoffs for workers, grocery stores closing down, particularly in food deserts and rural areas, increasing food costs, and a reduction in a variety of products, including seasonal, organic, and climate-friendly plant-based foods for consumers, The companies denied that, saying no frontline employees would lose their jobs, because the companies plan to sell hundreds of stores to CS Wholesale Grocers, which has agreed to maintain store jobs and bargaining agreements and may use the Albertsons name in California. Some grocery workers said they would feel more secure with legal protections. Judy Wood, a cake decorator at Albertsons who has worked in grocery stores for 36 years, said she feels let down by Newsom's veto. We were deemed essential workers during the pandemic and we stood behind our governor at that time, she said. We kept the food going to people if they needed it and we stood on those frontlines. We were subjected to COVID all the time. We were there for him during that time ... but he is not there for us now. Wood, 65, said she is nearing retirement and plans to leave California because living here is hard on her 21.02 hourly pay. 'Essential heroes' State Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, the Los Angeles Democrat who authored SB 725, said the governor's veto is disappointing. Without our bill, it leaves essential workers vulnerable to a potential merger, as a vast majority of these workers are already struggling to make ends meet for their families, she said. Hours before the veto, the United Food and Commercial Workers praised Newsom for signing two companion bills to strengthen protections of grocery store workers. Assembly Bill 853 will require grocery or drug store companies to notify the state attorney general 180 days before finalizing a proposed merger or acquisition, and to submit an impact analysis of the deal. The analysis would include effects on community food deserts, prices, the supply of experienced grocery workers, as well as unemployment, wages and benefits. Grocery workers have seen the effects of mergers and acquisitions in the industry -- from job loss to centers of their communities going dark, said Todd Walters, president, UFCW Local 135 in a statement. AB 853 will give California's decision makers the information needed to know just how proposed mergers in the grocery and drug-retail industries will affect their lives and can make an informed decision on the impact of mergers on our state. AB 647 will strengthen the state's existing Grocery Worker Retention Law, expanding its 90-day retention provision to include warehouse workers. And it includes stronger enforcement mechanisms, including giving grocers 33 days to resolve a violation before a worker can sue. Mark Ramos, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council, said he is grateful Newsom signed the two bills but worries the veto will mean displaced workers will not have enough money if the merger goes through. Noting that Newsom once called grocery workers essential heroes, he added, It makes me wonder, are heroes disposable?

Cooler weather and shorter days mean more deer are now crossing roadways. The number of deer-vehicle collisions increases during October and peaks in November and December. AAA East Central cautions motorists to be especially vigilant on the road to avoid costly and potentially dangerous crashes. More collisions between vehicles and deer occur now than any other time of the year, Jonathon King, vice president of Insurance sales, AAA East Central, said. One of our top claims as winter approaches is for vehicles that have been totaled from hitting animals, and the costs can be staggering. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are about 1 million car accidents with deer each year that kill 200 Americans, because more than 10,000 personal injuries and result in 1 billion in vehicle damage. The most dangerous times for collisions are dusk and dawn when deer are most active. Because of reduced visibility, these are the times when it is tougher for motorists to spot the animals. AAA's recommendation: Check your coverage. AAA Insurance reports that its average deer-related claim in the region is about 5,600, though costs can be much higher depending on the damage to a vehicle. This year's average is more than 600 higher than last year. Collision coverage pays for damage to a vehicle that results from a collision with an object (e.g., a telephone pole, a guard rail, a mailbox), or because of flipping over. AAA East Central recommends motorists opt-in for comprehensive coverage, which is for damage to vehicles covered by disasters other than collisions (in this case, contact with animals). While adding comprehensive coverage may add a small amount to your premium, it could save you money down the road, continued King. To help prevent a crash or to reduce damage from an animal collision, AAA suggests motorists: In the event of a deer strike, AAA recommends: Motorists should contact their insurance agent or company representative as quickly as possible to report any damage.",https://bulletinreporter.com/aaa-this-is-peak-time-of-year-for-deer-collisions/,-1

A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The accident remains under investigation.",https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/nation_and_world/business/broken-rail-caused-fatal-colorado-train-derailment-that-collapsed-bridge-early-findings-show/article_d63c9fc3-9817-5e2a-a797-7bad4a044609.html,-1

Nadezhda Oleneva, 38, went missing Saturday after slipping and falling deep into a crevasse. Kathmandu, Nepal: Rescuers in Nepal confirmed Tuesday the death of a well-known Russian climber on Mount Dhaulagiri, the world's seventh-highest peak, but bad weather prevented the recovery of her body. Nadezhda Oleneva, 38, went missing Saturday after slipping and falling deep into a crevasse at an altitude of around 6,700 metres (nearly 22,000 feet). She had been climbing to the summit along with two other mountaineers. All three were attempting to scale the peak without supplemental oxygen or the support of guides. She was spotted on Sunday but now snow has covered the area. A long-line operation could not retrieve her body, Iswari Paudel, managing director of Himalayan Guides Nepal, told AFP.

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said a few hours before Biden was set to take off that the trip would be rescheduled.

West was due to perform at the open-air venue in Reggio Emilia on Friday and organisers had been in talks with local authorities about the gig all last week. Initially it had been due to take place on October 20 but with 100,000 fans expected and a rail strike planned for the Italian network it was decided to postpone the event. Officials also took into account that heavy rain is forecast in the area on Friday evening and with no shelter, the open-air venue risked becoming a mud bath. A spokesperson for the Reggio Emilia prefecture said:'Given the fact that a rail strike was planned the same day, and that heavy rain is due it was thought prudent to postpone the event. EXCLUSIVE: Kanye West's controversial Italian gig - set to take place on Friday - has been postponed following protests from war veterans who have slammed him for praising Hitler Will still go ahead: 'The organisers have been given an alternative date of October 27 and we are waiting to hear back if it is acceptable to them' 'Our aim to ensure the safety and security of all and if there is a transport issue then the concert cannot go ahead safely and as it is open air the heavy rain forecast would have also created problems. 'The organisers have been given an alternative date of October 27 and we are waiting to hear back if it is acceptable to them.' Security is expected to be tight as MailOnline highlighted how local veterans' groups were angry the gig was even being touted because of West's praise for Adolf Hitler and Nazism. In a shock interview last year West said: 'Every human being has something of value they brought to the table, especially Hitler. 'I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis. There is a lot of things that I love about Hitler, a lot of things, I like Hitler, I am a Nazi.' Albertina Soliani, vice president of (ANPI) National Association of Italian Partisans, stormed: 'It is time to say enough to these people who believe they can say what they want. 'Someone can be a fantastic singer but then they are also judged by what they say, and West has made some inhumane declarations and with what is happening in the world today we cannot accept this concert. 'We are focused every day with carrying certain values, which are liberty and democracy and then with this we just have to start again from the beginning. In an interview last year West said: 'Every human being has something of value they brought to the table, especially Hitler (Kanye pictured arriving at Milan fashion week in September) His love: West - who has now changed his name to Ye - has been in Italy on an extended holiday with his wife Australian Bianca Censori since August 'In my opinion he should stay at home, Reggio Emilia has always appreciated people who have fought for determine principles and we are on the side of the oppressed and not those who preach hate.' Ermete Fiaccadori, ANPI regional president for Reggio Emilia, blasted West and said: 'First of all let me just say that I hope this concert does not go ahead, this artist has a large following of youngsters, but his message is disquieting. 'I am speechless that he cannot understand what he Is saying, broadcasting a gross misunderstanding of what Adolf Hitler was in the course of history. 'I am all for artistic liberty but what Kanye West says and does leave me shocked. READ MORE: Kanye West 'instructs' his 'wife' Bianca Censori to 'NEVER speak' Advertisement 'As an organisation we condemn this concert totally and we are very concerned about what message it conveys. 'And before anyone says it, this is not censorship because we are all in favour of liberty, but we are talking about a concert that is totally out of order. 'Reggio has a long history of fighting against the ideas of Adolf Hitler, and many lost their lives as a result.' West, 46, has been in Italy with Australian Italian wife Bianca Censori, 28, since August and is said to be working on a new album at a recording studio in Milan. In March 1944, at Cervarolo, just 40 miles from Reggio Emilia, the Nazis butchered 24 people including the village priest in retaliation for partisan activity. In a hard-hitting editorial on its website ReggioOnline blasted the idea of the gig saying: 'Do we really want this?' and highlighted how the star has been involved in controversy since being in Italy. It added: 'West is capable of selling thousands of tickets in just a few minutes, of moving an enormous amount of money, of creating an event that will reach millions of people overnight through streaming. 'Is it right that Kayne West sings in Reggio Emilia in the name of art and its ability to attract a large audience? 'This is a city that takes its students to see the extermination camps on memory trips so that those atrocities are never repeated again. 'This is a city in which the values of the person, of human dignity, and of respect for others are not questioned and are also remembered. 'This is the city where children are not sent to ovens to burn but are exalted through an education system that the world copies from us. 'In the name of money, many justifications can be put on the table: from the phrase if he did not sing in Reggio, he would sing elsewhere to the more subtle one: all artists sing questionable phrases. Not happy: Local veterans' groups representing former partisans who fought against the Nazis and Hitler as well as Italian dictator Benito Mussolini have blasted the concert Big project: Trucks have been coming and going from the RCF Arena at Reggio Emilia near Bologna for several days and on Thursday a private jet landed at a nearby airstrip and a car with blacked out windows was seen heading to the venue 'If West performs in Reggio Emilia, he will certainly fall within the logic of a market that does not look at what is sung but at what it produces. 'However, do not forget that words, in addition to producing money, when they are dangerous and violent, produce damage to the brains of many people. But this is obviously of little or no interest.' Last year West brought out an album called Donda which was named after his mother, and he is said to be in Italy working on the follow up. Music forums suggested the concert if not given the go ahead will be a 'listening event' where instead of performing in front of a live audience it would be streamed online. Donda - which was West's 10th album - was named after his mother Donda C West who died in 2007 aged just 58. West last performed live in Italy in August when he appeared before 60,000 fans at a Travs Scott gig in Rome - and it was his first appearance since making a stream of anti-Semitic comments. Dressed all in black and barefoot West sang Praise God from Donda as well as his 2007 anthem Cannot Tell Me Nothing. That concert hit the headlines after 60 people needed hospital treatment when pepper spray was let off, while locals feared an earthquake as jumping fans triggered intense vibrations registering 1.3 magnitude.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12640013/Kanye-Wests-controversial-Italian-gig-postponed-following-protests-war-veterans-slammed-praising-Hitler.html,-1

Crews are working to clear toppled train cars and spilled coal at the the derailment site near the city of Pueblo, which lies about 45 miles south of Colorado Springs, the Colorado State Patrol said. The train operator, BNSF Railway, said its personnel are assisting in the cleanup. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has begun its investigation at the scene, where 30 train cars derailed and caused a partial bridge collapse. Images of the scene posted online by the state patrol show several cars toppled over the side of the bridge and nearby embankment, blanketing the ground with coal. A semi-tractor trailer passing underneath the bridge at the time of the collapse became trapped between the bridge and coal cars, the federal agency said Monday. The male driver of the truck was killed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler told CNN. No other details on the victim were provided. There were no reported injuries among BNSF crew members, the rail company said. The interstate closure extends approximately 12 miles beginning at Exit 100B in Pueblo and extending northward to Exit 110, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. Both northbound and southbound lanes remained closed as of Monday evening. This will be an extended closure. Drivers heading between Pueblo and Colorado Springs must detour, the transportation department said in a closure notice. The National Transportation Safety Board said a preliminary investigation report is expected to be completed within 30 days. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said he has communicated with Colorado Governor Jared Polis about the incident and has been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway Administrations. US Department of Transportation staff were headed to the scene Sunday night, he said. State  local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected, Buttigieg said.

Summary Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc distinguished itself from future entries with a darker and more grounded tone, resulting in arguably the most intense story in the series. The canceled prototype of the game, Distrust, featured a grittier aesthetic and realistic, graphic violence unlike the stylized horror of Trigger Happy Havoc. While Trigger Happy Havoc's cast may not be as lively, their paranoia and constant sense of dread add to the game's atmosphere, making it brilliantly evocative of fear and suspicion. This article contains spoilers for Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. It is been nearly 13 years since Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc kickstarted the series' captivating killing games, but fans have not forgotten its creative murder mysteries, thrilling class trials, and gruesome executions. Despite their bleak premises and often tragic stories, the Danganronpa games are known for their zany humor and endearingly eccentric characters like the malicious robotic mascot, Monokuma. Danganronpa's balance of life-or-death stakes and unpredictable comedy kept players simultaneously entertained and horrified with every entry. While the series' humor and horror continued to escalate with each installment, leading to both the most hilarious and most shocking moments in the franchise, many fans still appreciate the first game and the ways it distinguished itself from future entries. While it may be difficult to pin down at first, Trigger Happy Havoc features a noticeably more grounded tone and presentation compared to its predecessors. For those who are more familiar with the sunny beaches of Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair or even the darker, sci-fi campus of Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, returning to Trigger Happy Havoc's pristine hallways and claustrophobic classrooms can be a jarring experience. The first game's darker atmosphere and subdued comedy resulted in arguably the most intense story in the series. While this was partially a sign of the series' early struggles to settle on a specific tone, Trigger Happy Havoc's bleakness was heavily influenced by the canceled prototype that led to Danganronpa's creation. Danganronpa's Beta was a Much Darker Game Prior to the development of Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa started out as a different game titled Distrust. This early prototype centered around a killing game in which 15 high school students were forced to murder each other without being caught. After a body is discovered, the surviving students participate in a class trial to uncover the identity of the killer, with players answering questions and presenting evidence in a manner similar to the gameplay of the Ace Attorney series. All this will sound familiar to anybody who is played Trigger Happy Havoc or its sequels, but Distrust presented this basic premise through a much darker vision. Early concepts for Distrust featured a grittier and significantly more grounded aesthetic than the final release. The version of Hope's Peak Academy seen in the prototype is a seemingly abandoned facility with rusted metallic walls and furniture strewn about its classrooms. Class trials also took place in an empty, bloodstained warehouse rather than the circular courtroom seen in the Danganronpa games. This dirty, industrial setting gave Distrust a cold and unsettling aesthetic reminiscent of gore-filled horror movies like Saw. However, the most significant visual difference between Distrust and Danganronpa is in their contrasting depictions of violence. Although Trigger Happy Havoc is full of butchered bodies and grisly kills, its signature pink blood and exaggerated executions lend the game a stylized horror that the game's director and lead writer, Kazutaka Kodaka, coined as psychopop. In contrast, Distrust portrays death in realistic and graphic detail. Early screenshots depicted brutal death scenes such as students being beheaded with a guillotine or impaled by spikes. Additionally, the prominent focus on bright red blood and gory details during these scenes highlight the prototype's goal of shocking players with disturbing visuals and unsettling circumstances. Distrust was also planned to include multiple game mechanics that were scrapped for Trigger Happy Havoc. Many of these indicate that Distrust might have been less linear than the final release, such as the seven-day time limit or the option to play through the story as any of the 15 students. Additionally, the game featured a trustdistrust mechanic that allowed player choices to impact their relationship with other characters and consequentially influence the events of the story (similar to the AllyBetray mechanic featured in another Spike-Chunsoft visual novel: Virtue's Last Reward). With these mechanics, it is likely that Distrust would have featured multiple different endings and allowed each student to become a potential killer or victim. Despite their tonal differences, Trigger Happy Havoc kept many story elements from Distrust, specifically in its first chapter. In both titles, Leon Kuwata (originally named Kazuo Matsuzaki in Distrust) is the killing game's first killer, and his execution scene is almost identical between the beta and final release. Additionally, Trigger Happy Havoc's first victim, Sayaka Maizano, was featured prominently in the concept art for Distrust. One of these art pieces showed her attacking Leon with a blade, which may have inspired her failed murder attempt in Trigger Happy Havoc. Besides serving as an outline for the first trial, this shared storyline also ensured the harshness of Distrust carried over into Trigger Happy Havoc. Trigger Happy Havoc Keeps the Atmosphere of Distrust While Danganronpa is famous for its memorable characters, Trigger Happy Havoc's cast is not as lively or endearing as the students of future entries. Some players might view this as a detriment to the game's story, but the less personable cast ultimately adds to its harsh atmosphere. Unlike the closely knit casts of later installments, the first game's students remain paranoid and cautious of each other up until the final trial. Every part of the game is defined by a constant sense of dread and suspense as players attempt to uncover the culprit behind each grisly murder or wait until the next killer strikes. There are still occasional moments of levity and a few friendships that form among the students, but these are often short-lived. Trigger Happy Havoc is especially brilliant in the ways it evokes fear and paranoia within players. Aside from the optional free time events, there is rarely a chance to learn about the lives and personalities of the individual characters. It can be difficult to determine which characters should be trusted, leading players to believe that any of them could become the next killer. Additionally, each murder primes players to be wary of the other students, with most murders in the game involving violent betrayals and misplaced trust. Not all of Trigger Happy Havoc's murder cases are difficult to solve, but the suspicion surrounding every member of the cast can lead players to doubt their initial guesses, resulting in class trials that remain captivating even when the player believes they have solved the mystery. Even Trigger Happy Havoc's presentation is partially influenced by the realistic violence of Distrust. Danganronpa's executions are far from grounded, and its signature pink blood softens the blow of the horrific death scenes. However, Trigger Happy Havoc never becomes as cartoonish as its sequels, and the execution methods are just grounded enough to be somewhat believable (apart from Mondo being turned into butter). Characters are impaled by spikes, bludgeoned by baseballs, burned at the stake, or crushed by a trash compactor. Each of these executions is portrayed with Danganronpa's exaggerated style, but their straightforward methods make each death seem nightmarishly real. The psychological horror and graphic violence that defined Distrust undoubtedly shaped Trigger Happy Havoc into the title that fans love today. However, by balancing these darker elements with a colorful art style and memorable cast, Danganronpa set itself apart from other visual novels in a way that Distrust could have never accomplished. No other series can replicate the emotional thrill rides that define Danganronpa, and the vibrant psychopop visuals are the perfect match for its irreverent tone. Trigger Happy Havoc may not possess the same degree of unpredictable outlandishness and eccentric charm that fans now associate with the franchise, but its roots in Distrust helped it deliver the most nail-biting narrative in the series.",https://www.cbr.com/canceled-danganronpa-prototype-trigger-happy-havoc-similarities/,-1

Two major container carriers - CMA CGM and Maersk - have advised customers that direct service to the port of Manaus is suspended until further notice. The port, the main transport hub for the upper Amazon basin, ison the Rio Negro, near where it meets the Solimoes River to form the Amazon. Monday's reading on the port's website shows the lowest water level since records were established in 1902, with the water still receding further. Some communities further up the river are virtually cut off from transport services as the water has become too shallow for navigation. A barge that was moving trucks and empty gas tanks has been stuck on a sandbank since last month. The federal government has set up a task force to mitigate the impact of the severe droughthitting the region, and move emergency supplies of water, food and medicine to the affected communities. It has also allocated BRL41m (8.2m) for dredging to re-enable navigation on the river. However, the state government of Amazonas is preparing for what is believed to be the worst drought the region has experienced. and it is exacerbated by the El Nio phenomenon and by the warmer waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which produce air currents that obstruct the formation of rain clouds. According to one report, as many as 90 of the regular vessels on the river are now operating with some kind of restriction in Amazonas, and the state has called for cargo capacity to be halved. This is affecting the movement of supplies to the region and its exports, from grain to mobile phones and other consumer electronics produced in the large free trade zone in Manaus. And officials have warned of possible disruptions to grain exports. On Friday, CMA CGM alerted customers that the conditions have reached an alarming level, limiting container vessel accessto the port. It added: As a result, CMA CGM has no other option than to divert its vessels on the Manaus Shuttle Service to other ports. Vessels would instead discharge cargo for Manaus and Vila do Conde at the ports of Pecem and Fortaleza. Earlier the container line had announced a lowwater surcharge in Manaus from 25 September of 750 per teu, rising to 1,100 per teu from 25 October. Marsk has also informed its clients of contingency plans to cope with the worsening conditions on the Amazon. It said: Our feeder provider Alianca declared force majeure, and the cargo on board vessels bound for Manaus will be discharged in alternative ports. And the container lines cannot make predictions when cargo can return to Manaus.CMA CGM said: The weather conditions that generated these restrictions are unstable, which does not allow us to accurately provide a forecast of improvement. Cargo onboard these vessels will be shipped to Manaus as soon as the water level allows. As water levels were still declining yesterday, there seems little hope of improvement in the near future. Observers expect the drought to last longer than usual, pointing to adverse weather and smoke from wildfires in the Amazon region. Some predictions are for the rainfall deficit in the region to last until the latter half of December,possibly into next year. This raises the possibility of further shipping restrictions in the area, which would send freight rates higher still. For now, Maersk offers a limited alternative transport option that combines truck and barge service between Vila do Conde and Manaus. This does not apply to hazardous and refrigerated cargo.",https://theloadstar.com/drought-and-low-amazon-water-levels-prevent-liner-access-to-manaus/,-1

The risk of becoming ill after contact with flood water is generally low. However, as it is not always clear whether flood water is contaminated, you should assume that it is and take appropriate precautions. Preventing health problems There are a number of things you can do to prevent health problems if your home floods: wherever possible try to avoid coming into direct contact with floodwater do not let children play in floodwater use rubber gloves when cleaning up wash hands after being in contact with flood water, sewage or anything contaminated by these wash children's hands regularly clean toys that have been in flood water with disinfectant cover cuts or open sores do not eat any food that has been in contact with floodwater clean all surfaces with disinfectant before any food is placed on them Contact your GP if you, or someone you know, develops a stomach upset following flooding.

Last year, Switzerland started to release oil from its emergency reserves as it lowered the obligatory levels of petroleum stocks by 6.5 due to low water levels on the Rhine River and chaos in railway transportation. In 2022, heat waves and droughts in many parts of Europe drained the water levels at the biggest navigational rivers, including the Rhine. The Rhine River, which runs northwest from Switzerland through Germany, France, and the Netherlands into the North Sea, is a major petroleum product transportation corridor in Europe. Switzerland gets petroleum supplies via two key routes -- via the Rhine and through railway transport. Low water levels on the Rhine in 2022 led to a drastic reduction in the amount of products shipped on the river, while the cross-border railway traffic to Switzerland saw massive cancellations and delays due to a lack of personnel and ongoing repair works. In a statement today, the Swiss government said that the fuel supply situation has returned to normal and sufficient volumes of fuel are now arriving in the country. The government noted that Switzerland felt an acute shortage of fuels in the autumn of 2022, due to issues with navigation on the Rhine and with bottlenecks in railway transportation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine also rattled the fuel market in Europe and Swiss imports were limited due to the spike in prices. Switzerland had issues with fuel supply early this year, too. The prolonged strikes in France hampered the delivery of jet fuel and only limited volumes of crude oil were delivered to the Cressier refinery in Switzerland. However, the fuel supply situation has improved in recent months, allowing the government to repeal the ordinance for stock draws, the cabinet said on Tuesday.",https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Switzerland-Stops-Strategic-Fuel-Stock-Drawdowns-As-Supply-Normalizes.html,-1

These are some of the global economy's weakest links.","The modern world has not freed itself from distance and geography; it still relies on a network of vulnerable physical links -- Deutsche Bank strategists The seas, skies, roads, pipes and space. The world's economy is riding on these physical links whose either accidental or deliberate disruption could roil the global economy, say a team of Deutsche Bank strategists -- Adrian Cox, Jim Reid and Galina Pozdnyakova. And global impact from wars in Ukraine and now Israel are magnified because of their strategic position near vital choke points, they say. A case in point was the recent between Finland and Estonia which stirred memories of sabotage to the Nord Stream gas pipeline from Russia to Germany a year ago which was destroyed by an explosion. Investors know of the vulnerable nodes, such as Taiwan's semiconductor fabs, or the 0.5 of subway stations in London and Paris, whose failure could bring down half of the network, say the analysts. However, they have come up with five less visible threats that they think are not being considered, and where an obvious alternative is not readily available, such as happened when a container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in 2021. 1.) Pipes and cables. Around 99 of international digital communications and 10 trillion in financial transactions daily pass through 550 active and planned fiber-optic cables that stretch 1.4 million kilometers. Many are barely thicker than a garden hose, and damage to just one of those could, for example, disrupt internet for millions. Buried in remote locations in international waters and outside of regulatory oversight, some have broken accidentally in the past, but others are vulnerable to espionage and sabotage. Then there are the undersea power cables, gas pipelines and oil pipelines to worry about. 2.) Roads, rails and rivers. The Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia are Africa's biggest copper producers and account for two-thirds of the world's cobalt that is transported on four poorly maintained major roads. Brazil, the No. 1 soybean exporter, relies as well on four ports and small roads. Sparsity of global rail systems is also a risk, while rivers are vulnerable to drought. The Rhine, Mississippi, and Yangtze have all seen crisis in recent years, with drinking water and hydroelectricity at times affected. 3.) Sea straights. While oceans cover 70 of the earth's surface, just eight maritime chokepoints are used to pass oil, crops and container cargoes. More than 60 of oil supplies moves via sea, often through the vital Strait of Hormuz between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Food trade, meanwhile, is concentrated through the Panama Canal and wheat through the Turkish Straits, while fertilizers run through a handful of vital straits. These chokepoints are at risk from collisions, terrorist attacks, blockades, wars and accidents. Alternative routes can take days to figure out, add the analysts. 4.) Air corridors. Deutsche Bank wants clients to think about an invisible network of routes, vulnerable to war, weather and air-traffic control strikes, with the biggest routes contained in a few major cities. And the top 20 global airports are responsible for 42 of total cargo traffic. In 2010, the biggest air-traffic shutdown since World War Two was caused by the eruption of an Icelandic volcano. 5.) Space satellites. A scattering of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are at the heart of communications and location-based technology, but the YOU.S.'s Global Positioning System (GPS) is a big player, too big some say. Among the vital functions, satellites send signals to GPS chips in phones for 4 billion military and civilian users worldwide. The hardware is vulnerable to space debris, space storms and sabotage, and alternatives to YOU.S. GPS systems are actively being sought by other nations and companies.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cables-the-sky-and-sea-these-are-some-of-the-global-economys-weakest-links-c7a29aa0,-1

The incident was reported at around 1:30 pm local time on Tuesday (17 Oct). This unfortunate event involved two trains: the Argo Semeru and the Argo Wilis. Nevo, a member of the Kulon Progo fire brigade, shared details when interviewed at the scene on Tuesday (17 Oct). According to reports from passengers and Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) officers, the accident began when the Argo Semeru train, travelling from Surabaya to Jakarta, suddenly derailed. Simultaneously, the Argo Wilis train, on its journey from Bandung to Surabaya, collided with the rear of the Argo Semeru carriage. Nevo explained, The Argo Semeru, en route from Surabaya to Jakarta, derailed, leading to the collision with the tail of the Argo Semeru by the Argo Wilis from Bandung to Surabaya. Fortunately, the latest information indicates that there were no fatalities in this incident, only injuries. An X account shared a video showing the condition of the derailed Argo Semeru and its subsequent collision with the Argo Wilis train. Meanwhile, anthocyanin, through his X account, described the sequence of events they experienced during the accident, including the initial shaking of the train and the eventual collision. I was sitting calmly when the train suddenly began to shake. At first, I assumed it was just the usual minor vibrations, as trains tend to sway a bit. However, it quickly became clear that something was amiss when glasses started falling. After a while, I heard a loud crash, and it seemed like the roof might collapse. The account went on to say, Fortunately, my carriage remained upright. From the first executive carriage to the rear, the train had actually overturned. I am relieved to report that I am perfectly fine. Thank goodness I am unharmed. The dhika.phex X account reported that passengers had started to be evacuated using the Yogyakarta International Airport (YIA) train heading to Wates station. The Indonesian Red Cross of Kulon Progo Regency reported that while nine train passengers suffered light, moderate, and severe injuries, there were no fatalities. One injured passenger was transported to the Wates Regional General Hospital for further treatment, while others received on-site medical attention. Currently, eight carriages of the Argo Semeru train, bound for Bandung-Gubeng (Surabaya) from Yogyakarta, have derailed. Meanwhile, hundreds of passengers from both trains have been evacuated to Wates Station while awaiting further instructions from PT Kereta Api Indonesia. In a press release issued by PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) via its official Twitter account on Tuesday (17 Oct), they apologized for the service disruption due to the derailment of Argo Semeru, the Surabaya Gubeng - Gambir connection, and Argo Wilis, connecting Bandung - Surabaya Gubeng. KAI is currently making efforts to evacuate passengers on the two trains that were involved in this incident, said Raden Agus Dwinanto Budiadji, KAI Executive Vice President of Corporate Secretary. The next step for KAI is to evacuate the passengers and repair the damaged rail lines. Both rail lines between Wates and Sentolo are temporarily impassable due to the accident. For train journeys passing through the Wates - Sentolo area, KAI will work on creating alternative operational patterns, including detours and temporary stoppages.",https://gutzy.asia/2023/10/17/train-collision-on-sentolo-rail-line-in-yogyakarta-indonesia-no-fatalities-reported/,-1

On Friday, The Sunshine Blog and just about every media outlet in the country that has been covering the Maui fires was surprised to see an Associated Press story recounting 911 calls made by panicked and desperate residents of Lahaina pleading for help from emergency officials as flames were looming on the edge of town. Surprised because we all had submitted public records requests weeks ago for the 911 tapes. So why were they only released to one outfit, the AP? Who knows. Civil Beat could not even get ahold of anyone in the communications department to ask WTF until late Friday. And then we were told the same tapes that the AP got would be released to everyone else on Monday morning. Well, that did not happen. Now they say the request is with Corp Counsel for review. But did not they already release it? So what is to review? The Blog is so confused. Meanwhile, Maui communications chief Mahina Martin decided to use the county's Facebook account to apologize for releasing the tapes and blame it on the insensitive media. Numerous commenters immediately called her out though, rightly pointing out that the only way the public is going to know how well -- or not -- Maui County responded to the emergency that was engulfing the town was by hearing for themselves how it was playing out. Of course, not everyone thinks the tapes should have been released and other commenters sided with Martin. All valid concerns and over the next few days the debate became as much about Maui County and its response to the fires as it was about the media and the public airing of the 911 tapes. But, as one commenter pointed out, it should not be any surprise that news organizations would request the tapes, as they have done for every major disaster including fires in the country for years. So what are we missing here? If it is not a surprise to most people that 911 tapes are required to be made public and that it is a common practice and that many people welcome their release, why is the county still stalling? Bye bye birdie?: Local tech guy and media whiz Ryan Ozawa is urging Gov. Josh Green and Mayor Rick Blangiardi to order state and city agencies to cease and desist when it comes to using Twitter (now called X) for communicating to the public. In a letter last week to the governor and the mayor, Ozawa argues that the social media platform is not a good place to be these days. Twitter (or 'X') is no longer a reliable medium to provide civic and official information, and further, driving traffic to the site is supporting its current policies -- which monetize disinformation and do not moderate hate speech, CSAM, harassment, and other dangerous content, Ozawa writes. Specifically, he directs the political leaders attention to media reports about misinformation that is spread on Twitter most recently about the attacks on Israel and Gaza, and articles critical of how Elon Musk has changed the platform since he took it over. Ozawa also wants Twitter icons removed from government web pages and notes that at least one local government -- in Kansas -- has already done this. It bears noting that Twitter has remarkably low engagement overall, and delivers almost negligible traffic already. Such a change will have minimal practical impact, but significant moral impact, Ozawa says. The Sunshine Blog long ago gave up on social media including XTwitter for anything but cute cat videos. Motion commotion: Speaking of cats, the Democratic Party of Hawaii's State Central Committee held a contentious Zoom call Saturday that ran well over four hours. By the time it was finished the committee managed to schedule a special meeting for October 28 to decide the fate of embattled chair Dennis Jung, who is aggressively fighting a concerted effort to remove him over allegations of mismanagement. There will also be another election at that time for the party's vice chair and assistant secretary, as candidates for those seats were challenged by some Democrats. Bill Puette, the party's parliamentarian, is so upset with the dispute between Jung and State Central Committee members that he quit his post. It is been said that getting Democrats to unify is like herding cats, but the local party is looking a lot more like elephants these days. Food for thought: Your Sunshine Blogger sat through the Hawaii Economic Association's conference at the Halekulani late last week, which featured plenty of expert panelists. They had some very interesting thoughts to share. This sounds like heresy, but we really do need a vibrant opposition party, former Gov. John Waihee told the group, adding that otherwise the majority party is consumed by personality politics. Waihee, a Democrat, reminded the audience that it was Republicans who led the charge to establish Hawaiian homelands (Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole), open up Asian immigration to the YOU.S. (Sen. Hiram Fong) and stop the military bombing of Kahoolawe (Rep. Pat Saiki). But the focus of today's local GOP, Waihee said, is unfortunately not on Hawaii. Writer and researcher Tom Coffman noted that Gov. Jack Burns' 1970 campaign was the first time a candidate spent over 1 million. But it was also the time when the Hawaii Carpenters Union fund was formed and when Hawaii saw the emergence of trade union leader Walter Kupau. What followed was a pattern of groups such as contractors giving more and more contributions to politicians. The only way to move away from what Coffman called a two-handed process that keeps a lot of the same people in power -- and which invariably leads to corruption -- is real campaign finance reform. Lori Kahikina, executive director and CEO of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, said she was shocked to learn how political the rail agency was. Actually, I think the main reason HART was formed was to keep politics out of it, she said. Kahikina said she also held nearly 90 speaking engagements last year, no matter how small the audience, to get the word out on her work at HART. And yet, media criticism was constant and negative. She learned the style of the various reporters and decided that she would not talk to those who would twist my words and be so negative. Kahikina did not identify the reporters but astute Civil Beat readers know that she has been infamously less than forthcoming with Civil Beat reporters while gushing over TV hosts. City and County of Television: Ryan Wilson, formerly of Hawaii News Now, is now a communications officer for the Honolulu mayor's office. The move reunites Wilson with other HNN veterans Scott Humber and Ian Scheuring and of course Rick Blangiardi himself. Another TV veteran, Brandi Higa (formerly of KITV), is also part of the comms team.

The news emerged on the same day that several airlines, including SWISS and Lufthansa, suspended flights to Lebanon in light of the deteriorating security situation in the region that has seen clashes on the border between Lebanon and Israel. MEA is yet to publicly confirm that it has moved some of its planes out of Beirut to avoid them becoming collateral damage in the event that the airport is targeted, but flight records would indicate there might be some truth to the reports. In recent days, several aircraft have been flown from Beirut to Istanbul under an irregular flight number and have not moved since. These include s 14-year-old Airbus A330, which was ferried to Turkey on October 13, and three Airbus A321neo jets which were flown to Istanbul on October 13 and October 15. In what is believed to be a leaked internal memo, the airline told staffers that the aircraft was not expecting any disruption to its normal flight schedule as a result of moving the aircraft because they are currently surplus to requirements as the arline enters its winter low season. The authenticity of the memo has not been verified. MEA has previously moved its spare aircraft out of harm's way, most notably in the run-up to the 2006 Lebanon War when Israeli warplanes bombed three runways at Beirut Airport. Last week, Israel launched a dual assault on Damascus and Aleppo Airports in Syria, damaging the runways and putting the airfields out of action. MEA Airlines is, unfortunately, no stranger to having its aircraft damaged by deadly weaponry, although the damage is normally caused by accident by small arms fire. On New Year's Eve, two parked planes at Beirut Airport were reportedly hit by stray bullets as locals in the vicinity of the airport celebrated the start of 2023 by firing guns into the same air. And in November 2022, similar celebrations resulted in a packed MEA plane being hit by stray bullet as it came into land at Beirut Airport. Thankfully no one was injured, although the incident was condemned by local officials who called on residents in the vicinity of the airport to stop firing guns into the air.",https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2023/10/17/lebanons-national-flag-carrier-moves-planes-out-of-beirut-over-fears-airport-could-be-targeted-as-middle-east-tensions-rise/,-1

On affected bikes that were made early in the production of both models, a lower frame rail clamp may not keep the rear brake line in place. As a result, the rear brake line could come in contact with the exhaust, which could lead to a brake fluid leak. Subsequent loss of braking power could increase the rider's risk of a crash. Affected 2023 FLHXSE (CVO Street Glide) and FLTRXSE (CVO Road Glide) bikes were produced between May 10, 2023 and September 6, 2023. On September 6, 2023, Harley-Davidson placed a production hold on the lines of both bikes, and on September 13, 2023, a revised clamp was introduced to the production line. Bikes produced after the affected dates are not impacted by this recall because an improved part is now in use. According to Harley's records, around 930 CVO Street Glides and 1,282 CVO Road Glides are believed to be affected by this recall. A total of 2,212 bikes are potentially believed to be involved, representing around one percent of the population. Warning signs that could occur include either a rider or a motorcycle technician noticing that the rear brake line is not in the position that it should be in, going between the rear brake caliper and the rear brake master cylinder. Additionally, riders or technicians could notice damage to the rear brake line, or potentially brake fluid either oozing or on the floor underneath the bike. While Harley-Davidson notes that it has received three field reports so far relating to this issue, none of them have involved crashes or injuries. For the production time period between September 6, 2023 and September 13, 2023, Harley inspected the bikes and used a secondary retention strap to keep the brake line in place before introducing the revised and corrected part on September 13, 2023. Harley-Davidson officially sent notification to its dealership network between October 10 and October 13, 2023 regarding this recall. Owners will be notified between October 16 and October 20, 2023. Owners of affected 2023 Harley-Davidson CVO Street Glide and CVO Road Glide motorcycles should arrange for recall service with their local authorized Harley-Davidson dealer. Technicians will replace the rear brake line clamp with an updated part, free of charge. Harley-Davidson's number for this recall is 0184. Owners can contact Harley-Davidson customer service at 1-800-258-2464. Additionally, owners can contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or visit www.nhtsa.gov.

He said the Jakarta-Surabaya route could pass through Cirebon and Semarang and end in Surabaya. If it is extended from Jakarta-Bandung to Surabaya, the project will be even more chaotic. What will be the next station or region after Bandung? Faisal said in a discussion on the debt burden of the country's first high-speed train project in the State Budget at Paramadina University, South Jakarta, on Tuesday, October 17, 2023. According to him, the route via Cirebon and Semarang is more economically feasible as the two cities already have purchasing power. Looking at the route in a straight line, the distance from Jakarta to Surabaya is approximately 663 kilometers, so the bullet train could be an alternative to air transport, rather than toll road-based public transport. Faisal mentioned that a trip from Jakarta to Surabaya by plane could take up to half a day. By a high-speed train, it could take only 2.5 hours. That is very superior. The train could end at Turi Market, for example. It is very close to the central city of Surabaya, Faisal argued. He also said the Jakarta-Surabaya high-speed train route is similar to the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed train route. However, the US17 billion project was canceled even though there were more than 30,000 flights annually between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, making it the world's busiest international route. A professor of transportation from UI, Sutanto Soehodho, seconded Faisal Basri's statement. He opined that the Jakarta-Surabaya high-speed train route via Java's northern route (Pantura) has more economic value than via the southern coast. The northern route could also attract more riders. The Pantura passes through several cities that are more developed in terms of economic activity, Sutanto told Tempo on Monday, October 9, 2023. MOH.

One of them is the world's cables and pipes system, including data cables, undersea power cables, gas pipelines, and oil pipelines, which are vulnerable to espionage, sabotage, and accidental or environmental damage. The second is the system of roads, rails, and rivers, which are vulnerable to drought and flood, among other destructive occurrences. China has made the biggest investment in rail and road infrastructure since 2021, as part of their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) program, launched a decade ago. It financed about 1T of infrastructure in six economic corridors across Eurasia and Africa. The YOU.S. has followed with a plan for an India-Middle East Europe Corridor (IMEC) in September to compete with BRI. The third system is the sea straits, including the Dover Strait, the Strait of Gibraltar, the Panama Canal, the Cape of Good Hope, the Suez Canal, the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, the Turkish Straits, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Strait of Malacca. The Strait of Hormuz is the most important oil chokepoint, carrying around a fifth of the world's total oil consumption. Blockages, collisions, grounding, piracy, wars, and shipping accidents such as oil spills are some of its vulnerabilities. The latest example of a blockage was the Ever Given container ship stuck at the Suez Canal in March 2021, holding up almost 9.6B of goods every day it was stuck. Air corridors are the fourth physical link. These are an invisible network of routes vulnerable to weather and international conflict. Twenty airports represent 42 of the total volume of world cargo. The airport with the biggest cargo in metric tonnes is Hong Kong Sar, carrying 4.2M metric tonnes, followed by Memphis International Airport in Tennessee (4M metric tonnes), Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska, Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China (3.6M metric tonnes), and Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky (3M metric tonnes). Space satellites are the fifth link. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the backbone of communication and location-based technology, the research report read.

According to Metro, the blaze happened on a bridge in Battersea, South London and resulted in services between Victoria and Brixton being suspended. Network Rail has warned commuters that trains may have to run slower due to high track temperatures. West Midlands Trains routes between Stratford-upon-Avon, Leamington Spa and Kidderminster - where speeds have been cut to 20mph down from the normal 60mph - have already been impacted. The speed limits are expected to remain in place until 8pm tonight. Network Rail is understood to be monitoring a number of locations and may enforce further speed restrictions to reduce the risk of lines buckling under because of the heatwave, Metro reported. The newspaper further said that the problems in Battersea started when wheel timbers on the bridge caught fire. Network Rail said the beams were very dry due to a lack of rain and although we do not know for sure, it is possible a stray spark set them alight. The fire comes at the Met Office on Monday issued an amber weather warning for extreme heat across England and Wales. The heat warning is in place for Sunday, when temperatures could reach the low 30s in some areas. It covers almost the entirety of England and much of Wales. The hottest temperatures will be felt in the south and Midlands, with London currently predicted to experience temperatures in the region of 34C.",https://www.joe.co.uk/news/stray-spark-ignites-fire-on-timber-beams-blocking-major-london-railway-line-347510,-1

The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Last month, White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said that YOU.S. intelligence had been tracking the possibility of North Korea supplying Russia with weapons for quite some time. And the reason why...there is such an intense effort on the part of Moscow to generate this kind of support from North Korea is that we have continued to squeeze...Russia's defense industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition, Sullivan said in September. Other researchers have also documented evidence pointing to increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia following Kim's visit to Russia. The level of rail traffic is far greater than what has been observed at the facility during the past five years, even compared to pre-Covid-19 levels, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report released earlier this month. Given that Kim and Putin discussed some military exchanges and cooperation at their recent summit, the dramatic increase in rail traffic likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.",https://www.rferl.org/a/north-korea-supplying-weaponry-russia-ukraine-war/32641294.html,-1

Whether it is through interactions with guests, or by offering his personal take on a story, Madeley is known to audiences for expressing himself in an unfiltered manner. Viewers are quick to share their thoughts on Madeley's most eyebrow-raising moments on social media. Here is a rundown of his most controversial moments so far. 'Appalling' discussions on Israel-Hamas war Madeley sparked intense backlash on social media on 17 October, when he asked a British-Palestinian Liberal Democrat MP if she had any indication of Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel before it unfolded. Hamas's shock attack on 7 October killed more than 1,300 Israelis, as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore vengeance on the militant group. Israel has retaliated with relentless airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas, killing more than 2,750 Palestinians as of Monday (16 October). The Lib-Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the escalating conflict in the Middle East. GMB viewers accused Madeley of appalling behaviour when he asked Moran: With your family connections in Gaza, did you have any indication of what was going to happen 10 days ago ... was there any word on the street? Moran appeared taken aback by Madeley's question before replying she was as surprised by the attack as anyone else. Audiences called for Madeley to apologise to Moran or be taken off-air, one day after he compared civilian deaths in Gaza to those in Nazi Germany. During a GMB episode on Monday, he asked his co-host Susanna Reid if it was fair to draw a parallel between the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, with those of German civilians during the Second World War. Not just the holocaust, but with what the allies, the British, the free French did when they invaded Europe in 1944 and defeated the Nazis by going into Germany and in doing so, by going into Germany, apart from the bombing campaigns that the RAF and the American airforce launched, lots of German civilians were killed, Madeley said. Comparing climate activists to paedophiles Madeley's most recent moment of controversy took place on 28 March during a conversation about the decision of a group of Britain's top lawyers to refuse to prosecute climate activists. If these people, these barristers and lawyers, have announced they will not prosecute - they simply will not even get started in a court of law - someone who has glued themselves to the road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest, are they still happy to defend, say, a paedophile? Madeley asked. Some viewers expressed their disdain for his comments online, with one writing: Note to Richard Madeley - if you do not have anything sensible to say please do not say anything. Madeley was passionate in his questioning of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) leader, and pressed Lynch on the timing of the strikes. Why could not you have put all these strikes in January? Madeley asked Lynch. Why do you have to target people at Christmas? You will be putting people out of business who run hotels, who run restaurants, who run bars, and retail. Well, we are not targeting Christmas, Lynch replied. It is not Christmas yet, Richard. I do not know when your Christmas starts, but mine starts on Christmas Eve. Viewers were less than impressed with Madeley's conduct in the conversation, with one online commenter tweeting: Richard Madeley needs to calm down and let other people speak. A lot of the public stand with the rail strikers and nurses etc. Shamima Begum and Hitler Youth comments During a discussion on whether former Isis bride Shamima Begum should be allowed to return to the country, Madeley went off on a tangent about the Second World War. Obviously, we had the Nuremberg trials after the war and we hanged quite a few Nazis and imprisoned a lot of others and we let them out eventually. But we did not go after the Hitler Youth as far as I am aware. We did not go after the Hitler Youth - we only went after adults who served in the Hitler regime. And that is something to reflect on, I think. Susanna Reid appeared to be baffled by her co-host's reflections, and it led to some viewers comparing him to Alan Partridge, Steve Coogan's bumbling broadcaster character. Debating with Dr Hilary about Covid lockdown restrictions In July 2021, Madeley clashed opinions with Dr Hilary Jones, a longtime contributor to the programme, over their differing views on lockdown restrictions. The GP claimed that the UK should take rising Covid-19 cases more seriously - as Australia was at the time - rather than abandoning restrictions altogether. However, Madeley opposed Dr Jones's caution, telling him: But we have the vaccine and Australia has not. When Hilary explained that vaccines did not provide 100 per cent protection, Madeley said that he was being misleading.",https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/richard-madeley-gmb-good-morning-britain-comments-b2309914.html,-1

In the process, lawyer Natig Beybalayev, applied to the court to refuse Vagif Khachatryan's defense due to his health, and his application was accepted. Vagif Khachatryan was provided with another lawyer, Radmila Abdulova. Vagif Khachatryan's statement to the investigation was announced in the court. In his testimony to the investigation, he said that he was born in Badara village of Askeran district in 1955. He has been registered and lived in that village, he is married and has three daughters. He has two brothers and one sister in the family. His sister and brother Garnik are dead. Vagif Khachatryan said that in 1973 he graduated from the three-month military school. In 1974-1976, he was in military service in the ranks of the former Soviet army, and then he started working as a driver in the agrarian-industrial department in the city of 'Stepanakert' (Khankendi). In September 1992, after Robert Kocharyan became the head of the Garabagh Committee, he was called to serve by mobilization from the 'Stepanakert' (Khankendi) city military commissariat under the name of Armenian self-defense until the age of 50-55. In this regard, Vagif Khachatryan went to the military commissariat together with about 100 residents of Badara village and registered, and after returning to the village, the conscripts were divided into three groups with 33 people in each group. Later, he was taken to Noragh village of Askeran district by the soldiers of the military commissariat. After conducting military training there, in mid-September 1992, the group with Vagif Khachatryan was taken to the heights of Farrukh mountain and assigned to serve at the post there. Khachatryan said that there were no battles with Azerbaijanis around Mount Farrukh during his service, and he did not participate in those battles. He said that he was brought to the Khankendi city hospital in early October 1992, where he was treated for about 20 days, because he had a cold in the kidneys and intestines while serving at the post. Then he was discharged from service due to his illness. As a civilian, he started working as a laborer in the rear security service, in the food warehouse located in the village of Noragh, Askeran district. It should be noted that Vagif Khachatryan is accused of killing 25 Azerbaijanis, injuring 14 people, and displacing 358 Azerbaijanis from their legal place of residence in Meshali village of Khojaly district in December 1991. In addition, Vagif Khachatryan did not commit these crimes alone; there were other accomplices with him. Those persons are residents of the Badara village of Khojaly district Emest Bakhshiyevich Sarkisyan, Armais Bakhshiyevich Sarkisyan, Benik Astanovic Gasparyan, Khoren Melikovich Abramyan, Armen Sarkisovich Avanesyan, Vova Armaisovich Sarkisyan Gari Nikolayevich Khachaturian, Nikolai Beglarovich Kachaturyan, Armen Karagenovich Abramyan, Armenovitch Abramyan, Zina Armenovich Abramyan, Vahid Armenovich Abramyan, Karen Ashotovich Ohanyan, Naorik Ashotovich Ohanyan, Gurgen Benikovich Gasparyan, Valery Benkovic Gasparyan, Albert Melikovich Davidyan, Samvel Rafikovich Sahakyan, Asatur Bakhshiyevich Osipyan, Karlen Bakhshiyevich Khachatryan, Eduard Beglarovich Israelyan, Artur Vartanovich Avakyan, Surik Armaisovich Sarkisyan, as well as Verdi Allahverdiyan, Vilen Verdiyan, Grisha Magishovich, Slavik Ardemovich, Gavrusha Zadurovich, Ruben, Andronik are persons whose identities are unknown to the investigation. With the aim of committing those criminal acts, Vagif Khachatryan, together with the abovementioned members of the illegal armed military units, actively participated in creating national hatred and enmity between the Azerbaijani and Armenian nations, humiliating the national dignity of Azerbaijanis, restricting their rights due to their nationality, and taking actions aimed at the supremacy of Armenians. Starting from the summer of 1988, he organized systematic attacks on Azerbaijanis going from Meshali village of Khojaly (former Asgaran) district to Agdam and Khoja Khankendi cities, beat them, insulted them, threatened to kill them, destroyed their property and other actions aimed at their physical destruction committed. Also, in the indictment, the names of the Azerbaijani policemen and military personnel who were killed by Armenians for helping to evacuate civilians from the siege in Meshali village of Khojaly district were announced. It was reported that on December 23, 1991, Rustamov Hidayat Eldar oglu, born on August 19, 1970, was sent to the Meshali police station from the Agdam district police (former militia) department to help the besieged civilians. Born on June 06, 1969, Agayev Faig Alish oghlu, soldier of the 701st (former 18110) military unit of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Lieutenant Eyyubov Kamil Baba, born on October 13, 1964, soldier Gonagov, born on July 9, 1961 Son of Musal Mirzaga and a fighter of the volunteer self-defense unit, born on June 28, 1961, Azimov Tahir Eyyub son Vagif Khachatryan and other members of the Armenian military units were killed. Vagif Khachatryan's torture of Azerbaijanis was also included in the indictment. It is stated in the indictment that Vagif Khachatryan together with 5 other members of the illegal armed military units unknown to the investigation came to the cell where Mammad Kazmov and Zakir Novruzov of Meshali village, who had come to the Khankendi (then Stepanakert) for driving examines and had been illegally arrested in November 1988, and insulted them in Armenian and said that it had to exterminate Azerbaijanis. He punched and kicked detainees and hit them on the face, head and other parts of the body, then he continued to beat them because he did not get an answer by asking who owns Garabagh, and plunging the tip of his knife between legs of detainees, he said, it is necessary to cut your organs that you Azerbaijanis would not bring forth a generation. He stabbed in the scrotum of Mammad Kazimov, and because of the impact of the blow, Mammad Kazimov used abusive words to Vagif Khachatryan in Armenian. Following the abusive words, Vagif Khachatryan cut several wounds on Kazimov's body and said: let his blood flow until he dies like a dog. However, Vagif Khachatryan announced that he was not guilty. --- Qabil Ashirov is AzerNews' staff journalist, follow him on Twitter: gAshirov",https://www.azernews.az/karabakh/216205.html,-1

That is according to the posters outside the town's Lyceum Theatre, where the red-velour interior and cherub-adorned balcony evoke the theatre's Edwardian heyday. But a far bigger name is no longer coming to Crewe. HS2. On October 4, the Prime Minister announced his decision to scrap the second phase of the high-speed railway line from Birmingham to Manchester. He offered funding for northern rail but made no mention of Crewe, the East Cheshire town synonymous with railways ever since the first train arrived in July 1837. Crewe had been earmarked as a major interchange between HS2 and the existing rail system yet, in a heartbeat, the rail gateway to the Northwest of England was erased from the high-speed tourist map. The project would have acted, according to Cheshire East Council, as a huge catalyst for regeneration, providing a potential 750m economic boost to the town. Crewe has lost out, it says, on 5,000 new jobs, 4,500 new homes and a major upgrade to the Grade II-listed railway station, dating from 1867. The Department for Transport subsequently pledged to improve the station for the existing network. So, what now? I have come to Crewe on a warm October afternoon to seek out the town's hidden heritage, its 33 listed buildings and proud tradition of working-class history often lost amid the boarded-up shops. I start by crossing Memorial Square with its statue of Britannia to visit the Grade II-listed Crewe Market Hall, a former cheese market and cattle auction now reborn as the in-vogue venue for street food, craft ales and evening live events. I find Ruth Jackson, barista at Mini Bean Coffee, still pondering the implications of the HS2 decision. There is a huge amount of disappointment across town, says Ruth, who swapped Frappuccinos at the Crewe branch of Starbucks for a plucky coffee independent. The irony that Crewe is famous for its railway heritage is not lost on us. Indeed. It was the Grand Junction Railway Company that first established Crewe at the height of the Victorian railway boom. The Crewe Works, opened to build and repair locomotives, completed its first train, Columbine, in 1843. The new town grew up around the works and Crewe went on to produce more than 8,000 locomotives for Britain's railways until 1991. By the 1870s, the town's population had swelled to 43,000 steam-loving locals, while King George V and Queen Mary came to inspect the new Royal Train in April 1931. The former Crewe Works is now the Crewe Heritage Centre, a family attraction celebrating 185 years of rail heritage with an exhibition hall and behind-the-scenes visits to trainspotter heaven: the 1938 North Junction Signal Box. I spent my childhood standing at my local level crossing outside Crewe, watching the steam engines, says Heritage Centre Trustee Brian Bailey, who started his railway career as a 15-year-old apprentice and served 34 years on the railways. Crewe would have built the new bogeys for HS2, the work invigorating the town. Now, he sighs, the thunder of trains on the West Coast Mainline just beyond the viewing platform, it is all gone. Despite the setback, however, there are green shoots around the town centre. A new History Centre is earmarked for 2025, incorporating the new Cheshire Archives Service. There are two new self-guided heritage trails around town and, at Betley Street, a row of rail workers' cottages from the mid 1800s have been lovingly saved, the neat rows with pea-green doors and hanging baskets arranged around a courtyard of autumn-coloured beech trees. New independent businesses are also moving back into the town centre with The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) recently championing the Crewe Beer Crawl, five independent craft-beer pubs within staggering distance. We need to get more people, such as beer nerds, to get off the train here, says Sean Ayling, head brewer at Tom's Tap and Brewhouse on Thomas Street. Going forward, I would like to see more independent places to eat, such as the Holy Bun on Ruskin Road, and shuttle bus connections between the different parts of the town. I finish my exploration with an autumnal stroll through Queens Park, the Victorian public space designed by the landscape architect Edward Kemp and gifted to the town by its wealthy railway owning benefactors. The boating lake and bowling green hark back to a more genteel period in Crewe's history, while the iron gates feature the town's original coat of arms with the phraseNever behind. The revised coat of arms of 1955 has the motto of Semper Contendo or Ever pressing forward. After this month's news, the town's catchphrase could not feel further from reality.

A 19-year-old Sikh on a New York City bus was attacked in a suspected hate crime assault by an assailant who tried to remove his turban while saying, We do not wear that in this country, police say. The New York City Police Department said the incident unfolded Sunday morning aboard MTA shuttle bus 8810 in the area of 118 Street and Liberty Avenue in the borough of Queens. The suspect, wearing a bright yellow jacket, approached the teen passenger and said, We do not wear that in this country and take that mask off! before punching him in the back of the head, face and back multiple times. The assault left the victim with minor laceration and pain, police said. The suspect also attempted to remove the victim's turban from his head. The victim was of the Sikh faith, NBC New York reported. The suspect fled on foot along Liberty Avenue, authorities said. No further injuries were reported and the victim refused further medical treatment, police said. The NYPD Hate Crimes Unit is investigating. Police shared photos of the suspect, described as a man between 25 to 35 years old, with a dark complexion, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with brown eyes and black hair, wearing blue jeans and sneakers.

The Sunday afternoon incident sent train cars and coal falling onto the highway, killing a 60-year-old truck driver and closing I-25 indefinitely in both directions -- potentially for longer than a week. It may take up to two years for investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board to complete their work and release a final because for Sunday's derailment and bridge collapse, though an initial report should be released within a month, the NTSB said. The interstate cannot be cleaned up or reopened until investigators finish their on-site inspection, state and federal officials said Monday. That process is expected to take at least several days. In an interview, Shailen Bhatt, the leader of the Federal Highway Administration and a former head of the Colorado Department of Transportation until 2017, reiterated a state timeline that the closure could extend for days to weeks. Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that state officials' immediate priority is safely getting the highway open both ways, but he cautioned the reopening would take time, given that the NTSB was in control of the site. (For the most up-to-date information on local and regional traffic detours, travelers should check CDOT's website and social media as well as cotrip.org.) The safety board said in a statement Monday afternoon that the derailment of the BNSF Railway-operated train caused the bridge to partially collapse, crushing the semi-truck and killing its driver. Thirty rail cars on the 124-car train derailed, spilling coal and debris across the interstate about four miles north of Pueblo. CDOT said six or seven train cars landed on the highway itself. Once the NTSB's initial field work is complete, it may take crews another two days to fully clear the debris, Polis said. A long line of trucks were arrayed near the scene Monday afternoon, waiting to begin clearing the scene. One driver said he would been waiting since midnight. Just being down here, you see all of the coal from the overturned train cars -- it is a significant recovery effort, Bhatt said of the work to come. Polis' statement expressed condolences for the truck driver and his family. The Pueblo County Coroner's Office on Monday identified the driver as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California. The governor said he had spoken with YOU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and that the state was prepared to move as quickly as possible to reopen I-25 once given the green light. Our administration has been working for months to position Colorado to take advantage of the safety and rail investments that Congress and President Biden made possible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Polis said. Sadly, those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, but it is clear that federal funds for rail support are critical for Colorado. Questions remained Monday about who owned the rail bridge and who had inspection and oversight authority for it. The bridge did not have an official name, according to Sarah Sulick, a spokeswoman for the safety board. Initially, state officials said it was owned and operated by BNSF, which owns the train that derailed. Railroads typically own, inspect and maintain the tracks and bridges over which their trains run, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, with rail bridges numbering in the tens of thousands across the United States. The railroad administration also said BNSF owned the line. But the company told The Denver Post that the state owns the bridge, as did Bhatt, the federal highway administrator. CDOT spokesman Matt Inzeo said the agency still was trying to confirm who had responsibility for the bridge, noting that staff were digging through records going back to its construction in 1958. He confirmed that the state inspected the bridge in 2022, though he said the structure was not covered by federal rules requiring regular inspections. The bridge was a 188-foot-long, 14-foot-wide steel girder bridge, according to CDOT. Jaime Horowitz, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents at least one crew member on the derailed train, said he could not comment Monday because the union is part of the federal investigation team. There have been 11 train derailments in Colorado this year, all involving BNSF, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. The Texas-based railway and competitor Union Pacific together operate the vast majority of Colorado's more than 2,800 miles of railroad. BNSF has had 177 derailments nationwide so far in 2023, federal data shows. Company spokeswoman Kendall Kirkham Sloan wrote in an email that the state owned the collapsed bridge but declined to comment further, beyond providing a statement confirming the derailment and the subsequent investigation. Bhatt said the White House had been informed of the derailment and interstate closure. Asked about potential causes, he deferred to the federal investigators, who are interviewing witnesses and reviewing video recordings. I would just say that this is being tracked at the highest levels, he said, and we are very aware of the national impacts of a closure of an interstate, but also the local impacts to Pueblo and other communities down here. The derailment comes as legislators here are taking a closer look at railroad safety and oversight in the wake of a February train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, that sparked a large fire and raised concerns about hazardous chemicals aboard. Two weeks ago, state lawmakers on the Transportation Legislation Review Committee approved a bill that would cap the length of trains in Colorado at 8,500 feet, require operators to maintain safety detectors and allow crew members to report safety concerns. Commercial rail incidents have become more frequent and with increased severity over the last decade, said Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat. And I think we are overdue for taking action to mitigate that, to put some safeguard into the commercial rail transportation network.

Follow live updates,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -- Israel bombed areas of southern Gaza where it had told Palestinians to flee to ahead of an expected ground invasion, killing dozens of people on Tuesday in attacks it says are targeted at Hamas militants that rule the besieged territory. With no water, fuel or food being delivered to Gaza since Hamas' brutal attack on Israel last week, mediators struggled to break a deadlock over delivering supplies to increasingly desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals. YOU.S. President Joe Biden prepared to head to the region as he and other world leaders tried to prevent the war from sparking a broader regional conflict. Violence flared Tuesday along Israel's border with Lebanon, where Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants operate. In Gaza, dozens of injured were rushed to hospitals after heavy attacks outside the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, residents reported.

Yep, and it is coming to Tucson An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Family members came to claim the bodies, wrapped in white bedsheets, some soaked in blood. An airstrike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble, killing nine members of the family living there. Three members of another family that had evacuated from Gaza City were killed in a neighboring home. The dead included one man and 11 women and children. Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike. The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts, infrastructure and command centers. When we see a target, when we see something moving that is Hamas, we will take care of it, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said. A strike in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed a top Hamas commander, Ayman Nofal, the group's military wing said -- the most high-profile militant known to have been killed so far in the war. Nofal was in charge of Hamas militant activities in the central Gaza Strip and was associated with the creation of the group's joint operations room that coordinated between Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other militants in the territory. The YOU.N. human rights office decried appalling reports that civilians who were trying to flee to southern Gaza were killed by a military strike. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani urged Israeli forces to avoid aerial bombardments, indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks and to take precautions to avoid - and in any case, to minimize - loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. Israel sealed off Gaza since the militant attack on southern Israel October 7 killed over 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in some 200 taken captive in Gaza. Hamas militants in Gaza have launched rockets every day since, aiming at cities across Israel. Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Nearly two-thirds of those killed were children, a ministry official said. Another 1,200 people across Gaza are believed to be buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said. Emergency teams struggled to rescue people while cut off from the internet and mobile networks, running out of fuel and exposed to unceasing airstrikes. On Monday Israeli warplanes struck the headquarters of the Civil Defense in Gaza City, killing seven paramedics. Another 16 medics and doctors have been killed on the job, Gaza officials said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that his country's retaliation against Hamas aims to eradicate the group's political and military rule over Gaza. ''We are not fighting just our war. We are fighting the war of all civilized countries and all civilized peoples, he said. Israel has massed troops at the border for an expected ground offensive, but Hecht said Tuesday no concrete decisions have been made despite Israel's mass evacuation order for the north of the Gaza Strip. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes -- roughly half of Gaza's population -- and 60 are now in the approximately 14-kilometer (8-mile) long area south of the evacuation zone, the YOU.N. said. Aid workers warned that the territory was near complete collapse. Hospitals were on the verge of losing electricity, threatening the lives of thousands of patients, and hundreds of thousands of people searched for bread and water. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio The YOU.N. agency for Palestinians said more than 400,000 displaced people are crowded into schools and other facilities in the south. The agency said it has only 1 liter of water a day for each of its staff members trapped in the territory. Israel opened a water line into the south for three hours that benefitted only 14 percent of Gaza's population, the YOU.N. said. At the Rafah crossing, Gaza's only connection to Egypt, truckloads of aid were waiting to enter. The World Food Program said that it had more than 300 tons of food waiting to cross into Gaza. Civilians with foreign citizenship -- many of them Palestinians with dual nationalities -- also waited in Rafah, desperate to get out. We come to the border crossing hoping that it will open, but so far there is no information, said Jameel Abdullah, a Swedish citizen. An agreement to open the border appeared to have been reached Monday, but Israel denied reports of a cease-fire in Rafah, which would be a precondition. On Tuesday morning, gates were still closed. An Egyptian official said Tuesday that Egypt and Israel agreed that the aid convoys at the border would travel into Israel for inspection at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel. The aid would then be allowed into Gaza. A brief humanitarian cease-fire would take place and foreign nationals would be allowed to exit Gaza via Rafah, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak with the media. Officials for Hamas and Israel cast doubt on an immediate opening, saying they were unaware of an agreement. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited Israel for the second time in a week on Monday after a six-country tour through Arab nations, said in Tel Aviv that the YOU.S. and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. There were few details, but the plan would include the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way. Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of YOU.S. Central Command, arrived in Tel Aviv for meetings with Israeli military authorities ahead of a Biden visit planned for Wednesday to signal White House support for Israel. Biden will also travel to Jordan to meet with Arab leaders amid fears the fighting could spread in the region. Israel evacuated towns near its northern border with Lebanon, where the military has exchanged fire repeatedly with Hezbollah militants. Israel said it killed four militants wearing explosive vests who were attempting to cross into the country from Lebanon on Tuesday morning. Video from a reconnaissance drone the army shared showed the militants near the border wall before they were targeted, causing an explosion. No group immediately claimed responsibility. Whoever approaches the border with Lebanon will be killed, said Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. Israel has warned Lebanon it will strongly retaliate against attacks from across the border. Israel fought a vicious monthlong war with Hezbollah in 2006 that ended in a stalemate and a tense detente between the two sides. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Israel's continuing offensive in Gaza could cause a violent reaction across the region. Bombardments should be immediately stopped. Muslim nations are angry, Khamenei said, according to state media. Hamas' military wing released a hostage video on Monday showing a dazed woman having her arm wrapped with bandages. The woman, who identified herself as Mia Schem, 21, rocked slightly as she spoke, the sound of explosions reverberating in the background. The plight of the hostages -- Hamas claims it has more than 200 of them -- has dominated the Israeli media since the attack. Interviews with relatives of hostages are shown over and over on television. Israeli officials have vowed to maintain the siege of Gaza until the hostages are released.

The YOU.S. Senate recently hosted a hearing on the importance of aging at home. Our nation's Medicare program plans to implement potentially devastating cuts to its home healthcare program for older Americans, totaling a nearly 3.9 million loss next year in Nebraska alone. The Medicare program is failing to fulfill its promises to Nebraskans and the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who need home health services, testified Carrie Edwards, director of Mary Lanning Home Care in Hastings and president of the Nebraska Association for Home Healthcare and Hospice. She explained how these cuts impact their home health program, which has had to reduce its service area by 58 and cut down to just 36 of its patients. Without access to home-based healthcare, aging Nebraskans cannot easily return home following hospitalization to heal and recover. Instead, they must endure longer hospital stays or face placement in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility. People are also reading...

Most seniors and Americans with disabilities want to recover and rehabilitate in the comfort of their own homes, avoid rehospitalization, and maintain lower costs for their healthcare services. The home healthcare community in Nebraska, and throughout the country, is still reeling from a nearly 4 payment cut that began this year. Because of these cuts, one-third of Nebraska's home health agencies are operating with negative margins. Now Medicare has announced plans to implement another round of cuts to its Medicare home healthcare benefit program -- totaling more than 9 beginning in 2024. These cuts would seriously restrict home health providers' ability to deliver accessible care to those who need it, and would mean more than one-half of Nebraska's home health agencies would be operating in the red. We have seen agencies close in many rural areas in the past five years, and I fear that additional closures will happen without congressional intervention. The cumulative national impact of these newest impending cuts could result in a reduction of as much as 25 billion for Medicare home healthcare services over the next decade. It is highly unlikely that Medicare's home health program could survive such a tremendous loss. As it stands, home healthcare providers are already struggling with a shrinking healthcare workforce. Additionally, years of continued Medicare cuts to home healthcare providers have made it harder for hospitals and health systems to utilize and offer home health services for patients upon discharge. Bipartisan lawmakers -- including Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb. -- have introduced legislation called the Preserving Access to Home Health Act (S. 2137H.R. 5159) to prevent these devastating cuts from going into effect. The legislation would mitigate the impact of the cuts to home healthcare that began this year and prevent any additional cuts from taking place until at least 2028. Here in Nebraska, more than 17,000 seniors and patients with disabilities are enrolled in Medicare's home health program. Nebraska's home healthcare community helps ensure patients have access to the full range of services and support they need -- from skilled nursing care and rehabilitation to physical therapy and social supports -- but we simply cannot do it without the proper support and adequate funding from Medicare. Congress must act now to help stop these cuts and enable home health providers and agencies in Nebraska, and across the nation, to continue providing the vital services Americans need to age safely at home.

2023-10-17 09:01:13.617,7786583900,weather,9d7cd3e4-fd5c-41a9-b75e-7bbf2f193d41,"In rare move, Ford executive chair calls on UAW to make a deal and end 'acrimonious' talks","DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Executive Chair Bill Ford on Monday warned that an ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers threatens the future livelihood of the company as well as the American automotive industry. Ford, who has been a part of UAW negotiations since 1982, pleaded with union members and leaders to work with the company, instead of against it, to reach a tentative deal to end to this acrimonious round of talks. Such comments by the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford are uncharacteristic during contract talks with the UAW. We are at a crossroads, Ford said during a news conference at the company's massive Rouge Complex in metro Detroit. Choosing the right path is not just about Ford's future and our ability to compete. This is about the future of the American automobile industry. Ford, ahead of speaking on stage, told reporters he wanted to elevate the conversation about the contract negotiations. Ford said he did not want to get personal in his remarks because it does not matter at this point. The UAW's leaders have called us the enemy in these negotiations. But I will never consider our employees as enemies. This should not be Ford versus the UAW, Ford said. It should be Ford and the UAW vs. Toyota and Honda, Tesla, and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home. UAW President Shawn Fain countered Ford's plea by ratcheting up the pressure. Bill Ford knows exactly how to settle this strike. Instead of threatening to close the Rouge, he should call up Ford CEO Jim Farley, tell him to stop playing games and get a deal done, or we will close the Rouge for him, he said in a statement. It is not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It is autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed. If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits. Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy -- they are the UAW members of the future. Ford did not threaten to close the Rouge Complex in his remarks. He did mention if American carmakers such as Ford lose to the competition, then jobs, future investments and factories like the one we are in today will be lost. Ford's remarks come after a week of contentious talks between the company and the UAW, including the union unexpectedly announcing a strike Wednesday night at the company's highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant. More than 19,000 of Ford's 57,000 UAW members are currently impacted by the strike, including more than 16,600 striking workers. Another roughly 2,480 employees have been laid off as a result of the work stoppage. Ford last week said it was at the limit of what it can offer the UAW in terms of economic concessions. The company's most recent proposal included 23 to 26 wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health-care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments; and other benefits. Overall, only about 34,000 YOU.S. autoworkers with the companies -- or roughly 23 of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers -- are currently on strike. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. Fain last week said the union has entered a new phase of the targeted strikes in which it would no longer pre-announce the work stoppages, as it had been. Fain has said it is ultimately up to the members to decide when the strike ends, not UAW leadership. Opinions of the strike and current contract proposals varied on picket lines Monday outside Ford's nearby Michigan Assembly Plant, which was the first of three facilities to go on strike last month. I trust Shawn Fain, said Latosha Smith, a four-year worker at the plant. All the steps he is taken, it is for the because. Tamika Genus, a worker at the plant for roughly five years, said of course she would like it to come to a resolution, but it is worth it. She later added, We are doing what we have got to do. Jeff Nichol, a body shop worker at the plant who was laid off due to the strike, said he wishes that the sides would come to a conclusion a lot sooner than later. He also would like union leaders to be more transparent regarding exact details of the company's proposals. Nichol, who is been autoworker for over 11 years, said he knows it is an unpopular opinion, but he would support Ford's current proposal, including a 23 wage increase. What I have been getting is good enough, so any little bit of extra does help, especially with the current economy, he said. The way I look at it, too, is the amount of time that we are off, that also plays into how long it is going to take for us to make a difference for the amount of money that we lose every single week. Ford said Friday employees who have been on strike since Sept. 15 have on average lost about 4,000 in pretax income through four weeks of the strike.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ford-executive-chair-calls-uaw-make-deal-end-acrimonious-talks-rcna120781,-1

Forecasters say Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Stirling and surrounding areas could see unusually heavy rainfall from 06:00 on Thursday to 18:00 on Friday. Up to 100mm (4in) was likely, with some upland areas seeing as much as 200mm (8in). Network Rail Scotland said it was holding meetings to assess the potential impact. The Met Office has updated a number of yellow be aware warnings for most of the rest of Scotland for Thursday through to Saturday morning. An earlier yellow warning has been upgraded to amber and warns of the potential for travel disruption and flooding of properties. The Met Office said: It is increasingly likely that a period of disruptive, heavy and prolonged rainfall will affect parts of eastern Scotland. The heaviest rainfall is more likely to occur over Angus and southeast Grampian, although even lower lying areas could see unusually heavy rainfall during this period. Very strong southeasterly winds are likely to accompany heavy rainfall which may exacerbate impacts. On Monday, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) warned that people living in parts of Scotland hit by flooding a week ago should prepare for further incidents due to Storm Babet. Sepa said some of the areas were still saturated by heavy rain that hit earlier this month.",https://news.yahoo.com/storm-babet-amber-rain-warning-115454589.html,-1

The UK's rail infrastructure company Network Rail has cut around 500 roles from its Track Renewal Services (TRS) arm, despite recent advice from the Office of Rail and Road that it should instead invest 600m in the crucial team. Network Rail said it will reduce staff numbers for the 'Control Period 7 (CP7), April 2024-March 2029' due to expected lower demand for the renewals unit over the next five years. There are currently 794 roles within TRS, to be cut to just 263. However, 202 of those jobs have not been filled, so 269 redundancies will be made. A Network Rail spokesperson said: We know there is going to be lower demand for the specialist track renewal services we offer in the next five years (CP7), as we invest in our infrastructure in other ways, so we have begun consulting with our colleagues and trades unions on changes to restructure and re-size some of our teams accordingly. The UK rail workers union, the RMT, said it was another case of slash and burn in the sector. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: These cuts represent further significant Network Rail cutbacks at a time when the industry needs to be developing its skill base not outsourcing the work to privateers. We have seen the impact of de-skilling and outsourcing on our railway network, a decline in safety and an increase in profiteering which combine to create a deadly concoction for workers and passengers alike, he added. In its advice to Network Rail, published in June 2023, the proposed: Network Rail increases spend on core assets for the GB rail network by 600 million. This would be funded by rephasing or reprioritising expenditure from areas ORR considers of lower importance.

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain and gale-force winds that could bring widespread flooding and pose a 'danger to life'. Forecasters said the most severe conditions will hit eastern Scotland where a 36-hour amber warning has been activated from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday. Yellow weather warnings are in force for much of the rest of the UK from tomorrow until Saturday morning, but the alert level could even reach red in parts of Scotland. As the storm approaches tonight, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. Travel disruption is also expected across the UK - with National Rail already saying CrossCountry and Great Western Railway services between Exeter, Paignton and Plymouth are likely to be disrupted from 5.30pm today due to the severe weather. CrossCountry said no trains would run between Exeter and Plymouth from 6.30pm today until 11.30am tomorrow because of the conditions due to hit Dawlish, an exposed part of the line where the railway runs alongside the south Devon coastline. Network Rail said its teams were concerned by the high risk of flooding and strong winds potentially uprooting trees, with weather specialists in its control room considering whether any speed restrictions will be required in Scotland this week. The Met Office's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain. This graphic shows total rainfall over the course of the warnings from tomorrow until Saturday A Nasa satellite image released today shows Storm Babet approaching Europe last night Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. The warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. Some of these alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During Storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days.

There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves. The heaviest rain is expected in eastern areas of Scotland, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7 to 8 in Scotland, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. Communities in Aviemore, Highlands, Argyll and Bute, and Perthshire were badly impacted October, with weather so bad it was compared to the Beast from the East in 2018. Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83, and large parts of the Scottish rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. A 36-hour amber warning has been activated from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday WEDNESDAY: Four days of rain warnings start with one that comes into force tomorrow THURSDAY: This is when the impact based on the number of warnings in place will be greatest FRIDAY: This is the same as Thursday, apart from the Northern Ireland warning which ends SATURDAY: Rain warnings will continue to cover much of England and Scotland on Saturday Before the amber alert was issued today, Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. How Babet was named after a Dutch woman born during a gale Storm Babet was named after a woman from the Netherlands who said she had been born during a gale. The Met Office compiles its annual list of storm names in conjunction with the Dutch and Irish weather services. The Dutch weather service organised an open day last year, inviting visitors to submit suggestions for names - and Babet was among those involved, reported the Daily Telegraph. Further down the list is Storm Elin, which was named after a visitor who said they had a 'tempestuous granddaughter' with the same name. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. 'Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required, and we continue to work with the Met Office to monitor the situation 247. 'Impacts from surface water and rivers are likely, and with catchments saturated from recent heavy rain and flooding, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. 'There is also concern that surface water flooding may be exacerbated by debris blocking drainage, culverts, etc as a result of the high winds. 'If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel. Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: 'A disruptive period of weather is on the way. 'There is some high totals (of rain) which have the potential to disrupt travel plans... possibility of power cuts as well as the obvious risk of flooding. 'As you look at Wednesday, the first pulse of rain is looking to particularly influence Northern Ireland, Wales and the southwest of England, and into Thursday.

He added that further weather warnings are likely to be announced by the Met Office in the coming days. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers. Sam Hughes, the charity's water safety partner, said: 'The forecasted strong winds along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' Met Office chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. 'It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'For Scotland, this rain will be fairly heavy and persistent through much of the second half of the week and into the early part of the weekend.

Gatwick and Stansted airports reported readings of 0C (32F), while temperatures in the Scottish Highlands fell to -2.2C (28F). As many as 35 weather stations reported temperatures below freezing last night, the Met Office said. The last such widespread frost was 172 days ago on April 27. The RAC was fearing an estimated 20 per cent spike in callouts yesterday on what it dubbed 'Flat Battery Monday' as car motors were more likely to fail due to the freezing night. In the Republic of Ireland, Met ireann has issued orange weather warnings for Cork and Waterford as spells of heavy rain and blustery winds were expected to arrive this morning. The Met ireann warning will be in effect from 6am today until 6am tomorrow. The forecaster told residents to expect considerable rainfall combined with 'blustery east to southeast winds at times'. Storm Babet could cause poor visibility, localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide, the forecaster said. Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kilkenny and Wexford were given a yellow rain warning that comes into effect at 6am today. A yellow rain warning for Connacht will be in place from noon today until noon tomorrow, while one for Antrim, Armagh and Down will begin at 6am tomorrow and run until midday on Thursday.",https://internewscast.com/news/met-office-warns-storm-babet-poses-a-danger-to-life-as-it-issues-amber-alert-amid-fears-flash-floods-and-gale-force-winds-will-batter-britain-from-today/,-1

The military said its forces had carried out well-aimed strikes on enemy airfields near the eastern city of Luhansk and the southern city of Berdiansk but gave few details. It did not comment on media reports that Kyiv had used YOU.S.-provided ATACMS long-range missiles for the first time in the attacks. Ukrainian Special Forces said nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher and other equipment had been destroyed, runways had been hit, and heavy losses had been inflicted on Russian forces. Russia's Defence Ministry did not mention the attacks. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region which is partly controlled by Moscow, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defences had ensured the attack on the Berdiansk airfield was not successful. But a number of Russian military bloggers reported the attacks, and the Russian Telegram channel Fighterbomber said Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv and the Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS at Russian forces for the first time on Tuesday. Kyiv has been seeking the missiles to enhance its ability to attack supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory but has not confirmed receiving them. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made no direct mention of the overnight attacks but said after meeting military chiefs: Thanks also to those who powerfully destroy the logistics and bases of the occupiers on our land. There are results. I thank some of our partners: effective weapons, as we agreed, he said. UKRAINIAN COUNTEROFFENSIVE Since starting a counteroffensive in early June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in areas Russian forces occupy in Ukraine. The counteroffensive has made only gradual gains through vast Russian minefields and heavily entrenched Russian positions, and Kyiv says Moscow is attacking in some areas ahead of the second winter since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter, and that fighting continued around the town of Avdiivka on the eastern front. Kyiv says its forces are holding their ground, including around Avdiivka and Kupiansk. The Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, said in its latest report on the conflict that Moscow had made only limited gains in the area around Avdiivka and that the pace of its advance there had slowed.

Organised and mobilised, the working class has the power to stop the warmongers. The following article was written by our comrades in Britain, offering a model motion to be passed in Trade Unions and giving an explanation of what workers can do to combat the imperialist war machine. Workers all over the world are looking on in horror as the Israeli state begins a campaign of collective punishment for the Palestinians trapped in Gaza. Having been caught off-guard by the coordinated nature of Hamas' attacks, the Zionist Israeli ruling class are now exacting a brutal revenge. Seeing this bombardment and killing of civilians, many in Britain will be asking themselves the question: what can we do to help? First of all, we must recognise that our strength lies in our collective organisation and mobilisation, especially in trade unions. If you are in a trade union, you should therefore try to get your branch to pass our model motion: declaring unequivocal solidarity with the Palestinian people; condemning the attacks by the Israeli state; and denouncing the complicity of British imperialism. Workers' action The power of the working class does not come from our decisions as consumers, but from our role as producers  Image: Socialist Appeal This motion points to the real because of the conflict: not who shot first, but who the oppressor is, and who aids them in their oppression. But more than just condemning the imperialists, the motion calls for action. We need to understand our true power: our ability to mobilise and demonstrate; and, most crucially of all, to withdraw our labour. This does not mean taking action on an individual basis - not turning up to work on Monday morning; refusing to buy this or that product - but collectively. The power of the working class does not come from our decisions as consumers, but from our role as producers. We are not customers, but workers. Whether through trade unions or otherwise, collective action by the organised working class - particularly in the industries that the capitalists rely on to keep their war machine going - can have a direct impact. Such militant mass action can hit at the imperialists directly by stopping production. The Israel Defence Forces cannot drop bombs they do not have! In this way, workers can realise the full potential of the strength that they hold in society. Even one workplace taking action can have an enormous impact on events, and inspire other workers to follow suit. Lessons from history To take one heroic example: In 1974, following Pinochet's coup in Chile, workers at the Rolls Royce factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, took action in exactly this way. After learning that the jet engines they were repairing belonged to the Chilean junta, they refused to touch these vital aircraft components. This workers' boycott went on for so long that the engines themselves rusted - rendering them impotent, and preventing their use in the murder Chilean workers thousands of miles away. Similarly, dock workers organised by the CGiL union in Genoa, Italy, went on strike in 2019 to prevent a Saudi-owned ship from loading its cargo of weapons, destined for use in the reactionary regime's war on Yemen. Just last year, Greek rail workers also attempted to prevent tanks from being transported to Ukraine for use in the conflict there. There is also a precedent in relation to workers' action to stop arms heading to Israel: most notably of all, that of the South African port workers' union SATAWU, who refused to unload an Israeli ship during the height of the state's bombardment of Gaza in 2021. In light of the latest aggression from the Israeli state, these inspiring examples provide vital lessons about how workers can and should fight the oppression of Palestinians today - by using their role in production and distribution to halt the imperialist warmongers in their tracks. Enemy at home Overthrowing our imperialist governments is ultimately what will prevent Israeli aggression and stop war for good  Image: Socialist Appeal Such a movement must also take aim at 'our own' ruling class. Netanyahu's regime is able to act with impunity because US and British imperialism see a strong Israel as vital to their interests in the Middle East. To fight such a force, we therefore need to think bigger. A campaign of workers' action against the production and transport of arms is just the start. Overthrowing our imperialist governments, the enemy at home, as well as the capitalist system they represent and defend, is ultimately what will prevent Israeli aggression and stop war for good. We cannot rely on bourgeois diplomacy and international organisations like the 'United' Nations - and other such tools of imperialism - to bring about genuine peace. The only true friends that the Palestinian masses have are the workers of the world. By smashing their own imperialist states, workers in the West can provide genuine class solidarity to the Palestinian because. That is how we can help win freedom, at long last, for the oppressed millions in the Middle East and beyond. Workers' control Beyond just halting the production and distribution of weapons, workers in the arms sector should also fight for ownership and control over the industry. In this way, taking inspiration from the Lucas Plan of the 1970s, factories and machinery could be repurposed away from arms and towards socially-useful products, such as green technologies and healthcare equipment. On this basis, as part of a socialist plan of production, society's resources and workers' skills could be utilised to benefit people and the planet, rather than the profits of the private arms manufacturers. The role of communists in the trade unions is to draw all these threads together; to raise consciousness, and provide workers with confidence and a sense of their own power; and to be the most determined class fighters and internationalists. If you want to get organised as a communist in the labour movement, join us today.",https://www.marxist.com/how-workers-can-halt-the-imperialist-war-machine.htm,-1

Download Sample PDF Brochure at https:www.theinsightpartners.comsampleTIPRE00030051 Increasing focus on energy-efficient, sustainable, and environmentally viable alternatives to carbon-emitting technology in the transportation sector has been a driving factor for the Germany hydrogen fuel cell train market share. A German state-owned railway company, LVNG, has diversified its ways to phase out diesel in 2012. In 2018, it commenced operation of the Alstom Coradia iLint hydrogen fuel-cell trains on trial routes in the Lower Saxony. The rolling out of these hydrogen-driven trains commercially slowed down owing to challenges such as lack of appropriate hardware and software, driver shortage, and challenges of hydrogen refueling stations in the winter season. In addition, the country is finding electric vehicles cheaper than hydrogen fuel cells. However, Germany has set a carbon emissions reduction goal of 65 by 2030 and 88 by 2040. The rising advent of renewable energy resources and growing focus on utilizing green energy for initiating carbon emission goals are anticipated to boost the hydrogen fuel cell train market growth in Germany in the coming years. The increasing awareness of the benefits and efficiency level of hydrogen-driven fuel cells is one of the major driving factors for the market. Fuel cells make the trains or vehicles more efficient, with less vibrations in the bogies and less noise production than conventional trains. The hydrogen-driven fuel cell trains only emit water as a waste product and help reduce air pollution. The increasing efficiency and advancement of hydrogen fuel cell technology in speed, noise, vibration, and energy efficiency are enhancing the global hydrogen fuel cell train market growth. The growing population and urbanization are two major reasons fueling the demand for expanding railway transportation connectivity worldwide. The expanding industrialization and mounting number of working forces in different sectors also boost the requirement for new railway tracks for better connectivity. The overall growth and development in transportation connectivity are also having a positive impact in a broader sense on the growing advent of hydrogen fuel cell trains for fast travel. Europe is leading the hydrogen fuel cell train market, followed by Asia Pacific and North America. Germany is a leading market in Europe, and the US holds a major shareholder in North America. In addition, China and South Korea are two major contributors to the hydrogen fuel cell train market share in Asia Pacific. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Train Market: Competitive Landscape and Key Developments Alstom SA, TWI Ltd, Hyundai Corporation, Talgo, Siemens Mobility GmbH, CRRC Corp Ltd, WABTEC, Stadler Rail AG, and Ballard Power Systems are among the key hydrogen fuel cell train market players profiled during this study. In addition, several other important hydrogen fuel cell train market players have been studied and analyzed during the study to get a holistic view of the hydrogen fuel cell train market and its ecosystem. In 2023, First hydrogen-powered trains by CRRC and Woojin. Traction systems of both trains are equipped with fuel cells and supercapacitors; the travel range on a single charge reaches 600 km. With a top speed of 160 kmh, CRRC's train outruns the one by South Korea's Woojin Industrial Systems accelerating to 110 kmh. In 2023, Hyundai Rotem's hydrogen electric tram is coming into the spotlight as an eco-friendly transport with safety, feasibility and convenience for a hydrogen society ahead. In 2023, Hyundai Rotem Commercializes Hydrogen High-Speed Train. Through its RD and business portfolio, which is centered on three business divisions, namely Rail Solution, Defense Solution, and Ecoplant, Hyundai Rotem will pursue the global market. By adapting to the quickly shifting global environment and securing products that include cutting-edge technology based on the 4th industrial revolution, it is concentrating on developing future growth engines.

In 2022, the passenger rail segment accounted for the largest share of the global hydrogen fuel cell train market and is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. The demand for passenger trains is growing rapidly across different regions. This is mainly due to the rise in passenger traffic across different countries worldwide. Several governments across different countries have been taking initiatives to upgrade their existing rail infrastructure to reduce the operational expenses and the CO2 emissions from rail operations. For instance, in 2021, the Indian Railways Organization of Alternate Fuel (IROAF) launched an initiative to add hydrogen fuel cell trains to the country's rail infrastructure. The Indian Ministry of Railways has decided to convert several DEMU trains into hydrogen-powered trains through retrofitting operations. In September 2022, the Indian rail system integrator Medha Servo Drives provided the contract to Ballard Power Systems to provide fuel cell technologies for India's first-ever hydrogen power trains. Similarly, in December 2022, Alstom announced the launch of its first fully hydrogen-powered passenger train route in Germany, wherein the rail comprises 14 units of two-car Coradia iLint vehicles equipped with hydrogen fuel cell propulsion. Such developments have driven the demand for hydrogen fuel cell trains across different regions for the passenger rail segment.

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges.

However, ART's predecessor TAR and the transport ministry did not grant Arenaways approval to call at intermediate stations, believing this would have threatened the viability of Trenitalia's subsidised regional services. Arenaways failed to attract sufficient passengers and operations ceased in 2011.

Rates of unemployment, homelessness and emotional distress are elevated among veterans and military members transitioning to civilian life. With Arizona home to half a million veterans -- 70,000 of whom call our district home -- the unique issues they face are continually top of mind. From access to health care to skilled job training, I am committed to doing all I can to provide for those who served our country. Unfortunately, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is preparing to implement a policy change that will hamper access to critical health care and emergency medical services for veterans in Arizona and nationwide.

Yep, and it is coming to Tucson Beginning in February, the VA is scheduled to slash reimbursement rates paid when a veteran faces a medical emergency and is transported via air or ground ambulance. That could mean veterans having to shoulder more of the bill. Industry experts predict the VA cuts will force ambulance operators to close bases and discontinue service in communities where service costs are high. In other words: rural Arizona will be impacted. But veterans will not be the only ones hurt in this scenario: we will all pay the price if the ambulance and EMTs we need during a medical emergency are farther away. Access to health care is already limited in portions of my district where it is common for patients to drive for an hour or longer just to see a doctor. Cochise Regional Hospital and Santa Cruz Valley Regional Hospital have both closed in recent years. Further VA cuts to emergency medical services will only exacerbate the issue of limiting access to health care. Here in Arizona's 6th Congressional District, we are incredibly proud of our service members and veterans alike. Arizonans have had a long legacy of stepping up to serve our country and defend democracy both at home and abroad. In fact, during World War II, the City of Pima -- a small town in my district -- lost 27 men, accounting for the greatest loss suffered by any community in the country on a per capita basis. In addition, our district is home to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and Fort Huachuca - two key military installations. We have a duty to provide for those who protected us. The VA must not abandon veterans in their own time of need as they face illness, an accident or other medical emergency. That is why, as a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am proud to co-sponsor H.R. 5530: the VA Emergency Transportation Access Act. This bipartisan legislation will protect veterans' emergency medical services by blocking the VA from cutting reimbursement rates before the agency has fully reviewed all impacts to veterans' health care and sought input from veteran advocacy organizations and industry experts. This is commonsense legislation, which is why it is endorsed by some of our country's leading organizations representing veterans and first responders, including the American Legion, VFW, Paralyzed Veterans of America and more. Additionally, I was proud to join my colleague, Rep. Ryan Zinke (MT-1), in sending two letters to the Department of Veterans Affairs about these proposed cuts to reimbursements for emergency services, but we have yet to receive a response from the VA. The VA must freeze its planned cuts to emergency medical services and examine the widespread impacts this may have. Most importantly, I urge my colleagues in Congress to join me in preventing the agency from enacting similar reductions in the future without a full understanding of the impact to veterans. Our veterans should never doubt our nation's' commitment to them. We have a responsibility to take care of our veterans and when we enact changes like this to make their lives easier, healthier and better, we fulfill that commitment.

Neighbours fear infrastructure, such as roads and public transport, will struggle to cope with the influx of new people when the high rise development looms over the surrounding area. Developers Wembley Tower Ltd are looking to build a 250m development at Wembley Point, including 515 new homes, a boxing gym, retail space, and a new cycle way. It is part of a wider redevelopment of the area, which has already seen the existing 21-storey 'WEM Tower' turned into 439 studio flats. The plan has received a number of objections from residents who feel the scheme will adversely affect their quality of life. People living in the nearby WEM Tower have suggested they were unaware of the plans before they moved in and are concerned about the inconvenience. READ NEXT: The 'nightmare' South London street where traffic chaos is so bad 'five cars have been hit and written off' One said: Due to the changed ways of working during the pandemic, I intentionally chose this place to rent based on what is offered here (far from city noises, sunlight, a high-rise building that is not surrounded by any obstructions, etc.). This construction changes all of these factors based on which I made my decision. Designs show the three buildings would be made up of one 32-storey skyscraper with 266 flats, comprising 84 one-bedroom, 178 two-bedroom and four three-bedroom apartments - all of which are earmarked for private sales. 'Building B' is a three-storey low-rise block containing a gym, currently intended to be used by Stonebridge Boxing Club. The third building would be a part 16, part 20-storey tower block containing a mixture of private and affordable homes. The total 249 apartments would comprise 16 one-bedroom, 58 two-bedroom and 75 three-bedroom, as well as four commercial units on the ground floor. Nearby residents are fearful the development will drastically impact their quality of life by resulting in a loss of sunlight and privacy, as well as the flats adversely affecting the feeling of community and neighbourliness. There are also concerns about the impact on local infrastructure, particularly the nearby Stonebridge Park station which serves the London Underground, London Overground and National Rail. One resident said: The train station nearby is small and already struggles during peak hours for the existing number of residents in the area. Ditto for bus stops and buses that serve the area - the number of new residents being proposed is absurd for such an area. If the plans are approved, the developer has pledged to provide 1.02m towards station improvements at Stonebridge Park and bus service enhancements. This will be essential as the proposal is 'car free', with the exception of blue badge parking, meaning more strain will be put on local public transport. Cycle parking and a new cycle lane has been proposed along the southern boundary. A total of 116 affordable units, on a 70:30 split of London Affordable Rent to London Shared Ownership, would be provided. Officers suggest evidence shows this is the maximum amount of affordable housing that can be viably provided on site, and would, therefore, be policy compliant. The plan has been recommended for approval by planning officers but it will come before Brent Council's planning committee next week (October 24) for a final decision.

West was due to perform at the open-air venue in Reggio Emilia on Friday and organisers had been in talks with local authorities about the gig all last week. Initially it had been due to take place on October 20 but with 100,000 fans expected and a rail strike planned for the Italian network it was decided to postpone the event. Officials also took into account that heavy rain is forecast in the area on Friday evening and with no shelter, the open-air venue risked becoming a mud bath. A spokesperson for the Reggio Emilia prefecture said:'Given the fact that a rail strike was planned the same day, and that heavy rain is due it was thought prudent to postpone the event. EXCLUSIVE: Kanye West's controversial Italian gig - set to take place on Friday - has been postponed following protests from war veterans who have slammed him for praising Hitler Will still go ahead: 'The organisers have been given an alternative date of October 27 and we are waiting to hear back if it is acceptable to them' 'Our aim to ensure the safety and security of all and if there is a transport issue then the concert cannot go ahead safely and as it is open air the heavy rain forecast would have also created problems. 'The organisers have been given an alternative date of October 27 and we are waiting to hear back if it is acceptable to them.' Security is expected to be tight as MailOnline highlighted how local veterans' groups were angry the gig was even being touted because of West's praise for Adolf Hitler and Nazism. In a shock interview last year West said: 'Every human being has something of value they brought to the table, especially Hitler. 'I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis. There is a lot of things that I love about Hitler, a lot of things, I like Hitler, I am a Nazi.' Albertina Soliani, vice president of (ANPI) National Association of Italian Partisans, stormed: 'It is time to say enough to these people who believe they can say what they want. 'Someone can be a fantastic singer but then they are also judged by what they say, and West has made some inhumane declarations and with what is happening in the world today we cannot accept this concert. 'We are focused every day with carrying certain values, which are liberty and democracy and then with this we just have to start again from the beginning. In an interview last year West said: 'Every human being has something of value they brought to the table, especially Hitler (Kanye pictured arriving at Milan fashion week in September) His love: West - who has now changed his name to Ye - has been in Italy on an extended holiday with his wife Australian Bianca Censori since August 'In my opinion he should stay at home, Reggio Emilia has always appreciated people who have fought for determine principles and we are on the side of the oppressed and not those who preach hate.' Ermete Fiaccadori, ANPI regional president for Reggio Emilia, blasted West and said: 'First of all let me just say that I hope this concert does not go ahead, this artist has a large following of youngsters, but his message is disquieting. 'I am speechless that he cannot understand what he Is saying, broadcasting a gross misunderstanding of what Adolf Hitler was in the course of history. 'I am all for artistic liberty but what Kanye West says and does leave me shocked. 'As an organisation we condemn this concert totally and we are very concerned about what message it conveys. 'And before anyone says it, this is not censorship because we are all in favour of liberty, but we are talking about a concert that is totally out of order. 'Reggio has a long history of fighting against the ideas of Adolf Hitler, and many lost their lives as a result.' West, 46, has been in Italy with Australian Italian wife Bianca Censori, 28, since August and is said to be working on a new album at a recording studio in Milan. In March 1944, at Cervarolo, just 40 miles from Reggio Emilia, the Nazis butchered 24 people including the village priest in retaliation for partisan activity. In a hard-hitting editorial on its website ReggioOnline blasted the idea of the gig saying: 'Do we really want this?' and highlighted how the star has been involved in controversy since being in Italy. It added: 'West is capable of selling thousands of tickets in just a few minutes, of moving an enormous amount of money, of creating an event that will reach millions of people overnight through streaming. 'Is it right that Kayne West sings in Reggio Emilia in the name of art and its ability to attract a large audience? 'This is a city that takes its students to see the extermination camps on memory trips so that those atrocities are never repeated again. 'This is a city in which the values of the person, of human dignity, and of respect for others are not questioned and are also remembered. 'This is the city where children are not sent to ovens to burn but are exalted through an education system that the world copies from us. 'In the name of money, many justifications can be put on the table: from the phrase if he did not sing in Reggio, he would sing elsewhere to the more subtle one: all artists sing questionable phrases. Not happy: Local veterans' groups representing former partisans who fought against the Nazis and Hitler as well as Italian dictator Benito Mussolini have blasted the concert Big project: Trucks have been coming and going from the RCF Arena at Reggio Emilia near Bologna for several days and on Thursday a private jet landed at a nearby airstrip and a car with blacked out windows was seen heading to the venue 'If West performs in Reggio Emilia, he will certainly fall within the logic of a market that does not look at what is sung but at what it produces. 'However, do not forget that words, in addition to producing money, when they are dangerous and violent, produce damage to the brains of many people. But this is obviously of little or no interest.' Last year West brought out an album called Donda which was named after his mother, and he is said to be in Italy working on the follow up. Music forums suggested the concert if not given the go ahead will be a 'listening event' where instead of performing in front of a live audience it would be streamed online. Donda - which was West's 10th album - was named after his mother Donda C West who died in 2007 aged just 58. West last performed live in Italy in August when he appeared before 60,000 fans at a Travs Scott gig in Rome - and it was his first appearance since making a stream of anti-Semitic comments. Dressed all in black and barefoot West sang Praise God from Donda as well as his 2007 anthem Cannot Tell Me Nothing. That concert hit the headlines after 60 people needed hospital treatment when pepper spray was let off, while locals feared an earthquake as jumping fans triggered intense vibrations registering 1.3 magnitude.",https://expressdigest.com/exclusive-kanye-wests-controversial-italian-gig-has-been-postponed-following-protests-from-war-veterans-who-slammed-him-for-praising-hitler/,-1

A yellow weather warning has been issued by the Met Office, with roads and public transport set to be badly affected by the conditions. Here is everything you need to know as the storm approaches... A yellow weather warning covers the whole of Ayrshire from 6am on Thursday through until 6am on Saturday. The original warning, issued on Monday, was in place from Wednesday, October 18, but this has since been revised. Spray and flooding will develop on roads, with potential disruption to journey times and some areas prone to flooding could be badly affected. The Met Office said: While there is still some uncertainty in detail, there is the potential for periods of heavy, prolonged and potentially disruptive rainfall to develop on Thursday and perhaps continue into Saturday across parts of the area. Widely 20 to 40mm of rain is expected, but some upland areas of northern England and Scotland could see as much as 70-100 mm of rain. A separate amber warning is in place for parts of eastern Scotland where higher rainfall amounts are likely to cause greater impacts. The rain will be accompanied by very strong southeasterly winds across parts of Scotland, which could exacerbate impacts. The BBC says persistent and heavy rain will be most extreme in central and eastern Scotland. Train services could be severely affected by the incoming weather, with Network Rail planning ahead for potential disruption on the network. Strong winds could cause wave overtopping along the Ayrshire coastal line, which could disrupt services between Glasgow, Ardrossan and Largs.",https://www.irvinetimes.com/news/23861498.explained-ayrshire-can-expect-storm-babet-approaches/,-1
