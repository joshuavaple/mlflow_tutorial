The rail operator said that on Thursday, services between Glasgow Queen Street and Aberdeen  Inverness, and between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen  Inverness will be affected by the suspensions. It comes as Storm Babet is expected to hit parts of Scotland on Thursday, with life-threatening downpours forecast. Due to the red weather warning and the likelihood of flooding and poor driving conditions, customers on these routes are advised not to travel as no alternative transport is available. The train operator expects the line closures to last until early Saturday, October 21, however this is dependent on weather conditions and any repair work to railway infrastructure that is required. Other routes across the network will be impacted by precautionary speed restrictions, meaning services may be subject to delay or cancellation. The full list of suspended services are as follows: Customers are advised that they should only travel if necessary on the routes affected by the weather warnings, to expect delays, and to check their journey before travelling on the ScotRail website, mobile app, or social media channels. Customers whose journey has been cancelled or disrupted due to adverse weather can travel one day before or two days after the date on their ticket. Customers can also apply for a fee-free refund on any unused tickets. David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: The Met Office has issued red and amber weather warnings for Storm Babet, with heavy rain across eastern Scotland, and heavy rain and high winds in central and northern Scotland. We know the impact that the withdrawal of some train services will have on customers, but our first priority is always to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. This is a necessary step to ensure everyone is safety during the severe weather. In order to keep our customers and staff safe, speed restrictions will be in place as a precautionary measure on other routes in Scotland, which will mean longer journey times. For routes in the south and west of Scotland, customers are encouraged to check their journey before setting off, and keep an eye on our website, mobile app, or social media channels for live updates. Storm Babet is set to bring a month's worth of rain within 48 hours across parts of the country. Areas of Angus will see up to two months of rain fall over the same time frame. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is very likely there will be a risk to life.",-1

President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the other team was behind the blast, citing data he had been shown by the YOU.S. Defense Department. Preliminary estimates of deaths at Al Ahli Arab Hospital vary from 200 to 800, World Health Organization officials said at an emergency press conference late Tuesday. Injuries were estimated to be in the hundreds as well. Aside from patients and health care workers, many civilians were also sheltering in and around the hospital, expecting it to be spared from attacks, as mandated by international humanitarian law. Palestinian officials had been quick to say it was an Israeli airstrike, but the Israel Defense Forces say that intelligence traces the attack to a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. As he met with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday, Biden said it appeared as though the attack was done by the other team, according to multiple news outlets. But before Biden departed for the meeting, the YOU.S. government had not yet drawn a conclusion as to who was to blame for the bombing, CNN reported Wednesday, citing an anonymous YOU.S. official. The question of who was behind the attack has massive implications, with the Arab world in particular on edge, with protests in support of Palestine in many neighboring countries. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was midair during the organization's emergency press conference Tuesday, but expressed his shock and condemnation through Dr. Michael Ryan, the organization's executive director of health emergencies, who spoke for him. But Ghebreyesus tweeted shortly after the attack, condemning it and calling for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, as well as for Israel's evacuation order for northern Gaza to be reversed. Al Ahli Arab Hospital was one of 22 hospitals in the north end of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from Israeli forces -- an order the WHO, UN, and other agencies have said is impossible to carry out due to insecurity in the area, the critical condition of many patients, a lack of ambulances, and a lack of alternative shelter, among other factors. Combined, hospitals in northern Gaza were treating more than 2,000 patients, WHO officials said Tuesday. Since the beginning of the war October 7, four Palestinian hospitals have been rendered inoperable due to damage or targeting, they said Wednesday, adding that its Gaza warehouse was now barren. Health workers are having to make impossible choices to ration what little they have left in supplies, the agency said in a Wednesday tweet, adding that health workers are operating without anesthetics. Israeli forces on Friday ordered the evacuation of all people in northern Gaza in 24 hours as they prepared for a large-scale ground offensive. As of Wednesday, that offensive had not yet started. Many speculated it would not occur before Biden's meeting with Netanyah on Wednesday. Egypt's Rafah crossing, the only potential entry point into Gaza, remained closed Wednesday, preventing thousands of pounds of humanitarian aid from entering the war-torn territory.",-1

However, according to the previous statement from the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) governor, the 20-baht electric train rides project would be effective December 1st, 2023.

Moreover, it would alleviate a PM 2.5 problem with a Transport Future for All policy: For people, for society, for the environment, and for future generations. Due to the in-process-development system, a cross-platform transportation fare between the Purple Line and the Red Line would need to be paid separately.

With the water chest high in Midleton's Darling Buds pre-school, a spokesperson for the creche said that adults helped remove children by piggy back after staff and children became trapped inside. Similarly, parents had to wade through waters at the Educate Together National School to collect their children. The main road in Midleton was under 3ft feet of water, while the town itself saw roads both in and out of the area become impassable after the Owenacurra River burst its banks -- requiring assistance from the army and civil defence. Problems were exacerbated shortly after lunch time, when the wind and rain caused two power outages, one on either side of the town. ESB engineers were unable to wade through the floods before three more faults were recorded in the afternoon -- including one near the community hospital in the town. Local Councillor Susan McCarthy described bins, traffic cones, benches and even a skip floating on the street. Its even dangerous wading through it, she said. At one stage a man was seen kayaking down the street to check on people trapped in their businesses and homes. Locals stranded Independent Cllr Liam Quaide told the Irish Examiner that the flooding in Midleton really shows our vulnerability to climate change and the need for adaptation as well as mitigation. I was bringing my daughter home from CUH and I cannot get to (our home) in Broomfield, because both ways are blocked. We are stranded in the Market Green centre where some people we have met have been waiting here for several hours to get home. All rail services between Cork and Cobh and Cork and Midleton were suspended due to water on the line. Cork County Council confirmed that more than 100 properties were flooded in the town. One of those belonged to Himalaya Yoga Studio on Mill Road. Maeve O'Brien from the studio said that they had been hit very hard She explained that due to the floods, they could not reach the studio to fully assess the damage. It is a huge blow for all the businesses in Midleton. Ideally, we would open our doors tomorrow but we are not too hopeful of that. Ms O'Brien said it was absolutely crucial that all stakeholders worked together to get a flood relief system in place to prevent future issues. Councillor Danielle Twomey said the flood was the town's worst in living memory. She was one of the parents of children at Midleton's Educate Together School who had to wade through knee-high water along Mill Road to get to the school. We drove our cars as near to the school as we could and then just waded out to the school, she said. I was there to collect my two daughters and although the school itself was not flooded, the road to it was like a river. The water subsided after a while but when we went to collect our children, we had no idea how bad things would be. We did not want to take any chances. So, you had this scene of parents wading through flood waters with children on their backs. I have never seen anything like it in my life. She said several estates and Midleton hospital were under a metre of water and access to Midleton from Cloyne was cut off. A rest centre was established in the town's community centre to facilitate those who required evacuation. Meanwhile, in Killeagh, the historic Thatch pub and restaurant was under a metre of water after the adjacent River Dissour burst through at about 9.30am. Proprietor Debbie Walsh said the water was unstoppable and had nowhere to go as it swept across the beer garden and into the bar, kitchen, and store room. The pub, which dates from the mid 1600s, was almost destroyed by fire prior to Debbie and husband Brian taking it over seven years ago. The force of the water was actually dangerous, Debbie recalls. The devastation has been extremely distressing and we are exhausted, she added, but we will clean up and carry on. We are likely to be closed over the coming days, she added. Imokily GAA secretary Patrick Mulcahy said the flood was the worst in the area and that many older generations have never seen this before. Youghal's town centre escaped flooding but some estates and walls in the town were severely affected. A section of wall that was being restored and scaffolding collapsed on Lighthouse Hill, while a huge pond was created at Chestnut Drive estate, as fast-flowing torrents ran downhill. Resident Shane Tobin said a wall collapse redirected almost two metres of water from the rear of his house at the last minute. Meanwhile, James O'Connor TD, who surveyed flood damage in Midleton, said questions need to be asked about why there was not a red weather warning. The level of damage to Midleton and surrounding areas as far as Glanmire has been devastating There is a real sense of destruction, he said. Business have been flooded, the Defence Forces are here on the street, the community hospital has been evacuated and I see school children being brought up the main street on the back of trailers. People were not expecting this and it begs the question: why there not a red warning provided last night? Where was the red warning? The amount of water has been biblical. Water is running out under doors on the Main Street. It is just soul destroying. The Main Street is ruined. He said that what is needed now is support for families and businesses hit by the flooding. People are needing support and luckily the Park Hotel has started hosting families.",-1

The ministry said traders by October 21 last year had exported 11.5 million tons. The ministry said 1.05 million tons of grain were exported in the first 17 days of October. Ukraine exported 2.83 million tons from October 1-21 a year ago. The ministry gave no explanation for the decrease. Traders and farmers unions have said blocked Ukrainian Black Sea ports and Russian attacks on Ukrainian ports on the Danube River are the main reasons for lower exports. The exported volume included 3.99 million tons of wheat, 3.04 million tons of corn and 654,000 tons of barley. Ukraine has traditionally shipped most of its exports through its deep water Black Sea ports. A deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey allowing such exports collapsed in July when Russia withdrew, saying its demand that sanctions be lifted on its grain and fertiliser exports had not been met. Ukraine's shipping sources said 34 cargo vessels had entered a fledgling Black Sea shipping corridor as Kyiv steps up a push to defy the de-facto Russian blockade. Ukraine can also export limited volumes through small river ports on the Danube and via its western land border with the European Union. Ukraine is expected to harvest 79 million tons of grain and oilseed in 2023, with 202324 exportable surplus totals of about 50 million tons.

The warning is in place for parts of Scotland from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday. Yellow alerts for rain cover eastern England and the rest of Scotland on Friday. The agency said the storm could cause exceptional rainfall reaching up to 250mm. The red warning states there is danger to life from fast flowing or deep floodwater in Aberdeenshire and Angus, with extensive flooding and road closures expected. Humza Yousaf, Scotland's First Minister, said that travel should be avoided unless absolutely essential. Mass rail closures were announced for eastern Scotland until Friday, with lines from Perth to Aberdeen and to Aviemore not running. Network Rail said trains between Aberdeen and Elgin are also cancelled. Aberdeenshire Council alerted residents to significant supplies of sandbags that it had stockpiled to protect their homes from flooding. The red warning alerts people to the danger of communities becoming cut off for days. The last red warning for rain was in February 2020 when Wales was hit by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest recorded levels and more than 1,400 homes and businesses flooded. At least three people died. On Wednesday trains were suspended in Greater Manchester after a tree was brought down onto overhead power lines. Cornwall and Devon were battered by gale force winds and heavy rain with 45mph gusts in coastal areas of the South. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution warned that the storm poses a safety risk to those visiting the coast and that the public should exercise extreme caution, particularly near cliffs, seafronts and piers. In the Devon town of Paignton, several beach huts were destroyed in the extreme weather as waves battered the seafront. Sean White, of watersports company and community club Soak Lifestyle, in Torquay, said on Facebook: One of our shipping containers, our sports one, ended up in the ocean and the other one has been bashed like a washing machine. We have lost everything, and obviously that is totally devastating and we are lacking words among all the emotion right now. Mr White added that he did not account for the storm surge which made an extra metre or so tide that we had not anticipated. He and his business partner Laura Rickard managed to arrange for cranes to save the container that held their coffee shop by lifting it away from the seafront. County Cork in Ireland, where residents posted videos of flooding to social media, experienced 75mm of rainfall across the course of the day, the Met Office said. The area's mayor, Frank O'Flynn, claimed it was equivalent to a month's worth.",-1

One crewmember was reportedly seriously injured and transferred to a local hospital with burns, but the injuries are being called non-life threatening. The cruise ship, the Ocean Navigator (4,954 gross tons) operated by Hornblower Group's American Queen Voyages, had docked in Portland around 7:00 a.m. arriving from Halifax, Canada at the end of a coastal cruise in Canada. The local fire department said it received reports of smoke coming from the ship at around 7:25 a.m. and dispatched its units. By the time they arrived, the crew was controlling the fire and they assisted in ensuring the fire was out. People working at the terminal told local reporters that they saw smoke and believed they heard an explosion from within the ship. The cruise line and YOU.S. Coast Guard are reporting that it was a generator fire and it was contained to the engine room. There were 128 passengers and 82 crew aboard the ship. The passengers were all evacuated into the terminal and according to city officials have now been moved to a local hotel. None of the passengers were injured. A Coast Guard prevention and response team reported to the site as well as the ATF, Maine State Fire Marshall, Maine State Fire Investigator, Portland Fire Department, and Customs and Border Patrol. At the last report, teams were working to vent the cruise ship while an investigation was also underway. The Ocean Navigator was built in 2001 as a modern version of an American coastal cruise ship and was to have been named Cape Cod Light. Her original owners went bankrupt, and she sat idle for years before a series of different operators managed the ship. She is 286 feet in length with accommodations for 202 passengers. The ship was due to spend tonight in Portland and embark passengers tomorrow for a 10-day cruise to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maine before ending in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on October 27. Passengers for the trip have already arrived in Portland and were due to spend tonight in a hotel before boarding the cruise ship. Based on the company's website, the upcoming cruise was her last scheduled trip. Earlier this year, American Queen Voyages announced they would discontinue the operation of the Ocean Navigator and her sister ship Ocean Voyager focusing instead on the company's river cruises. The sister ship Ocean Voyager is in Halifax today and is due to arrive in Portland on October 20. The YOU.S. Coast Guard reported this afternoon that the Ocean Navigator is currently not permitted to sail as there is an ongoing investigation. American Queen Voyages reports they are assessing the damage and local weather conditions to determine if the next cruise will sail as scheduled.",-1

Thirty of the 104 rail cars tumbled off the tracks over the interstate Sunday afternoon, crushing a semi-truck and spilling coal all over the roadway. The train derailed just before 3:30 p.m. as it was crossing I-25 on an overpass 4 miles north of Pueblo, officials said. A semi-truck was crushed in the accident, killing the driver. No injuries were reported for the train crew. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones, Governor Jared Polis, who is scheduled to visit the crash site Wednesday morning, said in a statement. Our immediate priority is safely getting the highway open both ways. The Pueblo County Coroner's office has identified the truck driver as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, CA. He is survived by six children and 15 grandchildren, said his daughter, Endaya Jenel. Governor Polis announced that the closed section of southbound is being re-paved and is expected to re-open this afternoon. CDOT is working to re-open northbound I-25 no later than tomorrow evening and if necessary CDOT may open a single lane prior to re-opening the entire road. Motorists should expect a rough driving surface as the damaged roadway will be milled. There will be slightly reduced speed limits temporarily through the stretch to ensure the safety of drivers. Governor Polis toured the damage with the National Transportation Safety Board alongside local legislators, county leaders, staff from the state's federal delegation, and Mayor Gradisar of Pueblo. The preliminary investigation has revealed that a broken rail just east of the bridge over I-25 likely caused the coal train to derail and the bridge to collapse. Our top priority is to get the highway back open so that people can continue traveling safely between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, and the rest of the state, said Governor Polis. Though the investigation is still ongoing, it remains clear that investments in rail are needed now more than ever and Colorado has been working for months to take advantage of historic safety and rail funding from the federal government.

The Syrian government has announced the resumption of operations at Damascus International Airport as of noon on Wednesday. This decision comes after necessary repairs were carried out to address the damage inflicted by Israeli airstrikes on the airport the previous week. On the afternoon of Thursday, October 12th, Israel conducted simultaneous missile strikes on the international airports of Aleppo and Damascus, resulting in damage to their airstrips and rendering them non-operational. The Syrian state news agency, SANA, quoted an unnamed military source who reported, At approximately 13:50 on Thursday afternoon, the Israeli enemy carried out a coordinated missile attack on the international airports of Aleppo and Damascus, causing significant damage to their runways, forcing them out of service. Axis of Resistance Takes Three Steps to Reassure Israel in Southern Syria On October 13th, the Syrian Ministry of Transport announced the reopening of Aleppo International Airport, effective the following morning. The ministry stated that air traffic at Aleppo Airport would resume after repairs were made to address the damage caused by Israeli airstrikes. The announcement also indicated that airlines could schedule flights and manage passenger services through Aleppo Airport. Additionally, Latakia International Airport would continue to operate as an alternative to Damascus International Airport, which was still undergoing repairs to address the damage caused by the simultaneous Israeli attacks. Subsequently, on October 14th, Israeli aircraft once again targeted the airport, resulting in its closure. However, the Ministry of Transport reported that the airport was able to resume operations on October 16 after necessary repairs were made to the runway. Simultaneous bombardment According to a high-ranking security source who spoke to the Russian agency Sputnik on condition of anonymity, Israeli aircraft launched several missiles from over the occupied Palestinian territories, targeting the vicinity of Damascus airport. Simultaneously, other planes fired guided missiles at Aleppo International Airport from positions over territorial waters off the Syrian coast. In a rare admission, the Israeli army spokesman, as reported by Channel 10, confirmed that the airstrikes on the airports in Aleppo and Damascus were a direct response to mortar shells fired from Syria. The spokesman also issued a warning of further strikes on additional targets in the coming days. As a result of the bombing, the plane carrying the Iranian foreign minister had to alter its course and return to Tehran since it was unable to land at Syrian airports, according to a diplomatic source cited by Sputnik. This marks the second such incident in October. On the 3rd of the same month, Israeli warplanes conducted an airstrike in eastern Syria, specifically targeting military sites near Deir-ez-Zor governorate. This attack resulted in injuries to military personnel, as reported by SANA.",-1

The body of Robert Paul Owens, 34, was found on October 10 at an abandoned log cabin used by several law enforcement agencies for trainings on Shue Road in the small town of China Grove, about 35 miles northeast of Charlotte, the China Grove Police Department said. One day prior, on October 9, a groundskeeper saw the body as he was mowing the property, but believed the body was a fake dummy used for training and as a result did not report it, police said. A construction worker on the property reported the body to police the following day. Haley Shue, Owens sister, told NBC News her family is heartbroken that her brother's body was not reported sooner. The body was exposed for so long they will not be able to have an open casket memorial for him, she said. She remembered her brother as a kind person whoadored his nieces and nephews. The family suspects foul play in his death, she said. Shue said her family last saw Owens on Sunday October 8. That day he spent time with a friend, went to a gas station and got a ride from a friend back to his grandmother's house where he lived. Later, he was picked up by someone to visit another friend, but did not return home. The abandoned home where he was found on the lawn is near his grandmother's home, but it is a property he had never been to before, his sister said. She described the property as off the main road, down a long driveway with woods on either side, and not visible to neighbors. On Tuesday October 10, Shue got a call from her mother saying no one had heard from her brother in two days. Later that same day, the family was notified by police that Owens' body was found, identified by his tattoos. But, Shue said, police refused to tell the family where he was found, the state he was in or how he may have died, simply saying he did not have a gunshot wound. As of right now no family member has laid eyes on him since this occurred, Shue said. She and her family took it upon themselves to find the house where his body was found, where they found a construction worker who reported Owens' body to police. He said he found Owens face down in his underwear and socks with one arm under him, one arm out with marks on his arms that he took as what looked to be defensive marks, Shue said. You can only think what is running through our mind. He does not have any of his clothes, where is his clothes? Where is his belongings? Where is his wallet, his cellphone, shoes and all that? she said. That construction worker told Shue and her family that the groundskeeper saw Owens' body the day before. His words were that the groundskeeper assumed that my brother was Halloween decor or a mannequin and I guess he took it upon himself to assume that and not verify and mowed the entire property, Shue said. It just blows our mind how someone can not stop and verify, this is a strange Halloween decoration, or a strange mannequin or dummy, why would officers leave this behind? she added. The family was further frustrated to find that there was no crime scene tape or signs of preserving the scene. We just feel they should have protected the scene for a little while, Shue said. Preliminary findings from an autopsy conducted Friday ruled out any signs of assault or trauma to the body, police said, noting that a toxicology report is pending to determine because of death. There is definitely some sort of foul play. We have been briefly told by police about some glass around his body. We do not know if that glass is from a car or something else, Shue said. There is no broken glass on the house. Now the family is asking for the public to call in with tips if they saw or heard of anything suspicious in China Grove on October 8 that can help solve what happened to Owens. Someone is involved in this and someone knows of this property and knows that the house is there to have brought him there, Shue said. The family has created an online fundraiser to cover Owens' funeral costs. That is something we have to live with, knowing no family ever identified him. No family got to say any final goodbyes to him. We just want to bring awareness to it, Shue said. We miss him dearly.",-1

Ukrainian forces used US-supplied long-range ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) missiles for the first time, inflicting heavy damage on two airfields in Russian-occupied areas, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying on Tuesday (Oct 17) that the weapons had proven themselves. The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately -- ATACMS proved themselves, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the US administration for ATACMS. Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Zelenskiy's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 190 miles (310 km). The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a US Army website says. Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a new chapter of the war had begun. There are no more safe places for Russian troops within the ... internationally recognised borders of Ukraine, he wrote on X. Russian military bloggers commented on the attacks during the day, with Telegram channel Fighterbomber saying Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS. Citing two unidentified US officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS for the first time on Tuesday. Since starting a counteroffensive in June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in Russian-occupied areas, but it has failed to liberate significant territory from Russian occupation. Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern group of forces, told national television that there had been no letup in Russia's week-old assault on the devastated town of Avdiivka in the east, with Ukrainian forces repelling 10 attacks. Shtupun also said Ukrainian forces advancing southward to the Sea of Azov had registered partial success west of Verbove, one of a cluster of villages it is trying to capture. The Ukrainian military said Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter.",-1

(KDVR) -- Gov. Jared Polis announced Wednesday that the I-25 southbound lanes affected by the October 15 deadly train derailment north of Pueblo will reopen on later this afternoon. The northbound lanes are expected to reopen Thursday afternoon, hopefully in the afternoon, according to Polis. Polis was in Pueblo to view the deadly train derailment site, which killed a 60-year-old Californian truck driver when his semi-trailer was crushed under the bridge. Federal investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board released preliminary findings on Tuesday, showing that a broken rail likely caused the crash. BNSF, the rail company operating the train, told reporters the railway was inspected earlier on Sunday, before the derailment. Specific to this area, BNSF conducted a combination of rail detection testing, advanced track infrastructure testing and visual inspections within the last three months, including the most recent inspection that occurred on Sunday, October 15 prior to the derailment, said Lena Kent, BNSF general director of public affairs. The closure of I-25 has forced drivers to detour through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. A nine-mile stretch of the highway has been closed as crews work to remove debris.",-1

The derailment sent 30 railcars off the tracks, collapsing the steel bridge on top of a passing tractor-trailer, crushing the cab and killing the 60-year-old driver inside. Federal investigators are now examining the fatal incident and why it happened despite the warning systems in place. The fatal derailment last Sunday left a nine-mile stretch of Interstate 25 closed near Pueblo, Colorado, according to the Associated Press. The closure is expected to last the next few days as the bridge's wreckage, crumpled railcars and tons of coals still block the roadway. While assessing the bridge and highway damage will be a priority once the debris is cleared, investigators will look into how the systems in place to prevent derailments like this failed. The AP reports: The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection and did not immediately respond to emailed questions or requests to view its inspection records. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of the railway's main routes between Denver and Texas, where BNSF is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. It will be vital for investigators to determine precisely when the rail broke. If the track came apart when the train was traveling over it, then there was nothing the crew could have done to avoid the derailment. If not, then the focus will shift toward the automated warning systems. All possibilities for a because are still on the table including intentional sabotage and vandalism.",-1

A 4.2 magnitude earthquake was felt across California's Sacramento County and parts of the Bay Area on Wednesday morning, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The quake hit southern Sacramento at 9:29 a.m, exposing the towns of Rio Vista and Isleton to 'Moderate' shaking. It was initially estimated to be magnitude 5.7, but was downgraded. There was light shaking across 5 nearby towns, including Oakley and Discovery Bay, and weak shaking in Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose, said the USGS. There have been no reports of damage or injury. An emergency alert instructing people to Drop, Cover, and Hold On was sent to mobile phones across the area, reported NBC affiliate KCRA. The San Francisco Bay Area train service BART delayed trains for 5-8 minutes to conduct track inspections. The earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 6.7 miles from the earth's surface, according to the USGS. The intensity of shaking during an earthquake diminishes as the depth increases. That is why the 4.8 magnitude earthquake which hit California at a depth of 19.2 miles on Monday had a lower impact. The earthquake struck just a day before the statewide Great California ShakeOut earthquake drill, where 10.1 million people across the state will practice how to be safer during large earthquakes. According to the California Earthquake Authority, most Californians live within 30 miles of one of the more than 500 active fault lines running across the state. USGS estimates say there is 75 chance that at least one 7.0 magnitude or greater earthquake strikes Southern California in the next 30 years.",-1

Cork City and county bore the brunt of the massive rainfall, with homes flooded, roads closed, businesses forced to shut and many properties left without electricity. Emergency personnel have been working tirelessly over a 24-hour period rescuing people from their homes, motorists trapped in cars and trying to pump flood waters from roads and estates. Such was the extent of the apocalyptic rainfall that members of the Defence Forces had to be deployed to parts of East Cork. Streets and all the quays in the city centre were flooded, with motorists warned not to drive into the city as cars were forced to be abandoned on the southside. Meanwhile, a family had to be rescued from their apartment on South Terrace. Towns and villages throughout the country were particularly badly hit, with Midleton and Glanmire seeing severe flooding, resulting in the closure of businesses. Midleton town was completely cut off with flood waters entering businesses and homes, while many properties had been evacuated. The flood water was so high it was touching the roofs of parked cars, and people could be seen wading through the floods in the area with water lapping around their waists, including one man carrying a Labrador dog. Shocking images have also emerged of flooding on the inside of Midleton hospital which has suffered significant damage. The town has been badly affected by power outages, with the ESB confirming that almost 1,000 properties are without electricity. In Youghal, a boundary wall in the Chestnut Drive housing estate acted like a burst dam as a huge buildup of water caused it to collapse, resulting in flood water flowing into the estate. Locals reported that water gushed through their homes, destroying furniture and floors. Strong waves destroyed a section of the sea wall between Kinsalebeg and Youghal, and the sea spilt out onto roads in the area, causing extreme traffic disruption. Similarly, housing estates in Glanmire, including Copper Valley, Meadowbrook, and Rivergrove were flooded, and roads in the area were forced to close. The force of the fast-moving floods also completely washed away the road between Cloyne and Ladysbridge. Irish Rail cancelled services between CorkCobh and CorkMidleton due to flooding on the lines. Schools in the city and county were closed, and many workers driving to their employment were unable to get there because of flooded and dangerous road conditions. Cllr Frank O'Flynn, Cork County Mayor, pleaded with people to stay safe. He said: I am especially conscious of the advanced preparations that were undertaken by Cork County Council in mitigating the effects of this event and how, despite every effort, homes, businesses and road users have been impacted. Areas where flood defence schemes have been completed fared far better than others in the face of this deluge. I know from speaking with Council staff that some of the issues they are dealing with are unprecedented, with roads which have never flooded now underwater. I am calling on the people of Cork to please avoid unnecessary travel, take extreme care if you must set off on a journey, and please think of vulnerable road users, especially pedestrians and cyclists. As a Council, we will continue to work across the county, both in a preventative capacity while also dealing with issues as they arise. The results of this weather event will be long felt as we move toward a clean-up phase, but can I please reiterate the importance of staying safe and together we will come through this weather event. Senator Tim Lombard urgently called for emergency funding to be put in place to help local authorities deal with these increased costs to repair road infrastructure and to expand the Humanitarian Assistance Fund to include Southern coastal counties impacted by the storm. He said: Local communities left heavily flood-damaged from Storm Babet's torrential rainfall should have access to immediate emergency funding from separate Government departments. There has been unprecedented damage to homes, businesses, and roads across the southern coastal counties, resulting in serious issues for Southern communities who now need help to repair infrastructure and property. There has been at least 115mm of rain in the last 24 hours, which is the equivalent of one month's rainfall. People have been forced to evacuate their homes, cars have been destroyed, and roads have been made completely impassable. When events like this occur, we need to help in any and every way we can. The stress which families are now under should not be underestimated. It is important an initial assessment of the damage is carried out without delay and an action plan is soon put in place to deal with this damage, particularly with regard to properties, businesses and roads. Cork County Council's Roads Directorate is responsible for the maintenance of the largest road network (12,200 km) of any local authority in the country. The local authority will be under pressure to repair roads across the county, so it is essential that there is emergency funding provided. The local authority needs support in helping those affected, and the most straightforward way of doing this is through the Humanitarian Assistance Fund, which would provide urgent funding to small businesses, sports clubs, community, and voluntary organisations who, through no fault of their own, could not secure flood insurance and have premises that have been damaged by the exceptional weather. A Status Orange rain warning remains in effect for two counties, Wicklow and Wexford, until 8pm tonight as the storm tracks eastwards. Met Eireann said spells of heavy rain and blustery east-to-southeast winds may lead to localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide.",-1

The Israeli attack sparked global condemnation and angry protests around the Muslim world. In the meanwhile US President Joe Biden who is in Israel, pledged solidarity with Tel Aviv in its war against Hamas and backed its account that a blast that killed huge numbers of Palestinians at a Gaza hospital had been caused by Palestinian fighters. Gaza death toll reaches 3,478: Health Ministry At least 3,478 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip since fighting between Hamas and Israel began on October 7, says Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra. Another 12,065 Palestinians have been injured, with 70 percent of the victims being women, children, and the elderly, the ministry said. At least 1,300 others also remain missing under the rubble, including 600 children. Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said: I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I have seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But there is a lot of people out there not sure, so we have got a lot, we have got to overcome a lot of things, Biden added. The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does, and other democracies, and they are looking to see what we are going to do. Palestinian officials said an Israeli air strike hit the hospital, with the Palestinian Authority's health minister accusing Israel of causing a massacre. The catastrophe has inflamed the region. Palestinian ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said rescuers were still pulling bodies from the rubble. Al Jazeera carried footage showing a frantic scene as rescue workers scoured blood-stained debris for survivors. Rescuers and civilians were shown carrying away multiple victims in body bags. A Gaza civil defence chief gave a death toll of 300, while health ministry sources put it at 500. Biden's complex diplomatic mission to the Middle East was supposed to calm the region and shore up humanitarian efforts for Gaza, but after the strike, Jordan cancelled a planned summit with the US president, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Abbas also cancelled plans to meet Biden, as Palestinian security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse anti-government protesters in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah as popular anger boiled. Protests also took place at Israel's embassies in Turkey and Jordan and near the US embassy in Lebanon, where security forces fired tear gas toward demonstrators. Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that a strike on a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians was a shocking crime, adding that Israel should provide satellite images to prove that it was not involved in the attack. The Israeli military urged Gaza City residents to relocate southward on Wednesday, saying there was a humanitarian zone with aid available in Al-Mawasi, 28 km (17 miles) down the coast of the Palestinian enclave. The IDF calls on GazaCity residents to evacuate south for their protection, said a social-media post by the military. Speaking to reporters as Biden flew to Tel Aviv, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Biden would put tough questions to Israeli leaders but did not give details. Biden will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet seeking to get a sense of Israel's plans and aims, Kirby said. He also aims to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, where millions of Palestinians are surviving with scant food, fuel and water due to Israel's siege. He will be asking some tough questions, he will be asking them as a friend, as a true friend of Israel, but he will be asking some questions of them, Kirby said. It was unclear what Biden could accomplish during his visit. Kirby said the US president planned to speak with Abbas and Sisi on his way back to Washington. This sort of murky but horrific event makes diplomacy harder and increases escalation risks, said Richard Gowan, UN director at International Crisis Group. Biden has previously said the United States does not want the conflict to flare up into a wider war. Iran has warned Israel of escalation if it failed to end aggressions against Palestinians. The US State Department told Americans not to travel to Lebanon after exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon's south. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified by hundreds of people killed in Tuesday's strike on the hospital. Guterres appealed to Hamas for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and to Israel to allow immediate unrestricted access to humanitarian aid for Gaza. WHO says it has no supplies or equipment left in Gaza warehouse The World Health Organisation has said it has no supplies or equipment left at its Gaza warehouse and hospitals were relying on their last reserve of supplies. In a post on X, it said four out of 35 hospitals were not functioning. Health workers are having to make impossible choices to ration what little they have left in supplies, incl. operating without anaesthetics, WHO said. 'Nobody knows': Palestine Red Crescent Society chief on Gaza aid The director general of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Marwan Jilani, has said nobody knows whether humanitarian assistance would get into the besieged Gaza Strip. There are preparations, yes, he told Al Jazeera when asked about the aid deliveries. We are getting ready so that whenever this border crossing opens, we will be using this opportunity to get critical relief for the people inside Gaza, especially for the patients, the hospitals, and the people at large, Jilani added. UN Security Council has 'not fulfilled its responsibility' in Gaza: Erdogan Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has criticised the United Nations Security Council for its failure to pass a resolution in favour of a pause in Israeli forces' continued attacks on Gaza so that aid could reach civilians. In a post on X, Erdogan said Turkish efforts to establish calm in the region had been hindered by the wholesale punishment being given to the Palestinians, cutting off aid supply as well as the deployment of US aircraft carriers in the region. The United Nations Security Council, which has become even more ineffective, has once again not fulfilled its responsibility, Erdogan said. Western countries, which leave no stone unturned when it comes to human rights and freedoms, have taken no steps other than adding fuel to the fire, he added. Bahraini police crackdown on pro-Palestine protest Bahraini police appear to have cracked down on a small demonstration in Manama in support of Palestinians in Gaza, a video on X (formerly Twitter) posted by the Bahrain Center for Human Rights shows. The handful of activists gathered in front of the cordoned-off Israeli embassy were calling for Bahrain to break off diplomatic ties with Israel and to expel its ambassador, the rights group said. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Beirut sprayed with water cannon, teargas Lebanese security forces used teargas and water cannon to repel scores of protesters demonstrating near the US embassy in Beirut against Israel's attack on a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians, Reuters reports. Demonstrators were prevented from reaching the embassy's boundary by barricades blocking roads hundreds of metres (yards) from the mission in a north Beirut suburb. Some protesters waved Palestinian flags while others hurled stones at the security forces, who pushed them back with water cannon and volleys of teargas. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators in The Hague urge ICC action Several hundred pro-Palestinian protesters gathered outside The Hague headquarters of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to urge it and the international community to take action against what they call genocide against Palestinians, Reuters reports. We are against killings of any (parties), however when it comes to Gaza the world is always (turning) a blind eye. We came here to say enough is enough, Rafat Alkayyali, 50, said, adding that he came to the ICC to protest because he believes in international law. Protesters carried signs that said: Justice for Palestine -- Stop the Genocide and How many children will die until Israel is prosecuted. Delhi University students burn Israeli flags to protest atrocities in Gaza: journalist Indian journalist Alishan Jafri has shared a video on X that shows students of Delhi University burning Israeli flags to protest atrocities in Gaza. Saudi Arabia urges citizens to depart Lebanon 'immediately' Saudi Arabia has called for all its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately as tensions mount along Lebanon's southern border with Israel, Reuters reports. The Gulf kingdom's embassy in Beirut said it was closely following the developments in southern Lebanon, where at least 18 people have been killed in exchanges of fire between Hezbollah fighters and Israel. After a rocket strike on a Gaza hospital killed hundreds on Tuesday, Hezbollah called for a day of rage. Hundreds of Hezbollah supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs to protest the strike.

French court rules pro-Palestinian protests should be banned case by case France's highest administrative court has said pro-Palestinian protests must be banned on a case-by-case basis, while upholding the validity of an instruction from the French interior minister banning all pro-Palestinian protests. In a note sent to regional police authorities, dated Oct 12, the interior minister had ordered that pro-Palestinian protests, because they are likely to generate disturbances to public order, must be banned, Reuters reports. The appeal on the blanket ban instruction was brought by the organisation Comite Action Palestine, arguing that a total and absolute ban is not justified and encroaches on freedom of expression and assembly. The Conseil d'Etat upheld the validity of the note but said that local authorities could not ban a protest based solely on the note or the fact that a protest is in support of Palestinians. 'Imagery, intercepts' show Israel not behind Gaza strike: White House US intelligence based on aerial images and intercepted communications shows Israel was not to blame for a strike on a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds, the White House has said.

The meeting was co-convened by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to discuss the crisis in Gaza, according to the Foreign Office. In a press release afterwards, the FO said Jilani strongly denounced the Israeli aggression and inhumane blockade of Gaza that has resulted in death, destruction and displacement. He condemned yesterday's massacre of innocent civilians in the vicious Israeli attack on a hospital in Gaza and underscored that the Israeli occupation forces were in clear violation of international humanitarian and human rights law, and their indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, it said. The FO said Jilani emphasised that Israel must bring an immediate end to its campaign of terror with an immediate ceasefire, lifting the siege of Gaza, and rescinding the forced evacuation of Palestinians from their homes. He also underlined the urgency of humanitarian corridors for rapid, secure and unrestricted humanitarian and relief supplies to Gaza. Biden administration staffers feel 'stifled' discussing horrors in Gaza: report Several US officials have said they feel stifled about having a full debate on what is happening in Gaza, particularly Israeli restraint on Palestinians, according to a HuffPost report. Staffers of the Bident administration, most of whom work on national security issues, told the news outlet that they and their colleagues worry about retaliation at work for questioning Israel's conduct amid the US-backed Israeli campaign on Gaza after the Oct 7 Hamas attack. HuffPost said the fear was especially intense among officials with Muslim backgrounds. On Sunday, presidential personnel office chief Gautam Raghavan organised a call with close to a dozen current and former high-level Muslim appointees to discuss their concerns. Some staffers said they felt unsafe voicing their opinions around colleagues, according to a person on the call, which has not been previously reported, the report said. A career civil servant described the tension between their commitment to challenging rights abuses and their job. Meanwhile, the report said White House officials are planning to hold a listening session with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian staff to hear from them directly in the coming days.

Gaza's poetic goodbye to its twin city, Barcelona, is a haunting reminder that we could be witnessing the end of an entire people. She called on Pakistanis to advocate for Palestinians and keep the fight going.

Germany's Scholz vows action after Molotovs thrown at Berlin synagogue German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has vowed to fight anti-Semitism on German soil after attackers hurled two Molotov cocktails at a Jewish synagogue in Berlin early today. Police in the German capital said they are probing the attack in the Mitte district of the city. There are no reports of injuries or damage. The attack, at around 3:45am, comes amid a sharp increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the wake of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Two unidentified people came on foot and threw two burning bottles filled with liquid in the direction of the synagogue on Brunnenstrasse, a commercial and residential street, police said in a statement. The strike on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City last night killed at least 500 Palestinians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The images emerging in the aftermath are haunting.

EU 'cannot accept' Israel illegally halting water to Gaza: Borrell The European Union cannot accept Israel stopping water supplies to Gaza's population, which clearly violates international law, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said. Suspending the water supply to a community under siege is contrary to international law. But we cannot accept that, he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, AFP reports. That was the EU's position when it came to Ukraine, where Russian forces besieged communities and cut off water, and it should be the same when it came to Gaza, he added. It is clearly stated that depriving a human community under siege of a basic water supply is contrary to international law -- in Ukraine and in Gaza. And if we are unable to say so, for both places, we lack the moral authority necessary to make our voice heard, Borrell said. The World Health Organisation has urged against any attacks on healthcare centres, a day after a Gaza hospital strike that killed almost 500 people. We call... at a minimum to stop any attacks on healthcare facilities, the head of the who is European branch, Hans Kluge, told AFP in an interview.

'Help us, help us!': A doctor's account of the hospital attack The scenes of destruction from the hospital were horrific even by the standards of the past 12 days, which have confronted the world with relentless images, first of Israelis slaughtered in their homes and then of Palestinian families buried under rubble from Israel's retaliatory strikes. People came running into the surgery department screaming, 'Help us, help us, there are people killed and wounded inside the hospital!' said Dr Fadel Naim, Head of the hospital's Orthopedic Surgery Department. The hospital was full of dead and wounded, dismembered bodies, and dead, he told Reuters. We tried to save whoever can be saved but the number was too big for the hospital team to be able to save... We saw them alive but we could not help them and they were martyred. This place created a safe haven for women and children, those who escaped the Israeli bombing, another doctor at the hospital, Ibrahim Al-Naqa, told Reuters. We do not know what the she will is called but we saw the results of it when it targeted children and ripped their bodies into pieces. Scottish first minister offers sanctuary to Gazans Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf has offered sanctuary to Palestinians, in a rare gesture coming from the Western world. Water is running out in Gaza: UNRWA Tamara Alrifai, from the UN Relief and Works Agency, has said water in Gaza is running out and people, especially babies, are dehydrated.

Israel tells citizens to leave Turkey 'as soon as possible' Israel has told its citizens to leave Turkey immediately amid fears of reprisal attacks after the deadly strike on a hospital in the Gaza Strip, a consular spokesperson confirmed to AFP. All Israelis staying in Turkey must leave as soon as possible, Israel's National Security Council announced late on Tuesday. I can confirm that the travel warning of the National Security Council to Turkey has been raised to 4, the highest level, the spokesperson told AFP. Thousands joined protests in Istanbul and the capital Ankara outside Israel's diplomatic missions to condemn the attack. Turkish police detained five protesters for attempting to sneak into the Israeli consulate in Istanbul, the governor's office said. Providing aid to Gaza a matter of 'life or death': UN relief chief Providing aid to the people of Gaza -- wherever they are -- is a matter of life or death, said United Nations Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths. In a post on X, he said doing the same in a sustained, unimpeded and predictable manner is a humanitarian imperative. Iran calls for Islamic countries to sanction Israel Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) should sanction and implement an oil embargo on Israel, in addition to expelling Israeli ambassadors, a statement issued by Iran's foreign ministry quotes Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian as saying. An urgent meeting of the OIC, co-convened by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, is under way in Jeddah for Islamic countries to discuss the Israeli-Hamas conflict. Egypt 'did not close' Gaza crossing to aid, Sisi says President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Egypt did not close the only border crossing with Gaza not under Israel's control, blaming Israeli bombardments for it not operating, AFP reports. Developments on the ground and the repeated bombings by Israel of the Palestinian side of the crossing have prevented operations, Sisi told reporters. Aid convoys have been waiting for six days on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, which has been bombed four times by Israel since the Oct 7 Hamas blitz. Biden backs Israel account of Gaza hospital strike US President Joe Biden, who is on a solidarity visit to Israel, has backed the ally's account that Palestinian fighters caused a devastating hospital strike in Gaza, AFP reports. I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what I have seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you, Biden said as he opened a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. But there is a lot of people out there not sure so we have to overcome a lot of things, the US president said. Biden added that he is encouraging Netanyahu to ensure life-saving capacity to help the Palestinians who are innocent and caught in the middle of this. World reacts to air strike on Gaza hospital killing hundreds A strike resulted in the deaths of at least 500 Palestinians at the crowded Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to the health ministry in the besieged enclave. The strike, which Palestinian officials said came from Israel, was denied by Tel Aviv. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instead blamed barbaric terrorists for the attack. US President Joe Biden said in his official statement that he was outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was horrified by the loss of life at Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, he said in a post on his official X account. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified after the deaths of hundreds of people in a strike on a hospital in Gaza. My heart is with the families of the victims. Hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law, he said in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. In another post, he called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Middle East to ease the epic human suffering. Too many lives -- and the fate of the entire region -- hang in the balance, Guterres said. PM Kakar says Israel must be held accountable for 'war crimes' Reacting to the strike which killed hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar demanded that Israel be held accountable for its war crimes. Targeting a hospital, a sanctuary for those in need, is an indefensible act of inhumanity. International humanitarian law give protection to hospitals and medical personnel, he said. He demanded an end to indiscriminate targeting and urged the international community to act swiftly to stop the violence and hold those accountable responsible. Kakar, who is in Beijing for the third Belt and Road Forum, also mentioned interacting with the UN secretary general. I urged him that global community should ask Israel to stop killing innocent Palestinians, he said. In a subsequent post, he said that Israel must be held accountable for its war crimes as it continues its unrelenting bombardment and siege of Gaza that has resulted in death, destruction and displacement. The backers of Israeli occupation need to reconsider their policies which provide impunity to Israeli authorities in carrying out their campaign of terror against the people of Gaza, he said. PM Kakar discusses situation in Gaza with UN chief in Beijing Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar discussed the situation in Gaza with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Beijing. According to a statement released by the PM's Office, Kakar urged UN to play its role in stopping Israeli atrocities against the oppressed Palestinians. European Union (EU) chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday there is no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians in Gaza, AFP reports. The European Commission president told EU lawmakers the facts need to be established on the overnight strike on the Gaza hospital. Von der Leyen said all those responsible must be held accountable. European Council President Charles Michel posted on social media that there was no conceivable reason to strike a facility with innocent civilians and medical staff and said such an attack is not in line with international law. Modi 'shocked' at hospital attack, calls for accountability Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he is deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. In a post on X, he said: Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured. Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible. Pakistani NGOs beset by 'visa denials' in quest to help Gazans As the humanitarian situation in Gaza becomes desperate after days of relentless bombing by Israeli forces, global aid organisations have said the time was running out to save millions of people in the Gaza Strip. Yet, no aid is being allowed inside the besieged enclave. Like global aid agencies, non-governmental organisations in Pakistan are also ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians, but they cite blockade and logistical issues as key challenges. All routes to Gaza are closed. It is all sealed, Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Foundation told Dawn, adding his heart bleeds for the Palestinians. UK university suspends students over Gaza rally Students from the Palestine Society at SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies) have said the university had suspended students following a rally in solidarity with Gaza. The SOAS Palestine Society posted to X saying, URGENT: SOAS University of London, renowned for its so called progressive politics, has officially begun taking steps suspending its own students following a rally in solidarity with Gaza.

Jared Polis hopes to reopen part of I-25 near train derailment on Wednesday,"On Wednesday, Gov. Jared Polis traveled to the site of the deadly train derailment near Pueblo that has shut down both directions of I-25 to give an update on the cleanup efforts and investigation. One person died when a coal train derailed on Sunday. Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, died when the semi he was driving was under the bridge that collapsed when a BNSF Railway coal train derailed on Sunday as it was passing over I-25 a few miles north of the Pueblo city limits. A preliminary report from federal investigators has determined that a broken rail led to the derailment. I-25 has been closed in both directions since the derailment and detours are in place. Polis hopes to have southbound lanes of I-25 reopened on Wednesday afternoon. The goal is to have northbound lanes of I-25 reopen on Thursday. Repairs to the bridge will take longer partly because there is confusion over which entity owns the bridge. BNSF Railway said the state has ownership. The Colorado Department of Transportation said they have conflicting records on the 65-year-old bridge.",-1

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis visited the site of the crash on Wednesday morning and offered his condolences to the loved ones of the semi-truck driver, who was later identified as Lafollette Henderson, 60, from Compton, California. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed on his truck as it passed underneath. Based on the preliminary investigation, a broken rail east of the I-25 bridge likely caused the train, which was carrying coal, to derail and the bridge to collapse. No other vehicles on the road were involved. About a half dozen train cars were scattered across both lanes of I-25. A total of 30 cars derailed. Polis said the closed section of the southbound lanes was repaved on Wednesday and will open in the afternoon hours. It officially reopened around 2:15 p.m. On the northbound side, crews with the Colorado Department of Transportation expect to open the lanes before Thursday evening. Broken rail caused Pueblo train derailment that collapsed bridge, NTSB says Our top priority is to get the highway back open so that people can continue traveling safely between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, and the rest of the state, Polis said. Though the investigation is still ongoing, it remains clear that investments in rail are needed now more than ever and Colorado has been working for months to take advantage of historic safety and rail funding from the federal government. The damaged roadway will be milled, so drivers may notice the road is rough in the area. The speed limit will be temporarily lowered as well. We appreciate the all hands on deck approach to getting this work done quickly, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway taking the lead on rebuilding the bridge safely and efficiently, said CDOT Director Shoshana Lew.

Former Vice President Mike Pence is having an unusually quiet week on the trail after filing a finance report showing his campaign facing money troubles. The usually busy Pence campaign's only public event this week was a pre-planned Tuesday Newsmax town hall in Windsor Heights, Iowa . Pence is not planning to attend Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks' MMM Tailgate in Iowa City Friday -- where much of the rest of the 2024 GOP presidential field will appear, including former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Instead, the Pence campaign says he will be in Dallas for private fundraisers and a Republican National Committee event. Pence's campaign reported only 1.2 million in the bank after the third quarter -- not all of which can even be spent in the 2024 primary. The campaign is already carrying 620,000 in debt, and Pence himself chipped in 150,000 of his own personal money to keep things going in the third quarter. That puts a serious strain on the day-to-day operations of the campaign -- and what is more, Pence also faces a sprint to amass the 70,000 unique donors needed to qualify for the November 8 GOP presidential debate. His campaign has not yet commented on how close it is to meeting the donor threshold, which was a struggle for Pence in the lead-up to the first GOP debate in August.",-1

North Korea appears to have begun secretly shipping large amounts of munitions to Russia, according to a new report, using ships and trains to move the weaponry and bolster Moscow's war against Ukraine. The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said.

India's first semi-high-speed regional rail service -- RAPIDX -- whose trains are equipped with hi-tech features and a number of passenger amenities, is all set for its inaugural run on October 21, a day after the inauguration of the 17-km priority section of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS Corridor. Ghaziabad, Oct 18 (PTI) India's first semi-high-speed regional rail service -- RAPIDX -- whose trains are equipped with hi-tech features and a number of passenger amenities, is all set for its inaugural run on October 21, a day after the inauguration of the 17-km priority section of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS Corridor. The priority section, between Sahibabad and Duhai Depot, has five stations -- Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai Depot. The segment from Duhai to Duhai Depot is a spur from the main corridor. Also Read  Manipur: NHRC Registered 18 Human Rights Violations Cases During Violence in State. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the priority section at the Sahibabad RAPIDX station in Uttar Pradesh on Friday. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Wednesday said he will flag off a RAPIDX train connecting Sahibabad and Duhai Depot stations, marking the launch of the RRTS in India.

The foundation stone for the RRTS Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Corridor was laid by him on March 8, 2019. A media preview of the RAPIDX trains was held on Wednesday ahead of the inauguration of the priority section. A day after the inauguration of the priority section, passenger services will begin from October 21 morning. RAPIDX trains will be operational between 6 am and 11 pm. Initially, trains will be available every 15 minutes, though the frequency can be increased on a requirement basis in the future, an official source told PTI on Tuesday. Every RAPIDX train will have six coaches, including a premium coach. One coach in every train is reserved for women and it is the coach next to the premium coach. Seats in coaches are serially numbered Also, there are reserved seats for women, specially-abled, and senior citizens in other coaches, the officials said. Premium coaches have a seat with a different colour code, a provision for installing a vending machine in future, besides a host of additional commuter-centric features like reclining seats, coat hooks, magazine holders and footrests, officials said on Wednesday. The soon-to-open section of the RRTS Delhi-Meerut Corridor will also facilitate the movement of patients as one general coach in each train will have the space to accommodate a medical stretcher and a wheelchair. Besides, some of the lifts installed at its stations are elongated for extra room to accommodate a stretcher, officials of the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) said. CCTV cameras, an emergency door-opening mechanism and a button to communicate with a train operator are among the safety features in trains that will ply on this section from October 21. For enhanced safety, every RRTS station is equipped with platform screen doors (PSDs). These PSDs are integrated with RRTS train doors and the signalling system. On Wednesday, during the media preview, trains were run on the priority section at a speed up to 130-140 kmph. Speed and station names are displayed on screens installed inside coaches. Trains can operate on this corridor even up to a speed of 160 kmph, but the operational speed will be lesser, a senior official said. A push-button facility on the doors of the trains will allow passengers to board and get off the train when it halts at a station, officials said. This step has been taken as a measure to save energy, they said, adding that the push-button only gets activated after a train comes to a halt at a station. However, initially, the door operation in coaches will be done automatically, and train attendants and ground staff will assist passengers till they fully get used to this system, officials said. Once the corridor gets operationalised, people can commute between Sahibabad and Duhai Depot stations on this line in about 12 minutes, they said. A one-way journey from Sahibabad to Duhai Depot station on the priority section of this RRTS Corridor will cost Rs 50, while the fare for the same route will be Rs 100 in a premium-class coach. If a passenger enters from one station, say Sahibabad station and exits from the same station, then it will cost Rs 20. Children having a height below 90 cm will be allowed to travel free, the NCRTC said. Commuters can buy a paper QR code-based ticket, which can be generated via ticket vending machines (TVM) or bought from ticket counters at the RAPIDX stations, officials said. Unified Payments Interface or UPI-enabled ticket vending machines have been installed to purchase paper QR code-based tickets and recharge the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC). Passengers can use bank notes, bank cards, National Common Mobility Cards and UPI to buy tickets from a TVM, they said. The under-construction RRTS Corridor, being built for a semi-high-speed regional rail service named 'RAPIDX' by the NCRTC, is a joint venture company of the Centre with the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The NCRTC has been tasked to oversee the construction of India's first RRTS, between Delhi and Meerut. The government of Uttar Pradesh has entrusted the responsibility of security of all the stations in the state to the Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force (UPSSF) and the deployment of security force at the stations of the priority section has already been done, another senior official said. The NCRTC has been tasked to oversee the construction of India's first RRTS, between Delhi and Meerut. The entire 82.15 km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS is targeted to be operational by June 2025. The RRTS corridor, once fully operational would cut down the travel time between Delhi and Meerut to around 55 minutes from the current three to four hours by road.",-1

Several landmark studies have been published in the last year highlighting the link between chemical hair relaxers -- which break down proteins in hair to straighten it -- and increased rates of uterine cancer. And last week, after pressure from Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Shontel Brown of Ohio, the Food and Drug Administration said it would propose a ban on hair-smoothing and hair-straightening products containing formaldehyde, an ingredient known to cause cancer. As more research continues to reveal potential dangers, hundreds of Black people have filed lawsuits against big-name beauty and cosmetic retailers like L'Oreal and Revlon, blaming their chemical hair straighteners as causes of uterine cancer, fibroid tumors and infertility. The latest research on the effects of hair relaxers was published October 10 by Boston University. According to the Black Women's Health Study, or BWHS, postmenopausal Black women who have used chemical hair relaxers more than twice a year or for more than five years have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. In following 44,798 Black women for up to 22 years, researchers found a higher rate of uterine cancer among postmenopausal Black women who reported having used chemical hair relaxers for at least 10 years, regardless of frequency. Better grasping Black health and the factors that contribute to racial disparities in cancer was the intent behind the 22-year study. The idea here is that a renewed emphasis or attention to the potential dangers of these products, I hope, will spur policies, and that will sort of help reduce exposure in this population or even help us identify potentially safer alternatives to straighten hair, said the lead author of the study, Kimberly Bertrand, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University Chobanian  Avedisian School of Medicine. Revealing the potential risks of hair relaxers, she said, can help spread awareness and encourage making safer choices. NBC News spoke to Bertrand and other researchers to answer some questions Black people may have about chemical hair straighteners and the potential risks to their health Several studies have found that chemical hair straighteners have harmful effects on the body. Last year, the National Institutes of Health published a major study linking chemical hair straighteners to a higher risk of uterine cancer. The study analyzed data from 33,497 YOU.S. women ages 35 to 74 who were followed for nearly 11 years. During that period, 378 cases of uterine cancer were diagnosed. According to this month's BWHS, women who reported using hair relaxers more than twice a year or who used them for more than five years had a greater than 50 risk of developing uterine cancer compared to those who rarely or never used relaxers, additional data from the study shows. In 2021, the BWHS found that Black women who used hair products containing lye, an ingredient typically found in salon relaxers, at least seven times a year for more than 15 years had a 30 increased risk of developing breast cancer. Among the 50,543 women who participated in the 25-year study, 2,311 participants had developed breast cancer, including 1,843 who developed invasive breast cancers, meaning the cancers spread into surrounding breast tissue. While Black women have a 4 lower incidence rate of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a 40 higher breast cancer death rate, according to the American Cancer Society. Other studies have shown that hair relaxers can cause fibroids and an early onset of puberty in girls, Bertrand said. Early puberty can increase the risk for metabolic syndromes such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Chemical hair relaxers contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can disrupt the functions of the endocrine system (which includes the thyroid, ovaries, pancreas and adrenal glands) and affect hormone levels. These chemicals include phthalates and parabens, which can be found in relaxers. People can be exposed to them by absorption through the skin or inhaling them in the air. Black women are often exposed to endocrine disruptors by using relaxers, which are applied on the scalp, said Jasmine Abrams, a research scientist at the Yale University School of Public Health. If you have ever gotten a relaxer, you know it usually sits on for a little bit, and most people sort of alert their hair stylist that it needs to be washed out once it starts tingling or burning -- and at that point, you are running the risk of burns, said Abrams, one of the authors of a study this year linking chemical hair straighteners to issues with fertility. And if you are running the risk of burns or any sort of injury with that type of chemical, then you are definitely increasing your risk for absorption. If you do that over time for many, many years, then it can, of course, become continuously problematic. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can also be found in some beauty products like lotions, body washes and perfumes, she added. Parabens, phthalates and other chemicals that are often found in chemical hair straighteners pose a greater risk than other products because of scalp exposure, Bertrand said. Even other chemical hair straighteners marketed as safer to use, including no-lye relaxers, still pose potential risks. In our study, women who reported using non-lye relaxers were pretty much just as likely to report scalp burns as those who use lye relaxer, she said. Hair-straightening products are very poorly regulated by the federal government, Bertrand said, and many mask harmful chemicals under names such as fragrance and preservatives, so women do not really know what they are being exposed to. YOU.S. law does not require the Food and Drug Administration to approve cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives, before they go on the market, according to the FDA website. However, the FDA announced last week that it would propose a ban on hair-straightening and hair-smoothing products containing formaldehyde. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stricter regulations of ingredients in cosmetic products and using alternative methods like heat straightening may help reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, Bertrand said. Researchers are not entirely sure. We cannot definitively say that occasional use is entirely safe, said Abrams, an author of the 2023 study about hair relaxers and infertility. Our data essentially suggests that less frequent use is associated with lower risks when compared to regular prolonged use. In Abrams' study -- which included women of different races ages 21 to 45 -- Black women accounted for the greatest population of people who had started using relaxers at age 10 or younger. More than 50 of the Black participants in the study also had used hair relaxers before they reached age 10. Bertrand's study found that postmenopausal Black women had a greater risk of developing uterine cancer if they used hair relaxers more than twice a year or consistently for more than five years. Other factors put Black women at risk for developing uterine cancer, including age, obesity and family and reproductive history, Bertrand added. There are no proven screening mechanisms to detect uterine cancer in the general population, as there are with other diseases like breast cancer, Bertrand said. Women should visit their doctors if they have any symptoms of pain in the pelvic area or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Those with family histories of uterine cancer can also speak to their doctors about genetic testing to identify potential higher risks for certain cancers. In terms of monitoring reproductive health, Abrams said, women can monitor their hormone levels -- either by visiting endocrinologists or mailing in their biospecimens to labs -- and speak with gynecologists about their concerns and ask about taking fertility assessments. In working on an upcoming study on Black women and infertility, she said, many of her participants have described challenges in getting treatment or being heard by their health providers. One of our participants said, 'I felt like the goal among providers has always been to figure out how to keep Black women from getting pregnant, not to help them figure out how to get pregnant,' Abrams said. So she felt like, when she expressed these concerns about her fertility to her provider, she was not taken seriously. Many Black women have consulted with attorneys to sue Revlon, Just for Me and other cosmetics companies, alleging their hair straighteners because cancer, fibroids and other health problems. Strength of Nature, LLC, which owns Just for Me, declined to comment. Larry Taylor Jr., an attorney at The Cochran Firm in Dallas, said thousands of women from their 20s to their 50s have filed suits alleging they developed ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers from using hair relaxers. Revlon declined to comment. Robert Britton, an attorney for the company, said earlier this year that Revlon disputes any link between cancer and its hair relaxer products. Thousands of Black women have also claimed that hair relaxers from L'Oreal were harmful to their health, including a group of Black women who sued L'Oreal and other companies last year. One woman, Bernadette Gordon, who used hair relaxers from 1983 to 2015, experienced uterine and breast cancer resulting in a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy, she previously told NBC News. In July, L'Oreal asked a federal court to dismiss the dozens of consolidated lawsuits against the company, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims were vague and based on unsupported conclusions. The company did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Many Black women straighten their hair to keep their jobs or advance to higher positions, which puts them at risk, Taylor said. This is not a hoax, he said. This is something that is actually harmful and could potentially cost them their lives. Still, there are many unknowns researchers are trying to uncover, including whether the products on the shelves today are going to lead to cases of uterine cancer in the future, Bertrand said. It is also not entirely clear why Black women are at an increased risk of developing and dying from uterine cancer. We continue to explore those factors -- everything from environment to racism to genetics, she said.",-1

The vague language was toughed up later in the day after questions from the media, with Mr Biden saying that his comments backing the Israeli military's assertion that militants in Gaza were responsible for the attack were based on data from my Defense Department. During a final speech before heading back to Washington, the president said it appears the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. The dispute over the source of the explosion on Tuesday evening hung heavily over Biden's visit. Before he arrived, Israeli's military released a flurry of video, audio, and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas. Officials in Gaza have blamed Israel for the blast, claiming that 471 people were killed and 341 wounded. A spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry called it an Israeli massacre. Nations such as Jordan, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey lined to blame Israel for the blast causing the cancellation of what would have been a second leg of Mr Biden's trip, to Jordan, to discuss the situation in Gaza with King Abdullah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. The hospital explosion also became a lightning rod for anger across the Middle East, with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group calling for a day of rage on Wednesday, with protests in the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Iran and elsewhere. That left Mr Biden's trip focused on Israel. Having been hugged on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after landing in Tel Aviv, he ended his trip saying that US will stand forever with Israel will not let you ever be alone. Speaking about the Hamas attack across the border 11 days ago that left around 1,400 people dead and almost 200 hostages believed to be taken by the militants back into Gaza, Mr Biden said it had left a deep, deep wound. Referencing the Holocaust in the Second World War he said the world did nothing but that we will not stand by and do nothing again. He went on to also reference the terror attacks of 911 saying for a nation the size of Israel the Hamas attack was like 15 911s. He said he would ask Congress for an unprecedented aid package for Israel this week to help in its defence. In the wake of the Hamas attack, Israel has launched a near-continuous aerial bombardment of Gaza and a complete siege of the enclave leaving aid unable to get in. The military also called on Palestinians in the enclave of more than two million people to move to southern Gaza ahead of what is expected to be a ground operation, leaving hospitals and shelters overcrowded. That is an evacuation order which rights groups and the UN argue could amount to the war crime of forcible transfer. Mr Biden said that you cannot look at what has happened in Israel and not scream out for justice. but he said that Palestinians in Gaza were also suffering and that while you feel that rage, do not be consumed by it. Earlier this week, the US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, had been working to try and ensure that humanitarian aid would be able to enter Gaza from the border with Egypt, which has been stuck for days. Mr Biden said he had secured a deal for Israel to allow such aid as long as it was inspected before crossing into Gaza, while also announcing 100 million (82m) in humanitarian assistance to help Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. After Mr Biden's remarks, Mr Netanyahu's office said that in light of President Biden's demand Israel will not thwart humanitarian supplies from Egypt as long as it is only food, water and medicine for the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip. The statement did not mention fuel, which is badly needed for power as supplies are dwindling, while there was no timings given for when aid might begin to move into the Strip. The state of the crisis in Gaza is illustrated by the fact patients are being operated on without anaesthetic. Doctors are having to make impossible choices the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned, as it announced its own warehouse of medicine in the strip is now completely empty. Local and general anaesthetics across the strip are on the brink of running out completely, while blood banks only have two weeks of supply left, according to WHO officials. The warnings of failing supplies come amid concerns for those wounded in the hospital blast on Tuesday. The Independent was sent videos showing paramedics tending to the wounded in pools of blood on the floor. Mohamed Ghanem, an emergency doctor at Gaza's largest hospital al-Shifaa, said: There was no operation room any more because of the mass casualties. The doctors tried to do surgeries in the corridors of the hospital without any anaesthesia. Part of the reason for Mr Biden's trip was to try and ensure Israel's war does not spiral into a broader conflict. given the continuing clashes between Israel's military and Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon. Face-to-face time with Arab leaders by Mr Biden was supposed to work on containing the damage, but Mr Biden was unable to achieve that on this trip. The size of the task ahead was also made clear by Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan as he slammed the United Nations Security Council for being unable to pass a non-binding resolution for a humanitarian pause in the conflict between Palestinian and Israeli forces to allow aid to reach civilians in Gaza. In a post on social media platform X, formally known as Twitter, Mr Erdogan said Turkish efforts to establish calm in the region had been hindered by the collective punishment of Palestinians through air strikes and the deployment of US aircraft carriers to the region. The United Nations Security Council, which has become even more ineffective, has once again not fulfilled its responsibility, Erdogan said. As for the UK, Rishi Sunak has called for a calm and cool response to the blast at the Gaza hospital as the government committed to publish an assessment of who was behind the blast. The prime minister urged MPs not to rush to judgment. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the Commons: We take note of what President Biden has said, but we will come to our own judgment, we will work on that quickly, and we will ensure that our assessment is put in the public domain as soon as we are confident of the details.",-1

The Met Office has taken the step of issuing a rare 'red weather warning' amid concerns that the storm could cause severe damage, possibly even posing a danger to life. Laurencekirk, Montrose and Forfar are among the towns covered by the alert, which comes into effect at 6pm tomorrow and is due to last until 12pm on Friday - with the communities being warned of possible collapsing buildings, road closures, loss of power and extensive flooding. It is the first time a red warning has been issued for rain since Storm Dennis pounded the country in 2020. But just what does a red weather warning mean? A red weather warning is the highest possible alert which can be issued by the Met Office. According to their website it means that 'dangerous weather is expected and, if you have not already done so, you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the severe weather. The Met Office adds: 'It is very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. 'You should avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.' Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly said of Storm Babet: 'Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the red warning. '100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts with flooding likely.' Other parts of the country are facing amber and yellow weather warnings in the wake of the storm. The Met Office describes an amber warning as 'an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans. 'This means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property. You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. 'You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact. Yellow weather warnings are issued when the weather is likely to have a more low-level effect. Many are issued when it is likely that the weather will cause some low level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places,' the Met Office says. 'Many people may be able to continue with their daily routine, but there will be some that will be directly impacted and so it is important to assess if you could be affected. As these are used for a range of weather scenarios, the advice is to 'read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning'. While it is the first red warning issued for rain for some time, there have been a number of red warnings given for other extreme weather events in recent years. A red warning was issued for the South-east and east of England, and south Wales in February 2022 in the wake of Storm Eunice, which brought with it winds of up to 122mph, while 2021's Storm Arwen also led to a red weather warning for wind - covering a large section of the east coast from Aberdeen to Newcastle. However, the most recent red warning was for heat - and it marked the first time the Met Office had issued such an alert for high temperatures. That one, issued in July 2022, covered most of central and Southern England, when the hottest part of the UK reached above 40C for the first time ever.",-1

PUEBLO, Colo.-- A BNSF coal train traveling near Pueblo on Sunday, October 15 derailed on a bridge that runs over I-25. The train consisted of 124 loaded coal cars and when the derailment of 30 cars occurred, it caused the bridge over which it was traveling to collapse, which landed on a tractor-trailer, killing the driver. The derailment also caused I-25 to be shut down through, as damaged cars and coal were spread all across the interstate. The initial report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a broken rail was probably the because of the derailment. The broken rail was located east of the rail bridge. At this writing, it is not clear who owns the bridge. BNSF told The Colorado Sun that the state of Colorado owns the bridge, but the Colorado Department of Transportation is checking records from when the bridge was built in the 1950s to determine ownership. The Sun reports that Matt Inzeao, who is the Colorado Department of Transportation's communication director, said We have been working through some conflicting information thus far. We do not have access to the maintenance and inspection activity performed by BNSF for the bridge. Other than the death of the truck driver, no injuries were reported. RTS will provide further details about this accident upon the release of the NTSBs Preliminary Report, which is expected in about a month.",-1

The regulator said Network Rail is failing to prevent potential safety issues and had no risk-assessed plan for two major crowd crush areas. Passengers waiting on the station's concourse often surge forwards when the platform their train is departing from is announced. The ORR made a visit to the station in September after reviewing CCTV footage of three incidents of concern in the summer. In the footage, which showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels and a lack of crowd control, there were reports of minor injuries and the potential for more serious consequences. The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has now issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Read more: Investigation launched into Flying Scotsman crash Avanti West Coast contract renewed despite 'disastrous' 2022 Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services in the mornings and early evenings can be more expensive and less used than off-peak services, which can result in overcrowding for later trains. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said that managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge. He added: Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. 'Hundreds of people were kettled' Euston was the UK's seventh busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits. At 10.40am, on Sunday 15 October, a points failure at Euston station caused all lines to shut. Network Rail said at the time: We are sorry for the disruption to services in and out of London Euston earlier today while our engineers repaired a fault with the signalling system in the area. In January, passengers called on the Southeastern rail operator to do something as reduced timetables led to hundreds of commuters being diverted to London Bridge - the third busiest station in the UK.

Severe rainfall and winds are expected to pelt Britain this week, leading to heavy flooding that could put lives at risk in eastern Scotland, Britain's national weather service warned on Wednesday. Fall is typically wet and windy in Scotland, and earlier this month floodwaters submerged streets, damaged railways and swept away unharvested crops. But the red alert on Wednesday -- the highest rain alert issued by the weather agency, the Met Office -- signaled the possible severity of the incoming Storm Babet, and officials urged residents to brace for dangerous conditions beginning on Thursday. As much as a month's worth of rain is expected to fall between Thursday and Friday in Scotland, according to the forecast, with some areas expecting 250 millimeters, or 9.8 inches, of rain. That is more than fell in Scotland in the entire month of October in 2022 -- about 196 millimeters, or 7.7 inches. Torrential rain could flood homes, cut off power and other essential services, and leave communities isolated for several days, the agency said. The fast-flowing and rising floodwaters, it added, could pose a danger to life. The storm will bring heavy rain to Scotland's southwest on Wednesday before moving to the northeast on Thursday and into the weekend, David Morgan, flood duty manager for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, said in a release. With earlier rain already filling rivers and saturating catchments, Mr. Morgan said, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. Winds of more than 70 miles per hour were also likely on Thursday, the weather agency said, especially near Scottish coastlines, which are vulnerable to landslides. The heavy rain and winds will also hit Northern Ireland and England, which have weather warnings in place. Local authorities and residents in Scotland prepared on Wednesday for the worst as Humza Yousaf, the first minister of Scotland, cautioned of challenging weather ahead. Travel should be avoided unless absolutely essential, he said on social media, adding that the government was collaborating with emergency services to try mitigate disruptions. The brunt of the storm is expected to affect the northeastern Scottish regions of Angus and Aberdeenshire, and local officials have cleared gullies and offered sandbags to residents trying to protect their property from floodwater. Network Rail, which oversees Britain's railway infrastructure, advised people living near railways in Scotland to secure tents, trampolines and garden furniture to prevent them from blowing onto tracks. The weather agency last issued the highest extreme rain alert in 2020 during Storm Dennis, which left at least three people dead and submerged streets in parts of England, Wales and Scotland. The storm was one of the most intense to batter the North Atlantic and raised questions about the country's preparedness for intense flooding. While it is difficult to attribute individual weather events directly to climate change, scientists say that a warming planet leads to worsening extreme rainfall in many storms.",-1

The Russian leader, who was on a visit to China, briefed president Xi Jinping in some detail about Ukraine saying that external factors and common threats served only to strengthen Russia-Chinese cooperation. The Kremlin chief said that Washington's decision to supply the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), whose use Kyiv confirmed, just prolongs the agony for Ukraine. Firstly, this of course causes harm and creates an additional threat. Secondly, we will of course be able to repel these attacks. War is war, Vladimir Putin said, adding, But most importantly, it fundamentally lacks the capacity to change the situation on the line of contact at all ... This is another mistake by the United States. Ukraine had repeatedly asked Washington for ATACMS to help it attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory. A mistake of a larger scale, as yet invisible but still of great importance, is that the United States is becoming more and more personally drawn into this conflict. And let no one say that they have nothing to do with this. We believe they do, Vladimir Putin said, noting that the United States had sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean in response to the explosion of violence between Israel and Hamas. The Russian president said that it was good that the West was starting to talk about the need to solve the Ukraine crisis by peaceful means, though he did not cite examples. Russia has long said it is willing to negotiate, but only if Kyiv accepts new realities- Moscow's occupation of more than a sixth of Ukraine.",-1

It comes after Biden flew to Tel Aviv Wednesday pledging his support for Israel in the wake of the sprawling attack carried out by Hamas terrorists earlier this month. In remarks there after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said Israel was born to be a safe place for the Jewish people in the world.

Earlier this year, RTS reported on a Fractured Rail Identified in Fiery BNSF Minnesota Derailment. In that April report, BNSF analyzed a section of fractured rail following March 2023's fiery derailment that forced evacuations in southwest Minnesota. . . however they have not officially concluded that the broken rail caused the crash. On April 18, the NTSB released a preliminary report on the Minnesota derailment and stated that a train carrying 14 hazardous materials tank cars was traveling north, and at 12:58 a.m. local time, 10 tank cars derailed, hazardous materials were released and contributed to a fire. On Monday, October 16, NTSB Newsroom announced via Twitter that it has opened a docket for its investigation of the March 30, 2023 derailment of a BNSF Railway freight train on the Marshall District in Raymond, Minnesota. The docket contains 11 items, ranging from the preliminary report to tank car derailment damage to a rail equipment accident record and NTSB tank car damage assessment forms. The Tank Car Derailment Damage Factual Report from July 22, 2023 can also be read below: The memo (below) sent from Zach Zagata, IIC to Robert Hall, Director, Office of Railroad, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Investigations outlines what post-accident inspections and evidence found. It states that the evidence obtained indicate that track-train dynamics worsened a rail head surface condition until a complete sectional break out of the rail head occurred underneath the L-TWI8801-29L. The memo goes on in more detail surrounding DOT 117 Tank Car Design and Vulnerability and how preliminary findings show that hazardous material releases occurred from five breached tank cars, and two of these derailed tank cars sustained punctured shells that released ethanol, which ignited and destroyed manway gaskets of the three additional tank cars and led to the further release of hazardous materials and spreading fire. Similarly, issues were also identified in NTSB investigation HMD22LR001 and insuffiency of tank car thermal protection system design and thermal performance regulations and standards for gaskets used in tank car service equipment are being addressed. The NTSB issued 7 new safety recommendations with 2 to the FRA, 3 to PHMSA, and 2 to the AAR. The NTSB concluded that the in-service rail failure (broken rail) that caused this accident was related to a rail head surface condition.

The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately - ATACMS proved themselves, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the US administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Mr Zelensky's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 310km. The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a US Army website says.",-1

The hearing, hosted by the Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee, comes at a critical time in the wake of Hamas' terrorist attack in Israel. President Joe Biden is in the region this week for meetings with Israeli leaders, and Israel is preparing for a potential ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week that the administration is working to get Lew confirmed quickly. Biden nominated him last month. We are going to work with both Democrats and Republicans -- and particularly the leaders on both sides and the chair and ranking member in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- to make that happen as soon as humanly possible and then get him out to the region immediately thereafter, Sullivan said. After the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, the White House began working urgently to kick-start the confirmation process. Congressional recesses and other issues had delayed it. The YOU.S. has not had a Senate-confirmed ambassador to Israel since Thomas Nides left the administration in July. Stephanie Hallett, a career diplomat, has been the top YOU.S. official at the YOU.S. Embassy in the interim. Lew, who is Jewish, has decades of experience in Washington, and he has been active in pro-Israel advocacy circles. He was the White House chief of staff for the last two years of President Barack Obama's first term and then was treasury secretary from 2013 to 2017. His current positions include managing partner at Lindsay Goldberg LLC, visiting professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and co-president of the board of the National Library of Israel USA. Lew, 68, was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Obama and President Bill Clinton. During the Clinton administration, he helped develop the memorandum of understanding on multiyear YOU.S. funding for Israel, and during the Obama administration he worked several times to provide crucial funding for Israel's missile defense systems that are designed to protect residents from attacks, a White House official said recently. At the beginning of his career, Lew was a congressional aide, at one point serving as a senior policy adviser to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last month immediately endorsed Lew after Biden nominated him. It is vital we have a strong American ambassador in Jerusalem. Mr. Lew is precisely the person for the job of ambassador to Israel that we need, Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. Lew is likely to get widespread support from Senate Democrats, but it is unclear how many Republicans he can win over. And while he may not need GOP backing if all 51 members of the Democratic Caucus back him, unanimous bipartisan support would allow for a faster confirmation vote. The Senate could confirm Lew as soon as next week. Even in the face of Republican opposition, Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., hopes Democrats can get cooperation to move quickly on the Senate floor. It is critically important to have a confirmed ambassador, Cardin told NBC News. We are talking about being with Israel, giving them everything they need. Well, we need to have a confirmed ambassador on the ground in Israel to evaluate exactly what they need and be able to get that aid or weapons to Israel. Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel, told reporters he expects there to be some GOP opposition to Lew. I am going to listen with an open mind, Risch said. But I have to tell you, given the things that have happened in the past with him, it is going to be a heavy lift for me. But he is going to have an opportunity Wednesday to persuade people that he is the right guy for the job. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is not a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told NBC News: We should not confirm someone who has been so soft on Iran, repeatedly. ... The Democrats may say it is a way to show our support for Israel. On the contrary, we should show that we have a new approach to Iran by defeating Jack Lew's nomination. During the confirmation hearing, Republicans are expected to focus on an interaction Lew had before the Foreign Relations Committee when he was treasury secretary in 2015, when he said Iran will continue to be denied access to the YOU.S. financial and commercial market. In 2016, the Treasury Department issued a license granting Iran access to YOU.S. financial systems, but American banks eventually declined, fearing legal and compliance risks. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., another Foreign Relations Committee member, said in an interview on Fox Business Network that he has real concerns that Lew has misled and lied to Congress in the past in terms of the some of the financial arrangements that were made under the Obama administration. Rubio, however, said he thinks the YOU.S. should have an ambassador in every country, and he stopped short of expressing opposition to Lew's nomination. Lew has faced opposition from other Senate Republicans. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, said on X last week that Lew was the key point man in negotiations  disinfo campaign for Obama's dangerously flawed deal w Iran. The consequences are felt today as Iran -- flush w cash due to Biden's push to revive the deal at any cost -- has fueled carnage in Israel, he tweeted. Lew must answer for the failed Obama-Biden Middle East strategy as he appears before the Senate Foreign Relations committee for his confirmation hearing. In 2015, the YOU.S. and other countries entered a nuclear deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which eased sanctions on Iran in return for strict limits on its nuclear program designed to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions while introducing new ones. Republicans criticized Lew in 2016 when, as part of a settlement between the YOU.S. and Iran, he defended a 1.7 billion cash payment to Iran's government. Lew is also likely to be asked about the debate over whether to provide Iran access to 6 billion as part of a prisoner swap deal with the YOU.S. last month. Days after Hamas' attack in Israel, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House Democrats that the YOU.S. and Qatar had agreed to block Iran from accessing the funds, according to three sources familiar with his remarks.",-1

But who would govern Gaza after that?,"Biden administration officials and lawmakers support Israel's plans to strike hard at Hamas but they worry their ally has no clear plan for who will govern Gaza if and when the militants are driven out, according to sources familiar with the matter, members of Congress and former YOU.S. officials. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, an organization that has been entrenched in Gaza for decades and in power since 2006, but the Israeli government has yet to outline what it envisions for the densely populated enclave after the military operation ends. Israel does not appear to have a plan or strategy for what will follow its military offensive, said Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. That is obviously a big problem, as we learned in both Iraq and Afghanistan, said Moulton, who served in Iraq as a Marine. You have to have a plan for the day after and fundamentally it has to be a political plan, he said. Even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken holds marathon crisis talks this week with Israel and other regional governments to avoid a humanitarian calamity in Gaza, Blinken and other officials are also exploring what will come next for Gaza if Hamas is no longer in charge. Whenever we are coming out of this we need a future for the Palestinians that is viable. One lesson of this whole thing is, that is going to be a necessity, Derek Chollet, counselor to the secretary of state, told NBC News. Chollet said Blinken raised the issue of how Gaza will be governed in talks on Tuesday with Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories. Part of the conversation Blinken is having today with President Abbas is what is the future of Gaza without Hamas and what does that mean for the Palestinian Authority and their role? Chollet said Tuesday. On Capitol Hill, preliminary discussions have begun about Gaza's political future, congressional aides said. The Biden administration has vowed unwavering support for Israel after it suffered a surprise attack from Hamas over its southern border on October 7 that left 1,400 dead, mostly civilians, and an estimated 200 captive. But officials also worry about the effects of a massive Israeli bombardment and an expected ground offensive into Gaza on Palestinian civilians, and how a rising civilian death toll could blow up any international effort to rebuild Gaza without Hamas in control. Asked about what will come next in Gaza if Hamas is rooted out, an Israeli official said: At this point, Israel is focused on establishing a humanitarian zone for civilians in Gaza and on destroying Hamas' military capabilities. Other Israeli officials contacted by NBC News declined to comment on the record or did not respond. Israel remains in a state of shock from the Hamas assault, which shattered the country's sense of security, and is preoccupied with the immediate task of striking at their adversaries, former YOU.S. officials said. There is an imperative for Israel to kill the leadership, to destroy the stockpiles of weapons, munitions, explosives, to destroy as much of the military infrastructure as possible, said John Brennan, the former director of the CIA who served in the Middle East during his career at the agency. But the day after, it is hard to envision. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday that the administration was trying to examine how Gaza would be governed in the future. These are important long-term questions to begin asking and grappling with today. We believe that Israel is grappling with them, we are talking to them about them, Sullivan told CBS' Face the Nation. I am not going to share the details of those private conversations. But what I will say is, right now, the focus of the Israeli operation is on that terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. Biden has said that it would be a big mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again. The president said he believed Hamas should be eliminated entirely but there ... needs to be a path to a Palestinian state, he told CBS' 60 Minutes in an interview that aired on Sunday. Given the deep uncertainty about how the Israeli military offensive against Hamas unfolds and how the region reacts, it is almost impossible to draft a plan for Gaza at the moment, some former officials and experts said. The elements of any plan for Gaza would likely involve a transition period under YOU.N. or international authority; an important role for the Palestinian Authority; removing Hamas' weapons arsenal under the supervision of a third party; strong support from Egypt; elections; major international funding especially from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states for the rebuilding of Gaza; and a new peace process designed to forge a two-state solution, said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former senior State Department official who focused on Middle East policy. Such a scenario would mean the sun, the moon and the stars aligning over a period of months and years, Miller said. Talking about a new political future for Gaza is like talking about a galaxy far, far away given the unpredictable factors at work and the daunting political obstacles, he said. Jason Greenblatt, former White House special envoy to the Middle East in the Trump administration, said that the goal should be that once the terrorists are gone, to rebuild Gaza and once and for all try to implement plans that many well-meaning nations have already tried: rebuild Gaza and make it look like it deserves to look. It is a seaside city, he added. It could be incredible. David Friedman, who was YOU.S. ambassador to Israel during the Trump administration, said the endgame for Gaza would be if representatives of the Arab League were willing to step up and kind of pursue some sort of a trusteeship for Gaza for some finite period of time, in a manner that appeals to the Gazans themselves to form institutions for self-governance. For Palestinians, the immediate threat posed by Israel's air raids on Gaza and its order for more than a million civilians to leave northern Gaza make it impossible to contemplate any future political arrangements, much less consider proposals from governments that they believe have abandoned them, said Yousef Munayyer, senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, a think tank. The first and most urgent step needed now is a ceasefire, followed by diplomacy, Munayyer said. The assumptions behind Israeli military action in Gaza were flawed and merely repeating past failures, he said. After Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the Israelis calculated that the costs of maintaining a physical military presence on the ground were too high. So, we have been through this before, Munayyer said. He said that there is no vision for the day after, because it does not exist. Hamas emerged in a power vacuum in Gaza, and militancy would continue to spread as long as the underlying political issues were left unaddressed, he said. The YOU.S. approach in recent years has been to focus on reconciliation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, an idea launched under the Trump administration, as a way of setting the conditions for an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Munayyer said that has proved to be a grave mistake. What we are seeing today, on the ground, is the price that we are paying for ignoring the urgency of dealing with this issue, he said. And there was a great degree of hubris on the part of American policymakers who thought that that was OK. That the YOU.S. could go on with our objectives in the Middle East and elsewhere around the world, without really paying attention to this issue. Despite the current crisis, the Biden administration remains committed to salvaging negotiations for a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an idea that Hamas and its Iranian patrons strongly oppose. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he has spoken at length to Secretary of State Blinken about what could come next for Gaza. We talked about that a lot, said the senator, who was part of a congressional delegation due to visit the region. The Israelis believe that destroying Hamas makes a deal with the Palestinians and peace more likely, not less likely, Graham said in an interview. You have a radicalized population and you have to deal with that. But the conditions for change become better when Hamas goes away, he said. And I do believe that Israel understands there is no normalization with Saudi Arabia without something significant for the Palestinians. Graham said there would need to be a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs the West Bank but was pushed out of Gaza by Hamas, but it would have to be reformed. The PA is the only game in town. But they need to be reformed. Giving a bunch of money to the same old people is probably a waste. It is time for a new generation of Palestinian leadership, he said. But he added that that scenario is a work in progress and it depends on how these military operations end. Since withdrawing from Gaza in 2005, Israel has launched several military operations in the enclave against Hamas, mostly recently in 2021. But Israel will have to re-examine its past assumptions to break the cycle of conflict, said Gershon Baskin, the Middle East director for International Communities Organization, a YOU.K.-based group dedicated to protecting human rights and building peace. If there is a chance of a new tomorrow, with a Gaza that might be able to live in peace with Israel, it has to be a Gaza which is open and developed, where people have work and a chance at a better life, and a future. And it has to be based on the ground rules that Israel can no longer occupy the Palestinian people and expect to live in peace, said Baskin, who helped negotiate the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011 after he was held by Hamas for five years. We have been living with a conceptual delusion that we can have it all and have peace. We cannot lock 2.5 million people in a cage in Gaza and expect for them not to rebel against us.",-1

What a disappoint sic and failure he is, an anonymous sender said in a text that Bacon shared with NBC News. Bacon's wife pushed back, writing: He has more courage than you. You will not put your name to your statements. Another text by an anonymous sender said, Why is your husband causing chaos by not supporting Jim Jordan? I thought he was a team player. Bacon's wife replied: Who is this??? In a separate text message, another anonymous sender wrote: Talk to your husband tell him to step up and be a leader and help the Republican Party get a speaker there is too much going on in the world for all this going on in the Republican Party you guys take five steps forward and then turn around take 20 steps backwards no wonder our party always ends up getting screwed over. Jordan has distanced himself from some of the hardball tactics of his allies and supporters -- some of whom have engaged in a very public pressure campaign online and in conservative media against his political opponents. That pressure campaign is clearly not having the desired effect, with Jordan losing 20 Republican votes on Tuesday and poised to potentially lose still more in a second ballot today. Jordan is headed for defeat. He will fight to death likely, and we will not let off. Their tactics angered us. They are harassing our spouses even.

Exploiting the Palestinian issue has long been a strategic ploy of the Iranian regime. Over the years, Iran's approach has consistently been to sow division and spread Islamic fundamentalism among the Palestinian people, effectively undermining the mainstream Palestinian leadership that is committed to peace and a two-state solution. Hamas was founded in Gaza in 1987. It was an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose candidate Mohamed Morsi won the June 2012 Egyptian presidential elections, but was overthrown within a year after mass protests. Morsi and most of the Brotherhood's leadership were imprisoned in Egypt and the organization was designated as a terrorist group and its assets were seized. Inspired by the Brotherhood, Hamas published a charter in 1988 defining itself as an Islamic national liberation and resistance movement with a policy of establishing an Islamic State in Palestine. Hamas differs from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in that it rejects negotiations with Israel and advocates armed resistance. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2006, defeating its rival Fatah in elections, and has maintained this position ever since. The relationship between Iran and Hamas began in the early 1990s, a few years after Hamas was founded. Iran sees support for Hamas as a means of challenging Israel and extending its influence in the region. Over time, Iran has provided significant financial support to Hamas, particularly after it took power in Gaza in 2006. Iran's aid enabled Hamas to develop its own weapons, with Khaled Mashal, the former head of its political bureau, describing Hamas as the spiritual son of (Ayatollah) Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.When Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006, the Iranian regime increased its support, providing funding, rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles, as well as training and technical assistance through its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) elite Quds Force, responsible for foreign operations. Iran's support for Hamas has continued to strengthen, particularly in the period from 2015 to 2018, which was characterized by the growing threat from Israel and Hamas's increased reliance on Iranian sponsorship. The potency of the relationship was further evidenced by Iran's increased presence in Gaza through proxies such as Islamic Jihad. Some of the fighters involved in the recent terrorist assault on Israel led by Hamas militants belonged to Islamic Jihad, the second-most powerful Palestinian militant group operating in the Gaza Strip with backing from Iran. Like Hamas, Islamic Jihad is also designated as a terrorist group, blacklisted by the UK, EU and US. The closeness of the relationship was amplified in August 2021, when the Hamas leader - Ismail Haniyeh and his team, were invited to attend the inauguration of President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran. Raisi, dubbed 'The Butcher of Tehran' for his notorious role as an executioner during the 1988 massacre of more than 30,000 political prisoners, ensured that the Hamas delegation was met at the airport and seated in the front row during the ceremony. During a series of high-level meetings following the inauguration, Hamas confirmed its unwavering support for the 'axis of resistance' against Israel and for the Iranian regime's proxy wars in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Since then, there has been an increasing flow of rockets, anti-tank missiles and other sophisticated weaponry, smuggled into Gaza through tunnels from Egypt, some of which are large enough to be fitted with rail tracks, and from ships docking in Gaza's ports. Iran has also provided huge financial support to Hamas, both directly and indirectly. Direct funding includes cash payments to Hamas' operatives and officials, as well as specific operations. Indirect funding includes the provision of goods and services, such as medical supplies and construction materials, which Hamas can sell or trade for income. The funding has increased to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Last year, the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, told Al-Jazeera TV that Iran had funded its deterrent forces against Israel and had helped to build attack tunnels to be used to surprise the Israelis. But it must be remembered that the Iranian people do not support the regime's massive spending on proxy wars and militias like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, across the Middle East. With a collapsing economy and widespread poverty, the recent nationwide uprising in Iran has been marked by protesters chanting slogans decrying financial aid to groups like Hamas, highlighting the deep gulf between the mullahs' regime and the public it is supposed to serve. Hamas militants share a philosophy of hatred. They are misogynists. They hate the Jews. They hate Christians. They hate atheists. They hate alcohol, music and Western freedoms. These pet hates manifested themselves in a frenzy of brutality and murder, when they attacked young party goers attending the Supernova music festival at the Re'i am Kibbutz, just three miles from the border with Gaza. The all-night, alcohol-fueled party would have represented the embodiment of all of the militants' warped prejudices, unleashing a bloodbath of mass slaughter and butchery. As the crisis unfolds and retaliation by the Israeli military escalates, killing hundreds of Palestinian militants and civilians, there is only one winner likely to emerge from the conflict....Iran. Already Saudi Arabia, a signatory to the Abraham Accords that sought rapprochement with Israel, has put the plans to normalize relations with Tel Aviv on ice. This will be seen as a great victory in Tehran. Pulverising Gaza will only create a new generation of Hamas terrorists. As Naftali Bennett, the former prime minister of Israel once said, there is no use in struggling against the tentacles of the Iranian regime that encircle Israel. Better to strike at the head of the octopus in Tehran. Seventy five million Iranians want rid of the mullahs' regime. We should support them.",-1

That would never be the way that we would operate. Both CEOs were questioned by MPs at a special session of the committee about the bank holiday Monday systems failure. The main and back-up computer systems that normally assist air-traffic controllers failed around 8.30am on the morning of 28 August 2023. The because was later found to be a rogue flight plan for a French aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Paris, which contained duplicate waypoints. Nats engineers solved the previously unknown problem about eight hours later. For much of that time, air-traffic controllers were obliged to revert to manual handling - reducing the capacity of UK airspace by 85 per cent. The failures led to more than 2,000 flight cancellations, affecting over 300,000 passengers. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, condemned the delay between the initial failure and when carriers were alerted shortly after 11am. He said that with more notice, airlines could have put emergency procedures in place much earlier. There was a three-hour window wasted, he said. Mr O'Leary described the Nats boss as vastly overpaid and incompetent and said Mr Rolfe should resign or be sacked after the incident. Like most airlines we did not find out from Nats, we found out from Eurocontrol shortly after 11am, he said. The numpties at Nats did not tell us. We had to find out from someone else that they would crashed their system. Nats said the standard procedure was for Eurocontrol, which oversees air-traffic control across Europe, to communicate with airlines. Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer of easyJet, said: The first time we heard from Nats was a letter the following day. In total, her airline had cancelled around 600 flights. That is thought to have affected more than 100,000 passengers. She said 30,000 passengers had been re-routed by another carrier or on other forms of transport. Eurostar laid on extra trains between Paris and London in the days following the air-traffic control shutdown to help UK-bound passengers, with airlines footing the bill for rail tickets. Both Ryanair and easyJet are thought to have incurred around 15m each in costs for hotels, meals and re-routing passengers. Jonathan Hinkles, chief executive of Loganair, said airlines were insurers of last resort because of the current regime of passengers' rights. If you buy a new washing machine, you have the choice to buy extended warranty, he said. If you are insuring a car, you can choose between fully comprehensive. Every single air ticket that is sold comes with an extended warranty and fully comprehensive insurance. Martin Rolfe, chief executive of Nats, was questioned immediately afterwards by MPs. He told the committee: I absolutely understand the frustration of the airlines. The shutdown was triggered, he said, despite development work trying to predict as many obscure circumstances as you can. Within 20 seconds of the main system shutting down, the back-up did the same. The back-up system had taken over on four occasions over the last five years without an issue, Mr Rolfe said. He added: In the event of something happening that is inexplicable, it is handed on to humans. We have put in a number of fixes to ensure it cannot happen again. While charges at Nats had increased due to dwindling traffic during Covid, Alistair Borthwick - chief financial officer at Nats - said that since 2002 costs have reduced by 38 per cent in real terms. Nats is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The authority's chief executive, Rob Bishton, described the Nats system failure as a rare and very improbable event that had had huge impacts with people who were travelling. He said Nats had been fined 420,000 in 2016 and 240,000 in 2018 for shortcomings in the service provided, but said the effect of penalties could be to push up air-traffic control charges for airlines, and ultimately passengers. Mr Bishton also complimented both sides in the row. He said: The airlines' response during the incident was in many cases above and beyond what we would expect as a regulator. Later, he added: I believe Nats has been very open and transparent.",-1

Their appearance together came as President Joe Biden arrived in Tel Aviv in a show of support for Israel following a devastating and coordinated terrorist attack by Hamas militants on kibbutzim, music festivals and city streets on October 7, and ahead of an expected Israeli ground assault in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave that Hamas controls. Biden said he was outraged by the blast at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday that is estimated to have killed hundreds of people and for which Israel and Hamas have blamed each other. The blast has set off protests across the Middle East and threatens to derail diplomatic efforts by the YOU.S. and others to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which as of Wednesday had killed more than 3,400 people in Gaza and 1,400 people in Israel. Putin called the hospital blast a terrible event and a disaster. I really hope that this will be a signal that this conflict should be ended as quickly as possible, he said at a news conference. In any case, it is necessary to work towards a possibility of starting some contacts and negotiations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Beijing was shocked by and strongly condemns the hospital explosion, expressing condolences to the victims and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians. Putin also said he was optimistic about the future of the China-Russia relationship and that conflicts like his war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war only made it stronger. All these external factors are common threats, and they strengthen Russian-Chinese cooperation, he said. Representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries, including heads of state, gathered at the imposing Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square for a two-day forum marking the 10th anniversary of Xi's signature Belt and Road initiative. Under the program, China has financed major infrastructure projects around the world in an effort to strengthen relations with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, though in some cases they have been criticized as saddling low-income countries with excessive debt. In a speech at the opening ceremony on Wednesday, Xi said the Belt and Road initiative had established a new framework for international cooperation. He also warned against efforts by the YOU.S. and other countries to reduce their dependence on China, the world's second-largest economy, by decoupling. Beijing has objected to measures it sees as aimed at containing its rise such as YOU.S. export controls on semiconductor chips, which the Commerce Department said on Tuesday it was expanding for national security reasons. Viewing others' development as a threat or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one's own life better or speed up one's development, Xi said, as Putin looked on from the front row. Speaking after Xi, Putin praised the Belt and Road initiative as truly a global plan that is aimed at creating more equitable, multipolar world relations. Most Western European countries and other YOU.S. allies kept their representation at the Belt and Road forum to a minimum, including Italy, which looks set to formally withdraw from the initiative. The Italian ambassador to China was one of several European officials who walked out while Putin was speaking in protest of the Ukraine war. China's ties with the West have been strained by its economic and political support for Russia in that war, which Beijing refrains from calling an invasion. During a meeting with Putin on Wednesday that lasted about three hours, Xi said that China supports Russia in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, according to a readout published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry that did not mention Ukraine. The war between Israel and Hamas has only deepened Western disagreement with China and Russia, both of which have avoided condemning Hamas and say the fundamental solution to the conflict is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. In remarks before their meeting on Wednesday, Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of their countries' strong relationship. Both countries have deepened our mutual political trust and maintained strategic coordination in a close and effective manner, Xi said, noting that trade between the two countries reached a record 190 billion last year. In the current difficult conditions, close foreign policy coordination is especially necessary, Putin told Xi. The two longtime leaders, who declared a no limits partnership between their countries last year at a meeting in Beijing weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have met more than 40 times in the last 10 years and frequently mention their friendship. Putin's trip to China is his first outside the former Soviet Union since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him in March that accused him of illegally sending children to Russia from Ukraine. Vietnamese state media reported Tuesday that during the forum Putin also accepted an invitation from Vietnam's president to visit Hanoi soon. While in Beijing, Putin also met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the only European Union government leader to attend the forum, in one of the few meetings Putin has had with any European leader since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year.",-1

While yellow and amber warnings are more common, it is very rare that we see a red alert in the UK. What do yellow and amber Met Office weather warnings mean? Yellow weather warnings: These weather warnings are issued for a range of weather situations that are likely to cause some low-level impact (such as travel disruption) to a limited area. Such weather warnings mean most people can continue with their day as normal. Other yellow warnings are issued when extreme weather is capable of causing an impact on most but where the certainty of this is much lower. Amber weather warnings: Moving up in severity is the amber warning which is used when severe weather has the potential to disrupt plans. This means the weather could hinder travel, because road and rail closures, and power cuts and pose a risk to life and property. When these are issued, residents should change or alter their plans to protect themselves. When these are released by the organisation, it is advised that residents affected take action to keep themselves and others safe as there is a risk to life. There is also likely to be substantial disruption to travel and infrastructure.",-1

The lead defense lawyer for convicted Fugees hip hop star Prakazrel Pras Michel improperly relied on an experimental generative AI program to draft his closing argument in Michel's high-profile criminal trial last spring, according to a newly-filed brief demanding a retrial for Michel. Michel's new counsel from ArentFox Schiff said that the AI-generated closing argument by Michel's previous lawyer, David Kenner, was a resounding flop: Kenner's closing argument made frivolous arguments, misapprehended the required elements, conflated the schemes and ignored critical weaknesses in the government's case, the brief said. By using an experimental AI program to generate his closing argument, the brief said, Kenner botched the single most important portion of Michel's jury trial. Kenner did not immediately respond to two email queries on the new brief. His co-counsel Alon Israely did not immediately respond to a query sent via LinkedIn. Michel was convicted in April on federal charges of conspiring with fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low in three alleged lobbying schemes to influence two different YOU.S. presidential administrations. His new lawyers contend Kenner's defense of Michel was woefully inadequate, in part because he relied on the AI program EyeLevel.AI to craft his final argument in the complex, politically charged case, which featured testimony from Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio and former YOU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The AI program failed Kenner, and Kenner failed Michel, the brief said. The closing argument was deficient, unhelpful and a missed opportunity that prejudiced the defense. What is even more egregious, according to the ArentFox brief, is that Kenner and Israely appear to have had an undisclosed financial interest in a company called CaseFile Connect, which acted as a technology partner to EyeLevel.AI. The brief asserts that Kenner and Israely regarded Michel's trial as an opportunity to tout CaseFile Connect, advancing their own financial interests at Michel's expense. CaseFile Connect did not immediately respond to queries sent through its website. In a declaration accompanying the brief, ArentFox partner Peter Zeidenberg, a former Justice Department political corruption prosecutor, said his team first learned that Kenner had used an AI program to write his closing argument from Michel's former publicist, who told ArentFox that Kenner said as much at the end of Michel's trial. ArentFox subsequently found a little-noticed May 10 press release issued by EyeLevel.AI after Michel's trial, hailing the first use of generative AI in a federal trial. The press release included a quote from Kenner, who said that the AI program turned hours or days of legal work into seconds, and called his use of the program a look into the future of how cases will be conducted. Zeidenberg's declaration also cited a LinkedIn post by an EyeLevel.AI executive who confirmed the program's use at Michel's trial. AI startup I have been working on is now the first use of AI in a federal criminal trial, the executive wrote in the post. Defense lawyers for Fugees star Pras Michel used our platform to rapidly research and help draft closing arguments. EyeLevel.AI said in an emailed statement that Kenner and Israely do not have a financial stake in its program. EyeLevel's AI for legal is a powerful tool for human lawyers to make human decisions, but do so faster and with far greater information at their fingertips, the company said in response to ArentFox's criticism of its closing argument. EyeLevel is able to ingest and understand complex legal transcripts based solely on the facts of the case as presented in court. ArentFox said it had determined that CaseFile Connect and Kenner's law firm both listed the same office suite in Encino, California, as their primary address. CaseFile Connect's alternative address, according to Zeidenberg's declaration, was a New York City office associated with Kenner co-counsel Israely. CaseFile's website did not disclose its owners, ArentFox said, but the overlap in addresses, Zeidenberg said in his declaration, appears to confirm that Mr. Kenner and Mr. Israely had a financial interest in the AI program Mr. Kenner used to write the closing argument and then boasted about after trial. The ArentFox lawyer said in the filing that his team had contacted Kenner and Israely through their counsel but they declined to speak with Michel's new lawyers about the trial. The motion seeking a retrial for Michel also argued that the proceeding was tainted because the trial judge, YOU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Washington, D.C., allowed jurors to hear that she and another federal judge had already concluded, in the context of the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege, that Michel conspired with an alleged co-conspirator to commit some of the crimes the government charged. Those references, along with allegedly improper testimony about Michel's guilt from the lead case agent on his case, turned the jury into a rubber stamp, the brief argued. The brief listed a litany of purported failures by Kenner, in addition to the alleged AI closing argument fiasco. Among the most serious is ArentFox's accusation that Kenner, who is not an expert in complex white-collar cases or lobbying regulations, outsourced trial preparation to inexperienced contract attorneys at an e-discovery company co-founded by Israely, an old friend. That inadequate preparation was fatal to Kenner's attempts to cross-examine government witnesses, the brief said.",-1

Mark Drakeford told MPs belonging to the Welsh Affairs Committee that the petition will be responded to in the usual way that Senedd petitions are considered. But he said that would not happen until at least next March, because the organiser of the petition has not agreed to close the petition early. That means it will remain open for the full six month period. The First Minister was asked by the committee chair, the Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, if he recognised concerns about 20mph zones that he said had been expressed by some of the emergency services. In response, Mark Drakeford said that There are some individual voices in some services that have expressed concern. The services themselves have not and of course we work very closely with them. The rules are no different in a 20 mile an hour road than they are in a 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 mile road. Emergency services are able to travel above the speed limit where there is a case for them to do so. None of that has changed. And I think a number of these concerns are concerns in advance of the facts, when it comes to operating the system on the ground, I do not think that those fears will materialise. Mark Drakeford also told MPs that he does not believe a single penny will be spent on electrifying the main railway line across the north of Wales by the UK Government. In his recent speech to the Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister announced that the northern part of the HS2 rail project would be cancelled and the money saved would be spent on other projects. That included a pledge to spend 1bn on electrification of the North Wales main line. The First Minister was asked by Conservative MP Robin Millar why the Welsh Government had responded to that announcement by saying that electrification was not a priority for Wales. Mark Drakeford said: First of all, the so-called promise unravelled very quickly indeed, when the Secretary of State for Transport in the UK Government said that this was merely an illustrative list, but nobody was to take it as meaning that this was actual money for actual activity. So you know, I do not think a single penny will be spent on this scheme during the lifetime of the current government. As for the issue about whether or not it is a priority the First Minister said that what our Minister pointed to was the joint committee, a committee made up of representatives of the Welsh Government and the UK Government prioritising plans for rail investment in north Wales, but that committee with UK representatives on it had not put electrification of the main line at the top of the list for investment. The announcement was made with no reference to the group that had been established between two governments to draw up priority plans. I am afraid there is very little confidence amongst people in North Wales that this will ever happen because they saw the experience in South Wales which was promised twice that there will be electrification of the mainline and twice that ban was reversed.",-1

Iran is calling for an oil embargo on Israel over the latest deadly air strikes on the Gaza Strip amid growing tensions in the Middle East just as YOU.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Israel. Iran wants an immediate and complete embargo on the Zionist regime by Islamic countries, an oil embargo against the regime, according to a statement from the foreign ministry on Telegram quoted by Bloomberg. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has also called for Muslim countries to expel their respective Israeli ambassadors if they have diplomatic relations with Israel. Amirabdollahian warned, If the war crimes do not stop and the ongoing genocide by the apartheid Zionist regime in Gaza continues, the situation in the region will spiral out of control. Amirabdollahian met with his Kuwaiti counterpart on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)'s Executive Committee in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The emergency meeting is taking place hours after a missile strike on a hospital in Gaza killed about 500 people, with Israel's army and Hamas blaming each other for the attack, which sent oil prices jumping by more than 2 early on Wednesday. Meanwhile, YOU.S. President Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday to discuss the conflict. Following the bombing of the hospital, a meeting of Arab leaders and Biden in Jordan was canceled. Biden claimed that, from what he has seen, the explosion at the hospital was not carried out by Israel but by the other team. Israel is a small oil importer, but the further escalation of the Hamas-Israel war into the wider Middle East is not being ruled out, and analysts are increasingly concerned about supply from the world's most important oil-exporting region. With Saudi Arabia also taking a pro-Palestine stance in its recent conversations with the YOU.S., the possibility for a quick end of the fighting is fading away while the possibility of greater regional involvement appears to be rising if oil prices are any indication.",-1

He told a news conference during a visit to China that he had briefed President Xi Jinping in some detail about Ukraine. He said external factors and common threats served only to strengthen Russia-Chinese cooperation. The Kremlin chief said Washington's decision to supply the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), whose use Kyiv confirmed on Tuesday, just prolongs the agony for Ukraine. Firstly, this of course causes harm and creates an additional threat. Secondly, we will of course be able to repel these attacks. War is war, Putin said. But most importantly, it fundamentally lacks the capacity to change the situation on the line of contact at all ... This is another mistake by the United States. Ukraine had repeatedly asked Washington for ATACMS to help it attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory. A mistake of a larger scale, as yet invisible but still of great importance, is that the United States is becoming more and more personally drawn into this conflict. And let no one say that they have nothing to do with this. We believe they do, Putin said. He noted that the United States had sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean in response to the explosion of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, and said he had ordered Russian planes with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to patrol over the Black Sea. Putin said it was good that the West was starting to talk about the need to solve the Ukraine crisis by peaceful means, though he did not cite examples. Russia has long said it is willing to negotiate, but only if Kyiv accepts new realities, meaning Moscow's occupation of more than a sixth of Ukraine. Kyiv insists on a full withdrawal of Russian forces, including from the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. (Writing by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",-1

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. Train services in the Highlands will be cancelled tomorrow and Friday as severe weather is expected to affect several north lines. Network Rail said that the Far North Line between Inverness and WickThurso and the Aberdeen to Elgin line will be closed after the Met Office issued a rare red weather warning earlier today. Storm Babet is expected to bring torrential rain in Angus and Aberdeenshire and wind gusts of up to 70mph to parts of the north, with an amber warning issued for parts of the Highlands. The line between Perth and Aviemore will also remain closed and speed restrictions will be introduced on lines in central and eastern Scotland. READ: Scottish Government 'forgets' the Highlands in Storm Babet traffic advice web page Highland Council roads team 'put on stand-by' ahead of Storm Babet WATCH: Storm Babet warning upgraded to amber by Met Office Liam Sumpter, Network Rail Scotland route director, said: Our top priority is the safety of our passengers and colleagues, so we will close lines in the worst affected areas and introduce speed restrictions in others as a precaution. Our engineers will thoroughly inspect the network for any damage before we reopen the lines and restart train services. Weather specialists, based in our control room, will monitor conditions closely throughout Thursday and Friday, and our teams on the ground will be ready to deal with any issues Storm Babet may cause. Earlier today, the Met Office upgraded a yellow weather warning for rain and wind across the country to an amber and a rare red due to the torrential rain that is forecast across Angus and south Aberdeenshire from Thursday until Friday afternoon. This follows major disruption caused by torrential rain earlier this month. Those in areas impacted by the red warning are being strongly advised not to travel. Amber warnings for high winds have also been issued, with very strong winds expected on the east coast and far north of Scotland, which could uproot trees and blow them onto the tracks, damaging railway infrastructure. Engineers will inspect the affected lines on Saturday morning for any damage, and will reopen them as soon as it is safe to do so. Scotland's Railway will use a combination of locomotives, foot patrols and helicopter inspections to do this. A revised timetable will be in place across central and eastern areas of Scotland's Railway on Thursday and Friday due to the extended journey times that the speed restrictions will bring. These changes are being put in place as a precaution against potential flood damage to the railway as heavy rain can cause landslips onto the tracks or wash the stone ballast away from beneath the rails. Extra engineers are being deployed across Scotland's Railway to inspect lines, repair damage, and reopen routes as quickly as possible for passengers and freight customers once the weather clears on Saturday. The following routes will be closed on Thursday and Friday: Passengers are advised to check their journey before travelling at National Rail Enquiries or with their train operator.",-1

The commercial services on India's first RRTS will start on the stretch from Saturday. On Wednesday, News18 travelled on the section from Sahibabad. There were four stops - Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, and Duhai Depot. Without stopping at any of these stations, the fully-air conditioned train completed the 17-kilometre trip in around five minutes. The commercial journey though will take 12 minutes. By road, the minimum travel time is around 30-35 minutes. The train will be running at a speed of 160 kmph. While until the platform the RRTS seems like a metro service, the moment one enters the train, it gives the feel of Vande Bharat service, but without the facility of rotating seats and toilets in the train. Unlike metros, and similar to the Vande Bharat, there are two classes in the six-coach trains - five standard coaches and a premium coach. Entry to the premium coach will be accessible only through a premium lounge situated in one corner made at the platform level across the section. So those travelling in the premium class have to go through two entry points - one at the entrance of the station where the ticket will be scanned and one at the platform. Those travelling in metros are well aware of the metal seats. Here, the RRTS is different. Across the classes, RRTS offers comfortable cushioned seats. The main entry to the station and concourse are exactly like the metro service with automated fare collection gates. There are 10 train sets with the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) that will be operational on the stretch. Across the train, there is a display unit after a certain number of seats, sharing the details of the next station, train speed, and the upcoming stations. At the platform, electronic display units have been installed that will share the details of upcoming trains. The train service will start from 6 am and continue till 11 pm. The minimum fare for the standard class is Rs 20 and the maximum is Rs 50. For the premium class, it is Rs 40 and Rs 100. From the Sahibabad side, the fare for Ghaziabad and Guldhar is Rs 30 for standard class and Rs 60 for premium class. For Duhai, the fare is Rs 40 and Rs 80 depending on the class while for Duhai Depot it is Rs 50 and Rs 100. The system offers a number of ticketing options, ranging from paper QR code-based journey tickets - from Ticket Vending Machines or the Ticket counters at the stations - to the National Common Mobility Card and Digital QR code-based tickets through the NCRTC mobile application, RAPIDX Connect. The RRTS system will allow commuters to use any NCMC card from the first day of operations for travelling. Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis across the train. However, seats have been numbered. At the Sahibabad station, from the concourse, there are two directions for the platform for the up and down trains. At the platform, there are screen doors across the stretch. When the train arrives, these doors will be opened. The twist here is that, unlike the metro, all coach gates will not open automatically. There will be buttons on both sides of the gates - inside and out - from where passengers who want to get down or board the train can operate the gates. It has been done to optimise the temperature. In the standard coach, there are 18 rows - each with four red-coloured seats. There is a dedicated USB point for each passenger for charging electronic items. One coach in every RAPIDX train is reserved for women; it is the carriage next to the premium coach. Also, seats are reserved in the other coaches of the train for women, the specially-abled, and senior citizens. In total, for women, there is a dedicated 72-seat coach and 10 seats are reserved in other coaches. One coach has a dedicated space for wheelchairs. In total, each train has a seating capacity of around 400, but every RAPIDX train with six coaches can carry around 1,700 commuters including those standing. Those boarding these coaches have to go through two-stage automated fare collection gates, one at the entry and another at the platform. This is the first-of-its-kind mechanism in the country. As the name suggests, the coach, having 15 rows each with ergonomically designed 22 transverse seating in blue colour, offers a lot of features for the comfort of passengers starting from reclining seats, coat hooks, magazine holders, and footrests. For each seat, there is a USB and plug point for charging laptops as well. The first carriage moving towards Meerut from Delhi and the last coach moving towards Delhi from Meerut will be the premium coach. The coach also has a wide standing space for those who did not get a seat. Further, there is a vending machine from where snacks or drinks can be bought both inside the coach and at the lounge. Entry to the premium coach will be accessible only through a premium lounge on the platform. In every RAPIDX locomotive, a train attendant will be deputed who will help the commuters with facilities available onboard. Heshe will be stationed in the premium coach and will assist the commuters in need. For ease in last-mile connectivity, e-rickshaws will be standing at the stations facilitating cashless transactions.",-1

The Met Office is responsible for issuing weather warnings, which notify people of the risks and potentail impacts caused by severe weather. They are graded by colour with red the most severe, then amber and then yellow. A red weather warning means dangerous weather is expected and it is very likely there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel and energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. Those in the affected area are warned to avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities. An amber weather warning means there is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, including potential risk to life and property. There is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures and power cuts. A yellow weather warning is issued when it is likely the weather will cause some low-level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places. Some yellow warnings are issued when the weather could bring much more severe impacts to the majority of people but the certainty of those impacts occurring is much lower. This is the first red warning for rain issued in the UK since Storm Dennis in February 2020. A red weather warning was issued in 2022 for extreme heat, covering much of central and southern England, during the July heatwave that year when temperatures soared to 40C. The Met Office has warned of exceptional rainfall expected to cause severe flooding and disruption. This includes the possibility of danger to life from fast-flowing or deep floodwater, extensive flooding to homes and businesses, and collapsed or damaged buildings or structures. The Met Office also cautioned that travel is likely to be affected with road closures, bus and train service delays and cancellations, and dangerous driving conditions because of spray and flooded roads. It said local communities hit by the storm might experience loss of power and other essential services, such as gas, water and mobile phone networks, and could be potentially be completely cut off for several days. Less than two weeks ago, heavy rainfall across Scotland caused major disruption with extensive flooding and landslides. Chief meteorologist Jason Kelly said: Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the red warning. One hundred to 150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts, with flooding likely. He said Storm Babet would track gradually northwards in the coming days, and although the most significant impacts are expected within the red and amber warning areas, there will still be wider impacts for much of the UK from this wind and rain. Amber weather warnings for wind and rain have been issued for parts of eastern Scotland on Thursday and Friday. Yellow weather warnings have been issued across the week from Thursday until Saturday for a large part of the UK, covering parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and northern and eastern England.",-1

Sir John Armitt warned that it would be a mistake to sell the land in a rush after Rishi Sunak betrayed the north by scrapping plans to extend the high speed rail line to Manchester to save cash. Land on the abandoned route north of Birmingham was protected to prevent conflicting developments - but the Department for Transport has now lifted the restrictions. Any property that is no longer required for HS2 will be sold and a programme is being developed to do this, the department said. But Sir John, the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, told the Government it needed a proper consideration about how best we can connect Birmingham and Manchester and give us that improved capacity that we still need. He told the BBC : I think it is a mistake. I think that the land should be kept for at least two or three years to give the opportunity for people to revisit that and look at what can be done within that space and find a more cost-effective solution, not write it off today. I am disappointed because I think it is what we often describe as a sort of knee-jerk, snap reaction. The PM desperately tried to deflect criticism of his decision to axe HS2's northern leg by diverting the 36billion earmarked for the Birmingham to Manchester route to other transport schemes. But his new 'Network North' blueprint included reheated announcements, some completed years earlier and many that are not even in the North. Sir John said a full evaluation was needed to develop it into a well-thought-through, integrated plan for the future. We had an integrated plan a few weeks ago, we have now lost that, he said. There are a number of projects, some of which already existed, some new ones. Let us get those properly turned into a well-thought-through, integrated plan for the future. A Government spokesperson said: Delivering high-quality infrastructure is the foundation of our future growth. Our Network North plan will deliver the transport that matters most to people, and we are adopting a fairer and more pragmatic approach to meeting net zero that supports households and families to make greener choices whilst easing the burdens on working people. We are delivering over 600bn of planned public sector investment in infrastructure, RD and defence over the next five years, including an unprecedented package to improve connections in our city regions and billions to decarbonise buildings.",-1

For us we are just so shocked that out of everybody that went under that bridge, him, she said. Henderson was driving on I-25 in his semi-truck Sunday afternoon. The second he went under the bridge, the BNSF train derailed. I used to call in and check on him when there was an accident, and there is no calling to check on him for this one, she said. Investigators think the broken rail preceded the derailment and the bridge collapse happened after the train derailed. They will continue to investigate why the rail was broken and why warning systems did not alert the crew to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Instead of focusing on why her dad died, James is concentrating on how her dad lived. He is a very dedicated man, and when he is friends with someone he loves them endlessly, she said. I always felt like he was the smartest person in the room. Henderson recently beat cancer, and truck driving became a passion. He started the profession about three years ago. He loved truck driving so much. It was such a joy when he got his license. I remember when he called me - he said boogie. I got my license. I did it. I am going on the road, she said. James said her daughter gave Henderson a stuffed bear to travel with. They called it his safety bear. Of all the cars that drove under that bridge, the timing of this crash feels unfair. I cannot get past just the fact this rate of speed he is going and the time it decided to happen and when it happened, James said. James said her sister had a baby on October 11. James' birthday was on October 13. The crash happened two days later. The family has set up a GoFundMe account to help pay for funeral expenses.

About five months ago, some of the rolling stocks were conveyed to other states of the federation without the knowledge of the security operatives and Borno State Government, the governor disclosed. He said he contacted the NRC on the matter after attempts to remove train coaches were thwarted by vigilant residents. This time around the community raised alarm when they saw the movement of these rolling stocks from Maiduguri to other parts of the country. When we contacted the management of Nigerian Railway Corporation, they said the rolling stocks would be moved to Jos for a complete overhaul and be dispatched elsewhere, he explained. He said the state would no longer allow the removal of infrastructure at the Maiduguri Terminus again without due process. Nobody will move out any of the rail infrastructures here in Borno State without recourse to the rule of law, Zulum vowed. Railway transport to Maiduguri was suspended over a decade ago in the wake of the Boko Haram insurgency. The terminus in Maiduguri was situated adjacent to the initial headquarters of the insurgents before it was demolished by the government in August 2009 after the Boko Haram insurrection.",-1

The 2024 presidential campaign has been all about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war for the last week, putting foreign policy at the center of every candidate speech and event. That was already the case for former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and she has been vocal at every rally that she stands firmly with Israel since Hamas' attack on October 7. We need to be a friend to Israel. We need to be there every step of the way, Haley stated at a town hall in Rochester, New Hampshire, last week. She added, Do not ever be so arrogant to think that we do not need friends. America always needs friends. Having served at the UN for two years during the Trump administration, and her campaign has intentionally leaned into her foreign policy experience since she jumped into the presidential race. Haley often talks about providing weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia and directly confronting China, since she views China as the United States' biggest foreign adversary. But her foreign policy focus on the trail has renewed in the aftermath of Hamas' attack. In America, we always have to have a leader who has moral clarity, Haley said, who can see the difference between good and evil. That has resonated with some voters who have been drawn to her events by her foreign policy experience, with multiple foreign conflicts that affect the YOU.S. raging. Her international experience, two years as the UN Ambassador -- I think that really does help with the situation where we need all the experience we can get right now. We live in very dangerous times, said voter Randy Oliver from Durham, New Hampshire. Tom Boyer, an independent who plans to vote in New Hampshire's Republican primary, stated Haley's position on strong national defense as it pertains to Ukraine and Israel as one of the factors that drew him to her candidacy. Yes, I think her experience in the UN is very important, Boyer said, adding that he hopes other voters jump on the Haley bandwagon. Sharyn Stewart, an undecided New Hampshire voter, has also taken notice of Haley's time at the UN. Other candidates have good experiences in all regions, but she has an international experience. She is dealt with these people in leadership and the General Assembly, Stewart said. It is not just the Israeli-Hamas war that is drawing some voters to Haley's events. Mathilde Diaz, who grew up in Taiwan, stated before a town hall event she was looking to hear the former UN Ambassador's position on China and Taiwan. I would like to know her stand when it comes to China's position -- on the growing ambition of China, Diaz said. That is been a key theme of Haley's campaign, and Haley addressed China moments later during the town all. We need Ukraine to win, and you know who wants Ukraine to win more than anybody else? Haley told the crowd. Who wants us to continue in the West to continue to support Ukraine? The Taiwanese. Why? Because the Taiwanese know if Ukraine wins, China will not go into Taiwan. There is a lot at stake. From Diaz, Haley's response drew a nod of approval -- and a look of relief.",-1

Politicians and community leaders fear many communities will be left stranded and disconnected due to the scaled back timetables and cancellations of these crucial routes. Earlier this month First Cymru confirmed that as a result of reductions in Welsh Government funding, several of its services are being withdrawn, while several others will no longer run as frequently in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire. Among the changed and cancelled services, one service in Neath Port Talbot has been completely withdrawn on weekdays. Neath Port Talbot Council has expressed concern about this, and said it feared further reductions could follow in April, 2024. For residents in Llanelli, the cuts mean that from October 29, the L1, L2 and L3 services have all been cut, the 110 service to Swansea has been withdrawn and the X11 to Swansea is now to run every hour instead of every 30 minutes South Wales West Regional MS Altaf Hussain has reacted to First Cymru cancelling nine services and reducing the frequency of dozens of others throughout the region. He said: I am urging the Welsh Government to rethink its decision to reduce the subsidies for bus services. First Cymru has made it plain that it is these cuts that are the because of decisions to axe or reduce services. Without a subsidy, and with reduced passenger numbers, many services now cost more to operate than the income they receive. I know that Neath Port Talbot Council has lobbied Welsh Government on this and I fully support them. Many people totally rely on buses to get to work, attend health care appointments or for shopping and socialising. Without these services, people will be cut off and isolated. Once a route has ended, it is almost impossible to get it back and people are then forced to use expensive taxis or rely on friends and families. The Welsh Government is doing everything in its power to deter people from using their cars with its 20mph speed limit and to use public transport instead, but they have failed to invest in this. Our train services in Wales, which are run by Welsh Government, are officially classed as the most unreliable in the whole of the UK and now buses are being axed as well. Their transport policy is utterly incoherent and shambolic. Dr Hussain urged the Welsh Labour Government to ensure that the money that will come to Wales as a consequence of the decision to scrap parts of the HS2 rail scheme is used to support bus services as well as fund other improvements. Tom Giffard MS for South Wales West has branded cuts to bus services as reckless. He added: The Welsh Government's decision, which has led to First Cymru deciding to cut bus services in Swansea, shows a blatant disregard for the needs of our community. This move will further isolate residents, many of whom rely on these routes for work, school, medical appointments, and essential shopping. To boost the economy and deliver environmentally friendly public transport, it is vital that the concerns of local residents and businesses are listened to. Llanelli county councillors Michael Cranham and Sean Rees have also raised concern regarding the the L1 service, which goes through their wards of Bigyn and Glanymor, serving the communities of Penyfan, Seaside and Morfa. Cllr Cranham said: Many people in our communities including our elderly, disabled and parents with young children rely on buses to get around. We do fear these cuts to public transport will leave people isolated. We support the ongoing efforts to try and regenerate Llanelli town centre and a crucial aspect of that is accessibility and therefore we feel that these changes are a backward step, as there would be no bus service to and from the town centre in either mid to late afternoon or evening. Councillor Rees said: It is clear many are worried about the impact these cuts will have on their ability to be able to access essential services including hospital and doctors appointments, home to school travel and travel to work. A spokesperson for First Cymru said: It was inevitable that we needed to make changes to our bus network in Cymru when the Welsh government announced the lower levels of support. We recognise the government has had some tough decisions to make as it changes the way it funds bus services. But at the same time, we share the disappointment customers will feel from the knock-on impact that will have on some routes. Following requests from local councils, we have looked at our whole network to see where changes could be made to work within the reduced funding available, and while the majority of services will not be impacted, where we have made changes we have done all we can to save routes, even if this has meant having to reduce frequencies or hours of operation. Regrettably, some services, which are either being served by other routes or have particularly low passenger numbers, will stop operating. We remain committed to getting more people to use the bus, but adequate levels of funding are essential where passenger numbers are below the cost of operating services. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: We have provided the bus industry with more than 200m to support it through the pandemic and beyond. We continue to work with Transport for Wales and local authorities to provide more stable services. Our new bus legislation will set out how we intend to transform the way bus services are planned and delivered in the future.",-1

He told a news conference during a visit to China that he had briefed President Xi Jinping in some detail about Ukraine. He said external factors and common threats served only to strengthen Russia-Chinese cooperation. The Kremlin chief said Washington's decision to supply the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), whose use Kyiv confirmed on Tuesday, just prolongs the agony for Ukraine. Firstly, this of course causes harm and creates an additional threat. Secondly, we will of course be able to repel these attacks. War is war, Putin said. But most importantly, it fundamentally lacks the capacity to change the situation on the line of contact at all ... This is another mistake by the United States. Ukraine had repeatedly asked Washington for ATACMS to help it attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory.A mistake of a larger scale, as yet invisible but still of great importance, is that the United States is becoming more and more personally drawn into this conflict. And let no one say that they have nothing to do with this. We believe they do, Putin said. He noted that the United States had sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean in response to the explosion of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, and said he had ordered Russian planes with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to patrol over the Black Sea. Putin said it was good that the West was starting to talk about the need to solve the Ukraine crisis by peaceful means, though he did not cite examples. Russia has long said it is willing to negotiate, but only if Kyiv accepts new realities, meaning Moscow's occupation of more than a sixth of Ukraine. Kyiv insists on a full withdrawal of Russian forces, including from the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

Deep and rapid emission cuts this decade are critical to avoid cataclysmic climate impacts and keep the 1.5C target of the Paris Agreement attainable. The EU's current targeted level of ambition for 2030 remains insufficient and does not reflect its fair contribution to the fight against the climate crisis. Bring forward the EU's climate neutrality target and commit to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 at the latest, with at least 92 gross emission cuts. In light of the advice of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) and the Paris Agreement's equity principles, the EU as a major historic emitter and industrialised economy bears a higher responsibility than the global average in the fight against the climate emergency. The EU should commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest and set climate targets aligned with the 5-year UNFCCC common timeframes agreed at the Glasgow COP, including for 2035. The Commission should make clear in their proposal for a 2040 target how the EU will close the eventual gap between a fair EU GHG budget that meets its responsibilities and a domestic target that takes into account an ambitious emissions pathway. This gap should be closed through additional mitigation measures in the EU and new and additional financial support to developing countries. This support should not result in funds being diverted from climate change adaptation and loss and damage commitments. Protect, restore and enhance Europe's natural carbon sinks, in particular through dedicated and immediate action to revitalise Europe's forests, wetlands, peatlands and agricultural soils at a much larger scale and pace and ensure net removals are additional to - and not used to offset - urgently needed emissions reductions in other sectors. Making Europe's natural sinks more resilient will not only constitute a key pillar in the EU's fight against the climate crisis, but is also essential in protecting and restoring Europe's biodiversity. Sufficient amounts of financing must result in significantly restoring nature across the EU. Step up adaptation to climate change at EU level. Europe is already facing catastrophic consequences of climate change and needs to prepare for adaptation. A binding European law on planned, ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change, grounded in climate justice, is needed. Implementing agro-ecological practices to reduce water consumption and soil degradation in the agricultural sector, greening cities, eliminating concrete surfaces to combat heat islands, and increasing resources dedicated to fire risk management are all effective long-term adaptation measures, which can help to reduce social inequalities. Ensure the EU leads by example for climate justice internationally. Europe needs to deliver on its obligations to the Global South with special attention to least developed countries and small island developing states. The EU should fully honour commitments to providing new and additional international climate finance for mitigation and adaptation, including the collective doubling of adaptation finance by 2025 (based on 2019 levels) in line with its fair share. Public finance contributions should be the focus, with grants and highly concessional finance for mitigation and grants for adaptation prioritised. The EU should also make multi-year pledges at a scale of billions of USD to the new Loss and Damage Fund, and find new revenues from equitable global, EU and national taxes and levies which make big polluters pay for climate damages.Urgent action is needed on debt and tax justice, through significant reform of the IMF and World Bank, debt cancellation, and a UN Tax Convention, to give countries the fiscal space they need for climate and development action. The EU should endorse an inclusive and feminist climate policy as a cornerstone of EU external action and diplomacy. A just approach to international climate action also means making sure its trade policy is supporting rather than contradicting climate and development objectives with trade, financing and investments built around development objectives rather than extraction of raw materials. End the fossil fuel era once and for all. Adopt binding phase-out dates and trajectories to seal the end of the use of coal (by 2030 at the latest), fossil gas (by 2035 at the latest) and fossil oil (by 2040 at the latest). This also necessitates the phase-out of unsustainable and costly technologies such as nuclear power. Ending the reliance on fossil fuels and uranium, which are largely imported, is essential to strengthen the EU's energy resilience, strategic autonomy and security. Put an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies in a socially just manner and stop fossil infrastructure expansion, including for liquefied gas. End the fossil fuel industry's excessive weight on EU and Member States' decision-making processes and stop giving the fossil gas industry another lifeline through ill-considered and inappropriate support for hydrogen. Support for hydrogen should be targeted at hard to electrify sectors only and be produced from additional renewable energy sources. Ensure the EU endorses and supports an international Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. Build a 100 renewable energy system by 2040 with people and nature at its heart. Speed and scale up the deployment of sustainable renewable energy such as wind and solar, and necessary infrastructure, while avoiding new hydropower plants and sources of bioenergy that increase emissions compared to fossil fuels, and ensure renewables provide a share of at least 50 of the EU's energy mix by 2030. Make sure the energy market is strong, resilient, flexible, and people-centred maximising the uptake of variable renewables, demand-side flexibility and electrification, providing affordable energy for all. Empower consumers (households, energy communities, businesses, and small and medium-sized industry) to be on top of their energy production and consumption and optimise the energy demandsupply, fully tapping into the huge benefits in terms of costs, raw material use and land savings from avoiding new infrastructure. Put in place strong support for flexibility measures such as demand side response and storage to ensure the energy system can deal with increasing supply of variable renewable energy. Since local authorities are a key actor in the deployment of renewable energy, European funding needs to be dedicated to local engineering in local authorities and the structures that support them, especially for more human resources and skills. Fully tap into Europe's energy savings potential and adopt EU-wide and national targets to cut energy consumption in half by 2040. Accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency and sufficiency measures in all sectors of the economy and mobilise investments at national, regional and local level to ensure at least 20 energy savings by 2030. Enable a tripling of the renovation rate and a large-scale roll-out of deep renovation for all occupants, a transport modal shift from inefficient aviation to rail and light efficient vehicles, more electric vehicles and the use of more efficient appliances. It will require building on lessons learned to enable structural change and further drastic changes in current production and consumption patterns, including a focus on sufficiency, repair, circularity, recycling, cutting industrial resource use and primary energy demand. Energy savings are key for making Europe independent from energy imports, while helping the economy, leading to more jobs, reducing energy waste, greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills. Advance the just transformation and make the European Green Deal the engine for new jobs. Support local communities of regions dependent on coal and carbon-intensive industries in decline with funds, tools and know-how so they can become prosperous, climate-neutrality oriented and resilient to socio-economic effects of the change. The process needs to be implemented in a transparent and participatory manner, in cooperation with citizens and stakeholders, with the full involvement of trade unions. The European Commission should issue targets and recommendations for qualification and employment in climate-friendly and circular-economy sectors. The Commission and Member States should draw up projections of the upcoming transformation at the regional level, identify potentials for new value-added and employment clusters and assess existing education and training needs. Education and training should be consistently geared towards climate-friendly employment, for example through retraining from automotive to recharging infrastructure, from the aviation to the rail industry, training programmes for the refurbishment of residential buildings, installation of heat pumps and solar panels or employment in the circular economy. Ensure a sustainable and fair natural resources management within and beyond the EU, effectively tackling over-production and over-consumption. Bring back Europe's resource consumption within planetary boundaries and setting ambitious and binding targets to reduce the EU's material footprint and achieve a fully circular economic model throughout all sectors. Ensure due diligence for social, environmental and human rights impacts in critical mineral supply chains, particularly in the Global South. Enhance social protection and cohesion through a redistributive agenda based on the polluter pays principle. Make sure that the costs and benefits of the transition are borne and shared equitably across society, with a greener fiscal system based on the principle that the polluter pays for the full societal harm caused as well as mechanisms to redistribute the costs of the transition fairly. For the transport sector, this entails taxing environmentally harmful fuels at the highest rate in a socially just manner and fully recycling revenues to further enhance climate action, in particular to make sustainable mobility affordable for low income households and massively invest into accelerated expansion of the European rail network. In the agricultural sector, this requires a complete overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards a system where subsidies are strictly linked to sustainable agricultural practices, accelerating an agroecological transition away from industrial agriculture with reduced industrial livestock farming. Increase social resilience and strengthen the increase of dedicated funds enhancing social cohesion and fighting energy poverty, such as the Social Climate Fund, public goods and services for all through policies that enhance the fair redistribution of wealth and resources, sustainability, protection of biodiversity, gender responsiveness, racial equity and societal wellbeing. Align financial flows with the fight against the climate and biodiversity crises. The EU should exclude any possibility of using EU funds for new fossil fuel investments and infrastructure projects in Europe and internationally which increase fossil fuel use. This includes immediately closing all the loopholes that remain in several large EU funding instruments including the Recovery and Resilience Facility and cohesion policy funds and permanently excluding all fossil fuel finance from 2025 onwards. Reform the EU public debt and deficit rules and establish a new EU fund for climate and just transformation to enable the needed investments in the just and green transition. Revise the EU taxonomy to exclude nuclear and gas from green labelling, and regulate private finance to maximise its support to the green transition. Strengthen, protect, resource and support civil society and youth organisations, independent science and research and media across Europe. Protect and expand civic spaces at EU, national and local levels through effective, transparent and timely public participation in policy-making, implementation and expansion of citizens' assemblies and other innovative forms of civic participation at all levels, and firm action against threats or breaches of the rule of law. Ensure meaningful youth participation in formal policy processes and enable young people to design their own future through supporting youth-led initiatives. Strengthen the role of local authorities, citizens and community-led grassroots initiatives in EU decision-making processes and resource them adequately as they are at the forefront of the action against climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Guarantee current and future generations' fundamental rights to a healthy environment, to enjoy a life with dignity and environmental protection. Strengthen citizens' rights to access to justice and improve compliance with environmental and climate obligations at national, EU and international level. Facilitate litigation to hold accountable governments, business and financial institutions for their ongoing investments in fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries and the related human rights effects that such investments can provoke.

The train derailed at KM 5204 at the crossing between Sentolo and Wates stations in Kulon Progo district of Yogyakarta on Tuesday (October 17, 2023). We are coordinating with the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) to investigate the because of the train's derailment, said Didiek Hartantyo, President Director of KAI, in Kulon Progo. KAI has investigated the driver of Argo Semeru train and the driver of Argo Wilis train, which brushed past it soon after the derailment, resulting in both rail tracks getting blocked and both trains suffering damage. Based on a preliminary investigation, the Argo Wilis train driver had time to brake, but the distance was too close, making the accident unavoidable, Hartantyo informed. We do not want to conclude the because of the incident yet. The condition of the train is also roadworthy, and all procedures have been carried out, he added. However, his party is continuing to investigate the because of the Argo Semeru train's derailment. We will continue to investigate this incident and monitor train activity after the incident, he said. Hartantyo said that 32 passengers on the Argo Semeru train needed treatment, while 28 others experienced shock but were sent home later. He added that four passengers were rushed to the hospital. Three of them were already discharged and the other one remained hospitalized due to a head injury. Erni Basri, Director of Railway Safety at the Directorate General of Railways (DJKA) of the Ministry of Transportation, said that she could not provide more details since the investigation was still going on. All train activities always run according to procedures. Train drivers have also been trained and work according to existing standards, she added.

The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services - such as those in the early morning and late afternoon - are more expensive and less used compared with off-peak services. This can result in overcrowding on off-peak trains at major stations. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said: Managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge, a challenge that our dedicated cross-industry team rise to each day, always putting passengers' wellbeing and safety at the forefront of their minds. Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. The ORR has asked us to look at some other specific areas and our team, along with our train operating colleagues, are already on the case making further improvements. Euston was the UK's fifth busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits.",-1

It comes as Storm Babet is expected to batter the country tonight with most areas of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland being issued weather warnings. Currently, there are a total of eight warnings spanning across the country for rain and wind of different severities. In fact, Greater Manchester has been issued an extensive 36-hour yellow warning for rain which will not expire until early Saturday morning. The warnings mean that there could be increased risks of flooding and damage to buildings depending on the rainfall intensity. Read more: Storm Babet: Rain warning for Greater Manchester as rare red 'danger to life' alert issued for part of UK On the rare red warning issued in Scotland, Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly said: Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the Red warning. 100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts with flooding likely. Here is a breakdown of all the warnings spannign across the UK in anticipation for Storm Babet... Red warning for rain - East Scotland The red warning for rain covers parts of Invebervie, Laurencekirk, Montrose, Brechin, Forfar, and Kirriemuir and will remain in effect from 6pm on Thursday, October 19 to 12pm on Friday, October 20. The Met Office warns that exceptional rainfall is expected to occur, resulting in 'severe' flooding and disruptions. There is also an increased danger to life from fast-flowing or deep floodwater as well as flooding to homes and businesses. This, in turn, can result in a variety of road closures, public transport disruptions, and damage to buildings or structures. It also warns that communities could be cut off, perhaps for several days. Amber warning for wind - East Scotland The amber warning for wind covers Aberdeen, parts of Dundee, Montrose, Peterhead, and Fraserburgh and will remain in effect from 10am to 6pm on Thursday, October 19. Storm Babet is expected to bring a spell of very strong winds to northeast Scotland which will likely result in disruptions. Along the coast, there is an increased danger to life from large waves and beach materials being thrown onto roads, sea fronts, and properties nearby. There is also an increased risk of power being cut off which could affect things such as mobile phone services. Travel disruptions are also expected in the affected areas, resulting in potential road closures and public transport disruptions. The Met Office also warned that: Flying debris is possible and could lead to injuries or danger to life. Amber warning for rain - East Scotland Storm Babet is expected to bring exceptionally wet conditions across parts of Scotland. Currently, the amber warning is in effect from 6am on Thursday, October 19 until 6pm on Friday, October 20 and will cover Dundee, Perth, Aberdeen, and other surrounding towns. The rain is expected to create dangerous driving conditions and an increased chance of flooding to homes and businesses. Road closures are also expected which may result in delays to bus and train services. Yellow warning for wind - North Scotland A yellow warning for wind will cover the northern half of Scotland from 3am on Thursday, October 19 to 12pm on Friday, October 20. Some major areas affected include Inverness, Ullapool, Thurso, Wick, and Stromness. The yellow warning indicates that there is an increased chance of some roads and bridges closing which can create longer journey times and possible cancellations of bus, rail, air, and ferry services. There is also an increased risk of damage to buildings from tiles being blown from roofs. Amber warning for rain - North Scotland Heavy rain is expected to hit a small area of North Scotland, covering Bonar Bridge and parts of Golspie with the warning remaining in effect from 6pm on Thursday, October 19 to 9pm on Friday, October 20. Affected areas are expected to see fast flowing or deep floodwater which could increase danger to life. Yellow warning for rain - Central, North, and East Scotland A wide part of Scotland will be hit by very wet weather, with a yellow warning being in effect from 6am on Thursday, October 19 to 6am on Saturday, October 21. Major areas affected include Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth, Stirling, Dundee, and Aberdeen. All affected areas are at risk of flooding on roads which can make driving more difficult as well as delays to train and bus services. There is also a small chance that homes and businesses could be damaged from flooding as well as a small chance or floodwater cutting of communities. Yellow warning for rain - North West and North East England It is not just Scotland that will be hit by Storm Babet, parts of England will also be affected, including Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, York, Middlesbrough, Scarborough, Newcastle, Leeds, and York. A yellow warning will cover these areas from 6pm on Thursday, October 19 to 6am on Saturday, October 21.

Low pressure areas (LPAs) are linked to the convergence and upward motion of air, forming closed, anti-clockwise wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. And these systems can bring a ton of rainfall across the country when they cross the coasts. Amid the northeast monsoon's impeded arrival due to the southwest monsoon's reluctance to leave, a pair of rain-bearing systems are brewing on either side of South Peninsular India, threatening wet weather to those parts of the sub-continent. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic circulation lying over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea is likely to move west-northwestwards. During this period, it is expected to influence the formation of a low pressure area in the central parts of the Bay by Friday, October 20. In the meantime, another cyclonic circulation that has been stationed over the southeast Arabian Sea since Monday has now given way to the formation of a low pressure area in the region. Weather models indicate that this system will trudge west-northwestwards, developing into a well-marked low pressure area over the next 24 hours and then a depression over the Central Arabian Sea around Saturday, October 21. Its potential strength remains ambiguous for now, but should it further intensify, this system will become the first post-monsoon cyclone in the Arabian Sea this year. It will then be named 'Tej' in accordance with the naming list followed for cyclones in the Indian Ocean region. Accordingly, the IMD has predicted up to moderate showers accompanied by thunderstorms and lighting in Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Wednesday, October 18. Some scattered to fairly widespread rains might permeate South Interior Karnataka as well. Thunderstorm activity is expected to prevail over Kerala until October 19 while light to moderate rains are likely in Tamil Nadu until October 23. Given these predictions, a yellow watch has been issued across Kerala and Tamil Nadu for today so as to urge locals to 'be updated' about the inclement weather. Fisherfolk along the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts have been cautioned against venturing into sea today and tomorrow. Rough sea conditions are likely between October 20 and 22. Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted that the northeast monsoon will arrive in Tamil Nadu between October 23-25, meaning the southern state could witness an almost continuous supply of rains in the coming days.

The country's second named storm of the season, will last until Saturday and is expected to bring more than a month's worth of rain, with the Met Office warning of flooding, power cuts and travel disruption. An amber severe weather warning has been put in place for parts of the UK, with the most severe conditions hitting east Scotland, where a 36 hour warning will remain in place from 6am on Thursday to 6pm on Friday. Parts of Scotland expected to see up to 150-200mm of rain fall.

A fallen tree blocked the railway between Macclesfield and Stafford, causing all lines to be blocked, resulting in CrossCountry trains running through the area being cancelled or diverted. Transport for Wales stepped in to help commuters travelling between Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly, while a shuttle bus service replaced trains for those travelling to the area. Meanwhile in Maida Vale, West London a huge tree came crashing down onto a car, while the driver was trapped inside it. Fire crews raced to the scene and managed to miraculously grab the driver out of the crushed vehicle. Gale force winds are expected along the coast of Wales and South West England, as well as in higher areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. The storm will first bring some heavy rain to Northern Ireland through this afternoon and into Thursday morning. The Met Office said people in the region can expect spray and flooding which may lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures for the duration of the yellow warning for rain, which comes into effect at 2pm and expires at 10am on Thursday. It said 'there is a small chance' that homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings. It also warned of a a small chance of fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and communities being cut off by flooded roads. If flooding occurs, there is a chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wardle said: 'Storm Babet will bring disruption for parts of the UK in the coming days, with heavy rain and strong winds likely for many. 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'As well as heavy rain, Storm Babet will bring some very strong winds and large waves near some eastern coasts too. Gusts around 70mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. Met Office warnings will continue to be reviewed as the forecast develops.' The RNLI warned the strong winds that have been forecast along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. RNLI water safety partner Sam Hughes said: 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' The Met Office said low pressure is forecast to remain in charge of the UK's weather into the start of next week, with potential for further spells of wet and windy weather.",-1

Train expert explains after Colorado derailment,"Meanwhile, Colorado and BNSF debate responsibility for the collapsed bridge DENVER (KDVR) -- Federal investigators have released preliminary information showing a broken rail likely caused the Colorado train derailment near Pueblo on Sunday. That derailment killed a truck driver on Interstate 25 and has led to an indefinite closure of the interstate. The National Transportation Safety Board released its preliminary findings on Tuesday. Train derailment investigator Gary Wolf told FOX31 that broken rails are a common because of derailments. The rails are made of high-quality steel, but occasionally, there can be an imperfection in the rail, Wolf said. These can develop quickly or sometimes they develop slowly, and when they do, they start cracking out the railroad. And eventually, it results in the rail breaking part, and obviously, you lose continuity in the rail surface and the wheels go down and hit the ground. Wolf said railway companies use special equipment to test for broken rails multiple times each year, but he said defects can be tough to find. It is very difficult to find these defects in a rail, he said. It is the proverbial needle in a haystack that you are looking for. When you are going down the track with this ultrasonic test car, you are looking for defects in the millimeter range, and they are tough to find. Who is responsible for maintaining the bridge? Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. According to spokesperson Matt Inzeo, CDOT is aware of the statements BNSF has been making regarding ownership, saying the agency is working through every document we can find that deals with rules, responsibilities and ownership. One reason this is taking time is that we continue to encounter and need to resolve potentially conflicting information. Inzeo added: While there are a handful of exceptions, the state does not own the railroad bridges that cross state roads. For all bridges owned by other entities, they have their own inspection and maintenance responsibilities as part of using that bridge for its given purpose (railroads and utilities are the most common cases of this). And for the few railroad bridges that the state does own, railroads also conduct their own inspections. We do not have records of BNSF's inspections of this bridge.",-1

Israel's army and Hamas blamed each other for the attack. Oil market watchers, meanwhile, began worrying about an increased possibility of oil supply disruption from the region as the prospect of a diplomatic solution became rather remote. The latest indication for this was the cancelation of a summit between YOU.S. President Joe Biden and the presidents of Egypt and Palestine, to be held in Jordan. Jordan canceled the summit on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Jordanian King Abdullah has blamed the tragedy at the Gaza hospital on Israel. With Saudi Arabia also taking a pro-Palestine stance in its recent conversations with the YOU.S., the possibility for a quick end of the fighting is fading away while the possibility of greater regional involvement appears to be rising if oil prices are any indication. A long occupation looms as the scenario that pushes Brent oil futures above US100bbl because it raises the risk that the Israel-Hamas conflict expands and potentially draws in Iran directly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar told Reuters. Clearly a widening of the conflict would bring more supply risks to a market which is already very tight, Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for Dutch ING, told Bloomberg. The most immediate supply risk likely remains around Iranian barrels. Bloomberg recalled Iran had earlier this week warned that the escalation of the conflict regionally was getting inevitable. Meanwhile, the latest GDP data from China provided additional support for prices. The country's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, booking a 4.9 annual increase and a 1.3 quarterly growth rate. Later today, oil watchers' attention will be focused on the EIA weekly oil inventory report after the American Petroleum Institute estimated a solid 4-million-barrel draw when analysts had expected a much more modest one of about half a million barrels.",-1

The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Last month, White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said that YOU.S. intelligence had been tracking the possibility of North Korea supplying Russia with weapons for quite some time. And the reason why...there is such an intense effort on the part of Moscow to generate this kind of support from North Korea is that we have continued to squeeze...Russia's defense industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition, Sullivan said in September. Other researchers have also documented evidence pointing to increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia following Kim's visit to Russia. The level of rail traffic is far greater than what has been observed at the facility during the past five years, even compared to pre-Covid-19 levels, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report released earlier this month. Given that Kim and Putin discussed some military exchanges and cooperation at their recent summit, the dramatic increase in rail traffic likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.

He added that the informal transport service will be carried out normally like other international airports without any change and there was no ban on the transport of passengers in Siem Reap Airport and that Siem Reap Angkor International Airport has decided to transfer the rights of a company to operate transportation services in the airport, which costs  35 per car and  40 per bus or  8 per person. His Excellency continued that the establishment of this service is because Siem Reap Angkor International Airport is a new airport and about 50 km from Siem Reap and there is no public transport to get there, so the airport decided to operate a taxi service. He added that if you look at the transportation cost of the bus,  8 per person for a distance of nearly 50 km compared to other transport services in kilometers, the two transport services are no different As for the cost of transportation, he added that it depends on the choice of the traveler His Excellency further stated that for other transporters outside the system who want to enter the system of Siem Reap Angkor International Airport, they can register with the Transport Association to maintain order and safety for passengers at the airport.

According to the Estonian ministry of economy, the damage site was located about 30 miles off Hiiumaa, an island in the Baltic off the west coast of Estonia. The cable is Swedish-owned, and the operator brought it back into service within a matter of days. The description matches the Sweden-Estonia EE-S1 cable, which terminates on Hiiumaa. The break was only partial, Sweden's Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said Tuesday, and an investigation into the because is under way. We cannot assess what caused the damage. But what we can say is that this damage has happened at a similar time and in physical proximity . . . to the damage that was previously reported to a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland, and a telecommunications cable between Estonia and Finland, he said.

While the culprit has not been identified, Finnish authorities believe that it was an actor with a high degree of technical sophistication. A sabotage of this caliber requires a certain amount of know-how and special equipment. It is probably not ordinary people who were behind this, said Timo Kilpelinen, head of the Finnish NBI's Investigation Department.

The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately - ATACMS proved themselves, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the YOU.S. administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Zelenskiy's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 190 miles (310 km). The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a YOU.S. Army website says. A NEW CHAPTER Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a new chapter of the war had begun. There are no more safe places for Russian troops within the ... internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, he wrote on X. Russian military bloggers commented on the attacks during the day, with Telegram channel Fighterbomber saying Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS. Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS for the first time on Tuesday. Since starting a counteroffensive in June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in Russian-occupied areas, but it has failed to liberate significant territory from Russian occupation. Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern group of forces, told national television that there had been no letup in Russia's week-old assault on the devastated town of Avdiivka in the east, with Ukrainian forces repelling 10 attacks. Shtupun also said Ukrainian forces advancing southward to the Sea of Azov had registered partial success west of Verbove, one of a cluster of villages it is trying to capture. The Ukrainian military said Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter.

The news comes as Biden prepares to depart for visits to Tel Aviv, where he will underline US support for Israel. Meanwhile, Israel continues to ramp up preparations for an anticipated ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in response to the deadly October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas militants, Ukraine continues to fight off a Russian assault which has now been going on for over 600 days, and China continues to threaten Taiwan. US senate leaders had said earlier on Tuesday they expected Biden to send them a request by the end of this week for billions of dollars in assistance for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and for security at the US border. Two of the sources said the request was for a full year of funding, explaining its large size. A congressional source familiar with the request told Reuters that Israel had asked for 10 billion in addition to the 3.8bn per year it received from the United States under a 10-year agreement that began in 2016.

The stark figures speak for themselves. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam has resulted in a staggering loss and damage, said Christophoros Politis, the United Nation Development Programme's deputy resident representative in Ukraine. The preliminary figures put the damage and losses at 13.79 billion, taking into account the environmental toll, the loss of power generation, irrigation for farming and housing as well as other factors. The destruction of the dam is foreseen to have severe, enduring consequences on Ukraine's environment, economy and society, a post-disaster needs assessment report said. The UN added that it does not know the extent of damage to Russian-occupied areas of the Kherson region, where the dam was located. Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, which crosses the Dnipro river, flooding the surrounding area with landmine-contaminated water and leaving areas upstream without water supply.

Kyiv has repeatedly asked the US for ATACMS to help attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory. President Joe Biden approved a future delivery last month and told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House that the US would give Ukraine the ATACMs, without specifying when or how many would be delivered. Because of lingering US concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, for instance by striking targets on Russian soil with NATO weaponry, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range of and carry cluster munitions, which when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets, rather than a single warhead. Kyiv has also put pressure on Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, similar to ATACMS, causing debate amongst German politicians. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had used the risk of escalation to justify his decision not to deliver Taurus cruise missiles with a range of 500 kilometres to the war zone for the time being, despite urgent pleas from Ukraine.

Measures to improve the energy efficiency of the entire grid are also planned, according to a KfW statement. For example, the reconstruction of the grid infrastructure will include the use of reinforced concrete to protect the facilities against further attacks, as well as energy-efficient technologies. Ukraine's power grid has been severely damaged by targeted Russian airstrikes since the start of the war. According to the KfW, by April 30 Ukraine's energy production capacity was less than half what it had been before the war. In addition, 41 out of 94 high-voltage transformers had been damaged or completely destroyed by attacks, according to the report.

In its daily update on the war in Ukraine, the ministry described the offensive as likely the most significant offensive operation undertaken by Russia since at least January 2023. Russia's attack is likely being carried out with multiple armored battalions, which are attempting to envelope the town, the Ministry of Defence statement read. It added that Avdiivka has been on the frontline since 2014. The town is a major obstacle in preventing Russian forces from their wider objective of taking control of Donetsk Oblast. The ministry suggested that Ukrainian forces were so far holding back the Russian advance. It added that Russian forces have sustained heavy equipment and personnel losses. Slow progress and high casualties have likely triggered a change in messaging from Russia, from an offensive to 'active defense,' as successfully clearing Avdiivka looks increasingly unlikely in the short term.

Blast kills hundreds at Gaza hospital; Hamas and Israel trade blame, as Biden heads to Mideast KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Around them in the grass were blankets, school backpacks and other belongings. Outrage over what many believed was an Israeli strike flared across the region, a day before President Joe Biden was due to arrive to show support for Israel and try to prevent the war from spreading. The carnage unfolded as the YOU.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas' deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hamas called Tuesday's hospital blast a horrific massacre, saying it was caused by an Israeli strike. The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often cooperates with Hamas in their shared struggle against Israel. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital at the time and that intelligence from multiple sources indicated it was responsible for the failed rocket launch that hit the hospital. Destruction at Gaza hospital increases stakes for Biden's trip to Israel and Jordan WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's efforts to tamp down tensions in the escalating war between Israel and Hamas faced a bloody setback Tuesday when, shortly before his expected departure for the Middle East, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas withdrew from scheduled meetings to protest an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike but the Israeli military said it had no involvement and pinned the blame on a misfired Palestinian rocket. Abbas' cancellation, disclosed by a senior Palestinian official, reflects an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of American influence in the region as Biden visits Israel and Jordan on Wednesday. Biden's decision to put himself in a conflict zone -- the same year he made a surprise visit to Ukraine -- demonstrates his willingness to take personal and political risks as he becomes heavily invested in another intractable foreign conflict with no clear end game and plenty of opportunity for things to spiral out of control. The high-stakes presidential trip is emblematic of Biden's belief that the United States should not turn back from its central role on the global stage and his faith that personal diplomacy can play a decisive role. War between Israel and Hamas raises fears about rising US hostility A fatal stabbing in Illinois, a gun pointed at protesters in Pennsylvania, vandalism at synagogues and harassment of staff at a Palestinian restaurant all are raising fears that the war between Israel and Hamas is sparking violence in the United States. The tensions follow a familiar pattern of crimes against Jewish and Muslim communities rising when conflict erupts in the Middle East and Americans have been killed or taken hostage. We have a two pronged threat to American faith communities, said Brian Levin, founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernadino. While it is too soon to say with certainty whether anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish crimes have increased during the war, hate crimes overall increased in the YOU.S. last year. In its annual report released Monday, the FBI estimated that hate crimes increased by 7 to 11,634 cases in 2022 compared to the previous year. With 1,124 incidents, anti-Jewish attacks were the second most reported hate crime, after anti-Black cases. There were 158 reported incidents of anti-Muslim attacks, and 92 reports of anti-Arab cases, according to the report. Civil rights organizations, however, believe that even before the Hamas attacks in Israel, crime data did not reflect reality due to a lack of participation by local police departments and internalized fear among the Muslim population, said Robert McCaw, director of governmental affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In 2021, the Othering  Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, released a study in which 85 of those who were subjected to Islamophobia said they did not report it to authorities. Republicans reject Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot, signaling more turmoil ahead WASHINGTON (AP) -- More turmoil ahead, Republicans rejected Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot Tuesday, as an unexpectedly numerous 20 holdouts denied the hard-charging ally of Donald Trump the GOP majority needed to seize the gavel. Additional voting was postponed as the House hit a standstill, stuck while Jordan works to shore up support from Republican colleagues to replace the ousted Kevin McCarthy for the job. Reluctant Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. Next votes were expected Wednesday. We are going to keep working, Jordan said at the Capitol as evening fell. It is been two weeks of angry Republican infighting since McCarthy's sudden removal by hard-liners, who are now within reach of a central seat of YOU.S. power. The vote for House speaker, once a formality in Congress, has devolved into another bitter showdown for the gavel. Jordan said after the first vote that he was not surprised and expected to do better in the next round. But the afternoon dragged on with no further votes Tuesday. Trump returns to his civil fraud trial, hears an employee and an appraiser testify against him NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump returned Tuesday to the civil fraud trial that imperils his real estate empire, watching and deploring the case as an employee and an outside appraiser testified that his company essentially put a thumb on the scale when sizing up his properties' value. Incensed by a case that disputes his net worth and could strip him of such signature holdings as Trump Tower, the former president is due to testify later in the trial. But he chose to attend the first three days and came back Tuesday to observe -- and to protest his treatment to the news cameras waiting outside the Manhattan courtroom. Star witness Michael Cohen, a onetime Trump fixer now turned foe, postponed his scheduled testimony because of a health problem. Instead, Trump company accountant Donna Kidder testified that she was told to make some assumptions favorable to the firm on internal financial spreadsheets. Outside appraiser Doug Larson said he did not suggest or condone a former Trump Organization comptroller's methods of valuing properties.

Ukraine uses US-provided long-range ATACMS missiles against Russian forces for the first time WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has quietly delivered a small number of long-range ballistic missiles that Ukraine said it urgently needed and that President Joe Biden promised last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Tuesday, saying they were used on the battlefield against Russia and executed very accurately. Today I express special gratitude to the United States, Zelenskyy said in his evening address, adding that the missiles have proven themselves. The YOU.S. has refused to discuss the delivery publicly, but officials familiar with the move also confirmed it earlier in the day. Fewer than a dozen of the missiles got into Ukraine within the last few days, said officials. Their arrival at the warfront gives Ukraine a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before an official announcement and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The delivery of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, was shrouded in secrecy, with the expectation that the first public acknowledgment would come when the missiles were used on the battlefield. That intense secrecy is a marked change from previous YOU.S. weapons sent by the Biden administration. In nearly all other cases, the YOU.S. has publicly announced its decision prior to the weapons and equipment being shipped overseas. Because of lingering YOU.S. concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (about 300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range and carry cluster munitions, which, when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead. According to a YOU.S. official, the ones delivered to Ukraine have a maximum range of a bit more than 100 miles (roughly 160 kilometers). Belgian police kill Tunisian man suspected of shooting 3 Swedish soccer fans, killing 2 of them BRUSSELS (AP) -- Authorities in the Belgian capital shot and killed a Tunisian national on Tuesday hours after they say he gunned down three Swedish soccer fans, killing two of them, and posted a video online in which he claimed credit for the attack and said the Quran was a red line for which he is ready to sacrifice himself. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive for Monday night's attack, which happened not far from where Belgium's men's soccer team was hosting Sweden in a European Championships qualifier. The match was suspended at halftime and the more than 35,000 fans were kept inside the stadium as a precaution while the attacker was at large. Amateur videos of the attack posted on social media showed a man wearing an orange fluorescent vest pull up on a scooter, take out a large weapon and open fire on people getting out of a taxi. He chased them into a building to gun them down. He was also filmed calmly loading his weapon as cars drove by slowly. Sweden's foreign ministry said the men who were killed were in their 60s and 70s, and the man who was wounded is in his 70s and remains hospitalized. Hours after the suspect disappeared into the night and a manhunt was launched, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap Are 3D mammograms better than standard 2D imaging for catching advanced cancers? A clinical trial is recruiting thousands of volunteers -- including a large number of Black women who face disparities in breast cancer death rates -- to try to find out. People like Carole Stovall, a psychologist in Washington, D.C., have signed up for the study to help answer the question. We all need a mammogram anyway, so why not do it with a study that allows the scientists to understand more and move closer to finding better treatments and ways of maybe even preventing it? Stovall said. The underrepresentation of women and minorities in research is a long-simmering issue affecting health problems including Alzheimer's disease, stroke and COVID-19. Trials without diversity lead to gaps in understanding of how new treatments work for all people. Broken rail caused fatal Colorado train derailment that collapsed bridge, early findings show A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. Prosecutors seeking to recharge Alec Baldwin in fatal shooting on set of Western movie 'Rust' SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Special prosecutors are seeking to recharge actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie in 2021, describing Tuesday their preparations to present new information to a grand jury. New Mexico-based prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said they will present their case to the grand jury within the next two months, noting additional facts have come to light in the shooting on the set of the film Rust that killed Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin, a coproducer of the film, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a rustic chapel on a movie-set ranch near Santa Fe when the gun went off on October 21, 2021, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza. Additional facts have come to light that we believe show Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza, Morrissey and Lewis said in an email. We believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of New Mexico citizens to determine from here whether Mr. Baldwin should be held over for criminal trial. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer -- but not the trigger -- and the gun fired. Newsletters Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Biden, who departed for Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, had planned to meet with Arab leaders in Amman after visiting Israel in a show of support for the YOU.S. ally amid its war with Hamas. After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt, a White House official said. Biden sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded, the official said, adding that the president will consult in person with these leaders soon and will remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days. A Jordanian official told NBC News that all parties agreed to the cancellation, saying that the summit would not achieve any goals under the current circumstances. Jordan on Tuesday morning had announced that King Abdullah would host a four-way summit in Amman the following day, with Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the situation in Gaza.

DENVER (AP) -- A truck driver was killed when a train derailed near Pueblo, Colorado, and caused a railroad bridge to collapse onto a major highway -- crushing the semitruck, spilling coal and mangled rail cars across the roadway and shutting down traffic indefinitely, authorities said Monday. The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said a few hours before Biden was set to take off that the trip would be rescheduled.

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. SEMITRUCK DRIVER DIES IN COLORADO AFTER TRAIN DERAILS, SPILLING CARS AND COAL ONTO HIGHWAY The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. 'BIGFOOT' CAUGHT ON CAMERA DURING COUPLE'S ROMANTIC GETAWAY IN COLORADO The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration.

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring more than a month's worth of rain and 70mph winds. The most severe conditions will hit eastern Scotland where a 36-hour amber warning will be in place from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday. Separate yellow warnings have been put in place for Northern Ireland from 2pm on Wednesday until 10am on Thursday, and across vast swathes of Scotland and northern and eastern England from 6am on Thursday to 6am on Saturday. As the storm approaches, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales.

CrossCountry said no trains would run between Exeter and Plymouth from 6.30pm today until 11.30am tomorrow because of the conditions due to hit Dawlish, an exposed part of the line where the railway runs alongside the south Devon coastline. On the Isle of Wight there were no trains at Ryde Pier Head today due to the weather, with a replacement bus in place between the station and nearby Ryde Esplanade. Network Rail said its teams were concerned by the high risk of flooding and strong winds potentially uprooting trees, with weather specialists in its control room considering whether any speed restrictions will be required in Scotland this week. WEDNESDAY: Four days of rain warnings start with one that comes into force tomorrow THURSDAY: This is when the impact based on the number of warnings in place will be greatest FRIDAY: This is the same as Thursday, apart from the Northern Ireland warning which ends SATURDAY: Rain warnings will continue to cover much of England and Scotland on Saturday The Met Office's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain. This graphic shows total rainfall over the course of the warnings from tomorrow until Saturday A Nasa satellite image released today shows Storm Babet approaching Europe last night Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. Forecasters have warned of dangerous driving conditions and 'fast-flowing and deep floodwater' that could pose a danger to life. The warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. Some of these alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During Storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days.

There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves. The heaviest rain is expected in eastern areas of Scotland, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7 to 8 in Scotland, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. Communities in Aviemore, Highlands, Argyll and Bute, and Perthshire were badly impacted October, with weather so bad it was compared to the Beast from the East in 2018. Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83, and large parts of the Scottish rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. A 36-hour amber warning has been activated from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday Before the amber alert was issued today, Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. How Babet was named after a Dutch woman born during a gale Storm Babet was named after a woman from the Netherlands who said she had been born during a gale. The Met Office compiles its annual list of storm names in conjunction with the Dutch and Irish weather services. The Dutch weather service organised an open day last year, inviting visitors to submit suggestions for names - and Babet was among those involved, reported the Daily Telegraph. Further down the list is Storm Elin, which was named after a visitor who said they had a 'tempestuous granddaughter' with the same name. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. 'Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required, and we continue to work with the Met Office to monitor the situation 247. 'Impacts from surface water and rivers are likely, and with catchments saturated from recent heavy rain and flooding, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. 'There is also concern that surface water flooding may be exacerbated by debris blocking drainage, culverts, etc as a result of the high winds. 'If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel. Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: 'A disruptive period of weather is on the way.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers. Sam Hughes, the charity's water safety partner, said: 'The forecasted strong winds along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' Met Office chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. 'It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities.

It comes after southern England experienced its first autumn frost of the year yesterday as temperatures plummeted below zero. Charlwood in Surrey was the chilliest place in England with -1.4C (29F), while the cold snap was also felt in Benson in Oxfordshire, Farnborough in Hampshire and Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the mercury fell to -1C (30F). Gatwick and Stansted airports reported readings of 0C (32F), while temperatures in the Scottish Highlands fell to -2.2C (28F). As many as 35 weather stations reported temperatures below freezing last night, the Met Office said. The last such widespread frost was 172 days ago on April 27. The RAC was fearing an estimated 20 per cent spike in callouts yesterday on what it dubbed 'Flat Battery Monday' as car motors were more likely to fail due to the freezing night. In the Republic of Ireland, Met ireann has issued orange weather warnings for Cork and Waterford as spells of heavy rain and blustery winds were expected to arrive this morning. The Met ireann warning will be in effect from 6am today until 6am tomorrow. The forecaster told residents to expect considerable rainfall combined with 'blustery east to southeast winds at times'. Storm Babet could cause poor visibility, localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide, the forecaster said. Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kilkenny and Wexford were given a yellow rain warning that comes into effect at 6am today. A yellow rain warning for Connacht will be in place from noon today until noon tomorrow, while one for Antrim, Armagh and Down will begin at 6am tomorrow and run until midday on Thursday.",-1

The site was cleared of tons of coal and a half-dozen or more rail cars that plunged off a bridge that was torn away by the derailment. The accident resulted in the death of a 60-year-old truck driver from Compton, California who was headed north on I-25 when the truck was crushed by the debris. Following work by BNSF Railway workers to clear the mess, the Colorado Department of Transportation will work to restore the highway and re-open it. BNSF owns and operated the train that derailed. RELATED: Both directions of I-25 closed after train derails north of Pueblo With that impact, you know that there is going to be some damage. We are anticipating that and we are going to attack the problem as soon as we can so we can get drivers back on I-25, said CDOT spokeswoman Amber Shipley. The National Transportation Security Board said in a statement Tuesday that preliminary information, indicates that a broken rail just to the east of the I-25 bridge caused the derailment. The train was heading south on the east side of the highway and was about to cross over the bridge when the derailment happened. Train cars hit the 65-year-old bridge. NTSB investigators also believe the broken rail preceded the derailment and the bridge collapse occurred after the derailment, the statement went on to say. That will direct less attention to the integrity of the bridge, which showed cracks in its concrete supports in recent Google Map images before the derailment. More concerning is that there appeared to be no warning of problems ahead for the train crew. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warning systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, the NTSB said. Such systems are low-voltage electrical circuits that are an indication of rail integrity. When severed, the signal would indicate a problem. The NTSB's statement does not indicate whether a break in the rail line would have been significant enough to trigger a warning, or if the system was working. What was also unclear Tuesday was who owned the bridge. BNSF said it did not, but the state said there was conflicting information. CDOT Communications Director Matt Inzeo said the department was, going through every document that we have, to look into the provenance of the structure. He said they would reserve further comment until they could, give a definitive answer. RELATED: It could be days before Interstate 25 reopens after deadly Colorado train derailment, Polis says As the highway remained closed in both directions, drivers took Highways 50 and 115 as a detour routing them through Penrose west of Pueblo. It meant more business for places like Coyote's Coffee Den along 115. It is staying steady like this, said supervisor Wanda Massey. Traffic on Highway 50, she described was, way heavier, than usual. It meant a different experience, but one metro area residents know well; traffic jams. It takes 10 minutes to get across town. Fifteen is just too long for me, joked barista Navaeh Copeland.",-1

A KiwiRail spokesperson said the loaded train was travelling from Darfield to Christchurch when the incident occurred, shortly after 7am. In an update about 11am police confirmed the person had died. They were struck on the Mathias St crossing near State Highway 73. Both roads are closed and the Serious Crash Unit has been advised. The KiwiRail spokesperson said there were warning lights and bells at the level crossing. The rail line is currently closed so this morning's TranzAlpine service from Christchurch to Greymouth has been replaced by buses. Police are making inquiries into the collision between the stolen Toyota Prius and the train passing through the crossing. The Prius was driven by what The New Zealand Herald understands were a couple of teens. They had been fleeing police before it was struck by the train.

Initial investigation into a train derailment in southern Colorado suggests the accident was caused by a broken rail, officials said Tuesday. The derailment, which took place on Sunday, sent 30 cars from a BNSF coal train off the tracks, collapsing a bridge over Interstate 25 and killing one person who was driving a semi trailer on the road. A nine-mile-long stretch of I-25, between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, will remain closed for days while crews clean up spilled coal and other debris. Authorities will need to investigate whether the spilled cargo damaged the roadway. Traffic that would normally travel on I-25 is being routed through Penrose, Colorado. Federal investigators will now try to determine what broke the rail, and why train crews did not receive warnings about the damage. SEE MORE: Train derailment closes Colorado interstate It was not known Tuesday whether the affected track had a system in place to monitor stress on track rails. Such systems can provide early warning before an accident occurs, and can stop approaching trains in the event of a track failure. BNSF had not responded to questions from The Associated Press on the matter as of Tuesday. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick told the outlet investigators would determine if the track was equipped with that system as part of their inquiry. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said.

John Rutherford's (R) Florida district while he was opposing Rep. Jim Jordan's (R-OH) Speakership bid in Washington D.C. The brazen late-morning shooting occurred on Interstate 95 near the World Golf Village in Florida's 5th district on Tuesday, causing a shutdown. Per News4Jax: According to the Sheriff's Office, suspects who were riding in the red car opened fire on a victim's vehicle on the interstate around 11:20 a.m. on Tuesday. The victim, who was driving, was struck by the gunfire and crashed into the center guard rail and a female passenger had glass-break injuries. Both were transported to local hospitals but their conditions are unknown. The red car sped off southbound and has not been found, the Sheriff's Office said.A white Mercedes was seen at the scene of the shooting surrounded by law enforcement vehicles including a forensics van. The highway's southbound lanes in the vicinity of World Golf Village were shut down until it later reopened. Rescue vehicles and over a half a dozen police cars were seen amid the pileup around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. As Breitbart News reported, Jim Jordan was denied the Speaker of the House gavel on Tuesday due to 20 Republican holdouts, including John Rutherford. The six Republican holdouts voting for Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Mike Lawler (R-NY), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-NE), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) and Don Bacon (R-NE). McCarthy has endorsed Jordan and voted for him, said the report. The seven Republicans voting for Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) were Reps. Steve Womack (R-AR), Mike Simpson (R-ID), John Rutherford (R-FL), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Tony Gonzales (R-TX), Kay Granger (R-TX), and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL). Scalise withdrew from the race last week after failing to see a path to victory. He, too, voted for Jordan, it added. Democrats have largely celebrated the holdouts as a delay of Jordan's speakership bid. A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier and an insurrection insider to the Speaker of this house would be a terrible message to the country and our allies, said Rep.

Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. High levels of arsenic have been found in ash on Maui, posing a potential health risk to anyone exposed to the debris from wildfires that damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings and claimed the lives of at least 98 people in early August. The findings, along with warnings to avoid contact with the ash, were announced in a news release Sunday from the Hawaii Department of Health. The preliminary analysis of ash from the remains of eight homes burned in the community of Kula also show other toxins including lead and cobalt. (MORE: West Maui Begins Reopening To Tourists) The blaze was one of several fires fueled by high winds and dry conditions in central and western Maui, including one that leveled the town of Lahaina on August 8. Officials expect to find similar toxins in the piles of ash there. Where Did The Arsenic Come From And Why Is It Dangerous? Arsenic is present in building materials made from sugar cane, commonly used in some older buildings in Hawaii. It is also found in Hawaii's volcanic soils. Wildfire ash is known to contain all kinds of toxins from metal, paint, wood, chemicals and anything else that might burn in a fire. But the high concentration of arsenic is of particular concern to Hawaii health officials. While the presence of these substances is not unexpected, the concentration of arsenic in particular demonstrates the high toxicity of the ash and reinforces the importance of avoiding exposure to the ash, State Health Director Dr. Kenneth Fink said. Parents Worry Air Is not Safe For Kids To Breathe Concern over toxins in the wildfire debris is one reason access to Lahaina is still being strictly monitored more than two months after the historic town burned. I feel like it is like back to COVID, where every decision you make is wrong and you are, like, putting your kids' lives at risk, Debbie Tau, who has two school-aged children, told The Associated Press. Tau worries the air is not safe for her children to breathe, and plans to keep them in a different school farther away. (MORE: 911 Calls From Deadly Lahaina Wildfire Show Residents' Terror And Desperation To Escape) School officials say they are monitoring the air quality and taking other steps to help make sure students are not exposed to toxins from the ash. The Department of Education continues to strongly believe that reopening our Lhain schools for in-person learning is critical for the well-being of our students and the community. We have been reassured that our campuses are safe for students and staff to be at based on current air quality conditions and the extensive environmental testing we have done over the last several weeks, DOE Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in the news release. No One Knows When Residents Can Return To Lahaina The Health Department says anyone in the area should take steps to limit contact with toxins in wildfire debris. It is important to remember that people can take action to minimize their exposure to these contaminants, including avoiding disruption of ash and wearing proper PPE when in impacted areas, Fink said. In addition, for people near the impacted areas, keeping surfaces clean of dust and ash and frequent handwashing will greatly reduce exposure. (MORE: Veteran Firefighter Describes Search Through Ashes of Lahaina Fire) There is no specific timeline for when residents might be allowed to return to Lahaina. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen has said it could be up to two years before people can even begin rebuilding their homes and disaster experts say it will take much longer than that to recover. About 13,000 people lived in Lahaina before the wildfire disaster.
