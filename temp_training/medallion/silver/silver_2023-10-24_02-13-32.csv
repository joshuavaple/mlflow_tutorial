The market continued to watch the Middle East turmoil and any indication on harsher sanctions on Iran, who has long backed Hamas. Iran's top authority Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that Tehran had not been involved in the Hamas group's weekend attack on Israel, but he hailed what he called Israel's irreparable military and intelligence defeat. Prices of Iranian oil are flat in China, where most of the cargoes land, and Chinese independent refiners are in no rush to increase their purchases despite the supply uncertainty, several trading sources said. China's appetite for Iranian oil has almost reached a peak as independent refiners are short of crude import quotas and their refining runs are capped by margins, said one source.

While Israel produces very little crude oil, traders remained watchful that if the conflict escalates it could hurt Middle East supply and worsen an expected deficit for the rest of the year. Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world's top two oil exporters, will discuss the situation on the oil market and oil prices on Wednesday amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, Russia President Vladimir Putin's top oil official said. Risks of a broader geopolitical unease in the Middle East and a harsher sanction on Iranian oil seem to wind down. Chinese independent refiners are the biggest buyers of Iranian crude oil. China has reaped savings this year of nearly 10 billion through record purchases of oil from countries under Western sanctions, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from traders and shiptrackers.

Officials warned that low river levels risk disrupting grains exports from nearby farm states. On the Madeira, they said barge routes used by grain firms such as Cargill, Bunge and Amaggi, are open but loads are being reduced as a precaution. Shipping and logistics group A.P. Moller-Maersk warned customers on Wednesday that navigation in the area of Manaus, the largest Amazonian city, was not possible. The depth of the Amazon river at its critical points has reached a level that renders maritime operations in Manaus unfeasible, the company said. Thinning Rivers Could Disrupt Amazonian Grain Exports Maersk said in a separate statement the severe drought has hit 60 of the 62 municipalities in Amazonas state, causing cabotage service to and from Manaus to be temporarily suspended. The captain of the beached boat that tugs the barge, Junior Cesar da Silva, said he had come to pick up supplies in Manaus for Borba, 280 kilometers (175 miles) away on the Madeira, an Amazon tributarywhere water levels have fallen to record lows. As we approached, we ran aground and help came too slow to re-float my boat as the water was receding very quickly, he said in an interview. The Amazon region is under pressure from the El Nino weather phenomenon, with the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon below the historical average and river levels falling near record levels. On the Madeira, beaches and rocks are appearing that we have not seen before, Da Silva said. The heat wave and drought, linked to the mass deaths of fish and river dolphins, has limited the access to supplies by local communities that depend on rivers transport in the rainforest. Cesar said store shelves were emptying out in Borba, where his barge delivers food, drinking water, cooking gas, gasoline and building materials. Brazil's government in September set up a humanitarian task force to deliver food parcels to isolated villages and Indigenous communities. On Tuesday, Indigenous groups in the Amazon asked the Brazilian government to declare a climate emergency as their villages have no drinking water, food or medicine due to a severe drought. As part of a contingency plan, Maersk's local operator Alianca Navegacao e Logstica is diverting vessels bound to Manaus to alternative ports including Vila do Conde and Pecem. Maersk's Alianca expects to reestablish service as soon as navigability conditions allow in mid-November, with restricted capacity, according to Alianca's Brazilian website. Larry Carvalho, a lawyer specializing in logistics, said freight costs were rising as ship programming was being impacted in the Amazon, with critical situations in Manaus and on the Madeira river, where grains companies move produce. Speaking to Reuters by telephone, he said higher freight costs were affecting companies that operate in the so-called Manaus Free Trade Zone area, where fiscal incentives apply to foster the industrialization of the North of Brazil.

On Saturday, the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack against multiple Israeli towns along the fortified border with Gaza. Hamas fighters attacked Israeli soldiers and civilians alike, killing an estimated  in the initial assault. Hamas receives support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and it coordinates with its sponsors in Tehran on major operations, according to defense analysts. Citing Hamas representatives, the Wall Street Journal reports that IRGC officers were present during some of the planning meetings for Saturday's attack, and that Iran gave a green light for the operation. The Journal's sources within Hamas suggested that Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, had personally attended two of these meetings. The Biden administration has asserted that it believes Iranian leadership was surprised by the strike, and likely was not aware of the timing or the scope of the attack. If Israel decides to take retaliatory action against Iranian forces or their proxy groups, Iran could move to restrict transits through the Strait of Hormuz for tankers with Israeli or American ties. The IRGC's naval division maintains a flotilla of small attack boats, which can harass, board and seize merchant ships - or damage them. Elevated risk could raise insurance rates or reduce the supply of tankers willing to make the journey; either would have an effect on the oil market. Any shipping affiliated with Israel is especially exposed, said Cormac Mc Garry, a maritime analyst with Control Risks, speaking to Foreign Policy. Whatever pathway this takes, if Israel retaliates against Iran, and Iran attacks Israeli-affiliated shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, it will be more forceful than Iran's usual attacks on shipping in the strait. Impacts on Israeli shipping According to insurer Gard, the effects of the conflict on Israel's ports are limited, at least so far. The port of Ashkelon is officially closed, given its close proximity to Gaza, but Gard reports that the port authority is giving permission for vessels to berth and unload on a case-by-case basis. Nearby Port of Ashdod is open with restrictions, and it stands ready for business - except for certain dangerous goods cargoes. Explosives and toxic gases have been temporarily banned at the port. Maersk Line has told customers that its cargo operations in the key hub ports of Ashdod and Haifa have not been substantially affected. Road and rail connections to port hinterlands were also moving smoothly. Voyages to these ports have become much more expensive to insure, Reuters reports. War risk premiums have risen by a factor of 10, and now run as high as 0.2 percent of a ship's value. One commercial operator is unlikely to be deterred by any obstacles. Israeli shipping line ZIM, which is part-owned by the government, has declared that its fleet is available to serve the national interest as required. The company ships will be, as a priority, directed to transfer cargo from anywhere in the world to Israel according to the requirements and needs of the Ministry of Defense and the Government of Israel, said ZIM CEO Eli Glickman in a statement. ZIM will support the state of Israel in this difficult time and its first priority will be to allocate the needed resources to aid Israel in this hard and difficult situation.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The United Auto Workers strike finally began to take its toll on the Automotive MMI (Monthly Metals Index) as well as month-over-month steel prices. Regarding price drops, hot-dipped galvanized managed to suffer the most. And with the strike continuing to escalate, negotiations stagnating, and more and more layoffs occurring nationwide, the index faces massive bearish pressure in the immediate future. Overall, the Automotive MMI dropped by 4.51 Jeep manufacturer Stellantis announced that it has laid off more than 500 employees at the Trenton Engine Complex, as well as a smaller number of workers in Indiana. The UAW strike, which led to storage difficulties and a lack of parts, proved the primary reason for the layoff decision. At the moment, 640 Stellantis employees are currently on temporary release due to the strike. Other automakers have also witnessed impacts from the UAW's ongoing protest. Due to the strike at the Chicago Assembly Plant, Ford requested that 71 employees of the Livonia Transmission Plant not report to work on Monday, October 9. Like Stellantis, Ford also experienced a scarcity of parts due to the strike. Ultimately, General Motors (GM) had to idle an assembly plant in Kansas, resulting in the layoff of around 2,000 workers. Economic analysts estimate that the UAW strike has thus far cost the automotive sector 5.5 billion. Indeed, nearly 13,000 GM, Ford, and Stellantis employees took to picket lines over the past four weeks. The UAW has since criticized the Big Three automakers' decisions to fire workers, with union leader Shawn Fain claiming that the Big Three are using the layoffs as a strategy to put the squeeze on our members to settle for less. Ultimately, the strike continues to lower demand for auto steel, adding bearish pressure to already falling steel prices. Indeed, auto companies produced 6,030 fewer vehicles per day due to the UAW strike's effects. The cost of the UAW strike reflects the 16 days that production was halted at one assembly facility in Wentzville, Missouri, which produces mid-size pickups. Because of the strike, Ford has had to let go of around 930 employees. Meanwhile, Stellantis released at least 370 employees in Ohio and Indiana. That said, it is possible that the strike may eventually reduce steel availability and raise steel prices, though only time will tell. After overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year deal, thousands of unionized workers at Mack Trucks went on strike. According to the United Auto Workers (UAW), 73 of its members voted against the proposed agreement. The deal apparently included a 19 pay increase, a 3,500 ratification bonus, improved retirement benefits, additional vacation time for some employees, and a shorter time to reach top pay. About 4,000 Mack employees represent the UAW in three separate states. According to UAW President Shawn Fain, several issues still need to be resolved, including clauses relating to salary, work schedules, benefits, and health and safety. The latest strike is distinct from the UAW disagreement with Detroit's Big Three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, as Mack Trucks belongs to Volvo. Since September 15, the UAW has been striking specifically against the Detroit Three automakers' facilities, with around 25,000 of the 146,000 UAW workers participating. Ford agreed to enhance its salary increase to 23 over four years, potentially raising expectations for union members at Mack due to recent developments in their own negotiations. The Mack arrangement also included an immediate 10 pay hike and nine more percentage points of compensation increases over the course of the five-year contract. When the UAW decided to strike, Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said that the firm was surprised and disappointed, and that the action proved needless. In the past year, workers at FedEx and in the freight rail industry rejected tentative deals before later agreeing.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

A summary of this incident: On a vessel underway, two engine room crew were detailed to clean the engine room ventilator water mist catcher using a pressure cleaner. The job progressed without incident and afterwards, the two crew proceeded to clean the carbon and other debris on the poop deck. One of the crew was holding the lance of the pressure washer when he inadvertently pressed the trigger. The sudden pressure surge produced a hydraulic kick-back force in the lance, and the water jet hit him on his left leg just above the knee. The victim screamed and released the trigger and the lance. The other crew member immediately stopped the pressure washer. Lifting the coverall to reveal the injury showed that there was bleeding from a wound created by the high pressure water stream and that a small portion of the flesh in that area was missing. The victim was given first aid, which was, in this case, sufficient.

This is the latest in a string of indications that the conflict in the Middle East may be escalating, after reports that Israel was strengthening its military presence along the border with Lebanon - home of the Islamist group Hezbollah. We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially toward targets in Israel, said Brigadier General Pat Ryder at a Pentagon briefing following the news of the missile interception, as quoted by the AP and the Times of Israel. Separately, the AP reported, citing an unnamed YOU.S. official, that there had been another strike, this time in Iraq, targeting YOU.S. and coalition partner forces at a diplomatic center near Baghdad International Airport. Per the reports, the missiles were launched by the Houthis who currently control Yemen and are affiliated with Iran's government. With them came several drones, the reports added. ABC noted this was the first time in recent history that a YOU.S. Navy ship had struck back at missiles and drones that were not targeting it. The news will no doubt add to fears of an escalation of tensions in the Middle East, with oil prices having moved higher on the news. Early on Friday morning, WTI had climbed above 90 while Brent reached 93.44. Earlier in the week, oil prices had retreated somewhat on the news that the YOU.S. would lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil, but this latest military escalation appears to have countered that news. The YOU.S. is sending more Navy forces to the Mediterranean to reinforce its presence in the region, with Brg. Gen. Ryder saying By posturing these YOU.S. naval assets and advanced fighter aircraft in the region, we aim to send a strong message intended to deter a wider conflict to bolster regional stability and of course to make it clear that we will protect and defend our national security interests.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Starr Indemnity  Liability Company acting as the subrogee of Target filed suit in the Southern District of New York on October 19 seeking more than 5.8 million. The suit stems from an incident aboard the Maersk Eidenoven containership (13,100 TEU) which happened on February 17, 2021, while the vessel was sailing approximately 45 nautical miles off the coast of Northern Japan. Maersk reported at the time that the vessel experienced an engine stop in heavy seas causing the ship to be unable to maneuver and experience a severe roll. They later determined that the engines on the 11-year-old ship shut down when an indicator recorded low engine oil pressure triggering a safety feature. Propulsion power was quickly restored on the vessel, but it returned to Japan. While in Yokohama, they discharged 65 damaged containers and inspected the bays. The survey showed that the vessel had lost 260 containers in the ocean east of Japan. Maersk said however that there was only minor damage to the vessel and all the required welding and repairs could be completed in Yokohama. The vessel resumed its voyage to Los Angeles at the beginning of March. The lawsuit states that between January 12 and February 4, cargo was delivered to the ports of Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Yaintan, Chia for transport aboard the Maersk Eidenhoven to California. They believe that a total of approximately 57 containers were delivered to Maersk containing various consumer goods. When the Maersk Eidenhoven reached its port of discharge, the suit says Maersk failed to discharge the containers and deliver the cargo in good order. They believe the entire cargo was lost overboard with the suit alleging negligence or breach of duty by the defendants, Maersk and the Maersk Eidenhoven. The suit values the cargo at just over 5.8 million, but reports they have not been paid for the cargo. The insurer reserves the right to increase the value of loss while also seeking a judgment against Maersk and the vessel. Further, they are asking the court to arrest the vessel and order it to be sold to satisfy the judgment. While the case will likely be resolved by Maersk and its insurers, it highlights the continued challenges for the industry over the loss of containers. The years 2020 and 2021 were especially bad for the industry with large casualties mostly related to weather. Nearly 4,000 boxes went overboard in 2020 and a further 2,000 in 2021, according to data from the World Shipping Council. The industry has focused on how large vessels handle in bad seas as one step toward reducing container losses. Multiple companies are also working on devices or systems to better secure containers while they are in the racks and reduce movement in bad weather conditions. The World Shipping Council reported losses had been dramatically reduced to just over 660 boxes in 2022. There are however efforts underway at the I AM GOING TO to increase the monitoring and reporting of container losses.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

China Sea,"Early Sunday morning, the Philippine Coast Guard was escorting a resupply run to the military outpost on Second Thomas Shoal when a China Coast Guard cutter collided with a Philippine supply boat in the convoy, the PCG said in a statement. Later in the same mission, a Chinese maritime militia trawler bumped a PCG patrol vessel. The resupply runs to Second Thomas Shoal involve tense standoffs between the China Coast Guard and the Philippine Coast Guard, and the PCG has to carry out its mission despite resistance from multiple Chinese vessels. China claims ownership of the Spratly Islands and surrounding waters, including areas within the Philippine exclusive economic zone, like Second Thomas Shoal. Beijing has repeatedly ordered Manila to withdraw its garrison from the Philippine station - a wrecked LST, intentionally grounded on the reef 24 years ago - but Philippine forces have held out, and the resupply missions keep bypassing the Chinese blockade. In previous confrontations, Chinese forces have used aggressive maneuvering, water cannons and laser target illuminators to deter Philippine supply boats. The PCG has long warned that these tactics increase the risk of collision, and Sunday's mission appears to confirm that prediction. At about 0600 hours Sunday morning, China Coast Guard cutter CCG 5203 engaged in dangerous blocking maneuvers to cut off a contracted Philippine supply boat, Unaiza May 2, according to the PCG. The maneuver resulted in a collision at a position about 13 nautical miles away from the station on Second Thomas Shoal. During the same operation, a Chinese maritime militia vessel - pennant number 00003 - made contact with the Philippine patrol vessel MRRV 4409 on the port side. The other Philippine supply vessel in the convoy, Unaiza May 1, made it through to the outpost to deliver supplies and replacement personnel. In a statement, the Philippine government's task force for the South China Sea called the Chinese blockade force's actions dangerous, irresponsible and illegal, as well as a violation of Philipping sovereignty and jurisdiction. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that China's historically-based claims to the South China Sea are without merit under international law. China has ignored the ruling and has deployed its gray zone forces - white-hulled coast guard cutters and militia-operated commercial fishing trawlers - to enforce its claims. Philippines suspends military exchange program with China As maritime confrontation between China and Philippines escalates in the South China Sea, the Philippines has suspended its military exchange program with Beijing. The move is a protest by the Philippines over numerous run-ins with the China Coast Guard. Speaking to local media last week, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Philippines (AFP), General Romeo Brawner Jr., said that the decision to suspend the military exchange program with China was contemplated after an August incident in which a Chinese coast guard vessel sprayed water cannons at Philippines military transport ships in Spratly islands. The military exchange program between Manila and Beijing was launched in 2007. It entails Philippines sending five military officers (in the rank of lieutenant colonel or higher) to China for 6-12 months of training every year. The Philippine National Police Academy also sends some of its cadets for specialized training to the Beijing Military Academy and other training facilities run by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). With diplomatic relations between Beijing and Manila increasingly strained, a group of Filipino senators in August demanded that AFP explain why the military exchange program still exists while China continues to harass Philippines. This is indeed alarming. This has to be explained. We have not been accepting cadets from our military treaty ally while we have been sending our soldiers to the country harassing us in the West Philippine Sea. What is the rationale behind this?, said Senator Francis Tolentino during a public hearing of the Senate Committee on national defense and security in August.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Two people have died in Scotland, including Wendy Taylor, who was swept away in the Water of Lee, Glen Esk. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said river levels across the north and north east remained high. But no rain is forecast for the next two days. Angus councillor Gavin Nicol said the full extent of the damage in the Angus town of Brechin had yet to be established. Mr Nicol admitted the town's flood defences, which were upgraded in 2016, now needed to be reviewed. He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: I am hoping the first minister will take pity on us and give us more money for Angus Council. Mr Yousaf is also expected to thank volunteers, the local council and the emergency services for their work in supporting people evacuated from their properties. Speaking ahead of the visit, he said: My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives to the extreme conditions caused by Storm Babet during what will be difficult time. I want to pass on my thanks to local authorities, volunteers and the emergency services for all their efforts in these extremely challenging conditions. Mr Yousaf praised the community for coming together to support those affected and said Angus Council had received hundreds of offers of alternative accommodation for those forced to leave their homes. He added: The process of assessing the full amount of damage caused in all areas affected by the storm is now under way. This will take some time and we are working closely with local authorities to support the people and businesses affected. On Sunday Mr Nicol, who represents the Brechin and Edzell Ward, warned that some residents whose homes were flooded would not be home in time for Christmas. He said parts of the town were still coated in contaminated sludge and silt. Asked when some people would be get back into their homes he told The Sunday Show: It will be an extensive period. A 56-year-old man was killed on the same day as Ms Taylor, 57, after a falling tree hit a van near Forfar in Angus. The storm has also claimed two lives in England, a man in his 60s in Shropshire and a woman in her 80s in Chesterfield. A man who is said to have been trapped in a vehicle in floodwater in Marykirk, Aberdeenshire, remains missing. Meanwhile, the A90 remains closed between Dundee and Stonehaven as experts inspect the road and bridge structures. Energy firm SSEN said it restored power to 37,000 customers during the storm and fixed more than 450 faults across its network. It also confirmed households impacted by power cuts for more than 12 hours were entitled to 30 per person, for every day without power, to cover food and drink costs. SSEN urged customers to keep hold of receipts and claim costs back via its website. ScotRail said most services would be back to normal on Monday but some may start later in the morning in Fife. It added that the Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh line would remain closed until at least Tuesday. The Aberdeen - Elgin route has reopened but the Aberdeen - Dundee line remains closed. Customers are advised to check the ScotRail website before they travel. Scott Prentice, interim commercial director, said: Unfortunately, we are still seeing some extremely challenging conditions on the rail network in Fife, the northeast, and the far north caused by the most rainfall experienced in Scotland since 1891. Our first priority is always the safety of customers and staff, and we will not run services until we are absolutely sure the lines are safe. Meanwhile, the operators of a North Sea drilling platform said it was secure despite losing four of its eights anchors during Storm Babet.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Commons Transport Committee has written to rail minister Huw Merriman to express its concern in particular about how office closures would impact on disabled passengers. Ticket offices across the country face closure under controversial plans that unions and campaigners say will lead to job losses and difficulties for passengers such as the elderly and disabled in paying for travel. In the letter, dated October 20 and signed by Conservative MP and committee chair Iain Stewart, MPs also express concern about the 'unacceptable' lack of information about the proposals from operators, the Rail Delivery Group and the Department for Transport. Plans that would see the widespread closure of ticket offices go 'too far, too fast', cross-party MPs have warned Commons Transport Committee chair Iain Stewart (pictured) has written to rail minister Huw Merriman to express concern about how office closures would impact on disabled passengers Mr Stewart told the minister: 'We therefore consider that the proposals as put forward by train operating companies in this consultation go too far, too fast, towards a situation that risks excluding some passengers from the railway. 'At a minimum, changes this radical should be carefully piloted in limited areas and evaluated for their effect on all passengers before being rolled out. 'This would allow for the alternative proposals, which at present are too vague, to be properly understood.' The letter notes that while it is acceptable for operators to adapt to changing passenger behaviour, many passengers have 'legitimate concerns about whether closing a ticket office would remove the support they need'. Mr Merriman is expected to respond to the letter in due course. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: 'While these are industry proposals, we have been consistently clear that the industry must ensure that the quality of service for passengers is maintained to a high standard. 'The public consultation has now closed and independent passenger representatives will review the responses with train operating companies shortly.' A spokesperson for Rail Delivery Group said that it would 'continue to engage with accessibility and safety groups'. A placard during a protest organised by the RMT opposite Downing Street, London, over the proposed closure of railway station ticket offices in October this year They said: 'In preparing these proposals, train companies drew on experience from the 42 of stations that do not currently have ticket offices, and worked with customers and accessibility groups to ensure that all passengers are supported. 'While implementation plans have not yet been agreed, the industry understands the importance of the feedback received, and will continue to work closely with Transport Focus and London TravelWatch throughout the process. 'This includes exploring the potential for using a phased approach to introduce changes, with regular review points to assess how well they are working. 'During evidence to the Transport Select Committee (TSC), train companies explained that they would continue to evolve their plans. 'The proposals will see staff with additional training out into ticket halls and concourses to provide face-to-face support with a whole range of needs, and no station currently staffed will become unstaffed.'",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Mrs Gilbert's son shaken Paul Gilbert today told how his mother dead on the bottom floor of her flooded home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He had desperately tried all he could to protect her house on Friday morning spending hours putting up flood defences and believing the near 4ft-high flood barrier would be enough to stop the waters. He had heaved her bed upstairs in case the worst happened and an hour after he left at around midday he received a panicked phone call from Maureen saying the waters were seeping through into her home. He asked her to get all of her stuff ready and to go upstairs before making the seven hour journey back where he discovered her home was flooded. Firefighters smashed the rear window but were unable to gain access to the property despite the water 'being up to Paul's eyes' and they stopped the doting son from trying to get in himself, he claimed. They promised Paul they would try again on Saturday morning but after waiting for a call that never came, the son went to his mother's home at 9.30am and forced the window open where he discovered Maureen dead floating in the water. Anne Squires, 38, has been forced to start again after flooding ripped through her house. The married mother-of-one said: 'I have been here since I was 13. It was my mums house. Maureen was a lovely lady. She was lovely. It is sad, we knew her. 'I am refusing to move out, I am disabled and so is my husband. I have chronic blood clots so I need my oxygen while walking about.

'Everything has gone down here. Everyday items have gone here, you need to start from scratch. It is the time and effort. 'This is my second time, I went through it in 2007.

Her daughter-in-law has told how chest-high flood defences in the doorways were overcome when the River Rother burst outside, with water 'pouring over at rapid speed'. In a crowdfunding appeal, Kaye Gilbert said the property in Tapton Terrace, Chesterfield, had previously flooded in 2007. It was not insured because the family had been quoted a 10,000 excess to clean and restore it following flood damage. Teaching assistant Mrs Gilbert, 47, lives in the nearby village of Clowne with husband Paul, also 47, a landscape gardener. She wrote: 'After a sleepless night, my husband and son found my 83 year old, housebound, mother-in-law, had passed away. 'She had unfortunately been unable to escape upstairs at the speed the water levels were rising. 'Not only do we have an uninsured house as the excess for flood damage was over 10,000 to clean and restore but a funeral to pay for all whilst grieving. 'She lived on the street all her life, rebuilding after the 2007 flood was hard for us and her but this is just devastating. We now only have memories as everything else is gone. 'My husband put his mothers flood defences up to his chest in the doorways and made preparations to secure the house as he has done many times during such weather warnings. 'However, when the river burst, the water just came pouring over at rapid speed and the defences did very little. 'The waters were much higher than the 2007 flood and came with a faster flow and pressure which resulted in my husband being stopped from trying to enter the property to check on his mum.' Neighbours said Mrs Gilbert had been housebound for around three years and is thought to have been attended to daily by carers. A nearby resident told the Mail widower Mrs Gilbert, who had a second son, John, 44, had been bed-bound and unable to escape the raging torrent. 'I spoke to one of her neighbours who said she was bedbound', the resident said. 'The water has come up above the bed. 'It is awful. It is given me nightmares thinking about that poor lady.'

They found 'a woman, aged in her 80s, inside the flat.' The spokesman added: 'The woman was found in a flooded property. Enquiries are ongoing into the circumstances of her death. But the because of her death is unascertained at this time.' A major incident was declared in the county on Friday due to rising river levels, but Derbyshire Dales District Council this afternoon said major incident status had been removed in the county as river levels in the upper Derwent began to fall. Heartbroken Paul has been back to the mid-terraced house today to try to salvage any sodden belongings from the property. A heartbroken friend today said of Maureen: 'She was such a character, she was a massive football fan, she was a big Liverpool fan and followed Chesterfield too. 'I am devastated, it is just heartbreaking it could have been allowed to happen. I think questions need to be asked. 'Surely there should be a central database of housebound residents so they can be made a priority for help?'

Hours later, a 56-year-old man was killed by a falling tree close to Forfar, 20 miles away; police say he was pronounced dead at the scene. A man in his 60s was swept away by flood waters in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire on Friday. Elsewhere, police are said to be treating a crash in Halifax that killed a 19-year-old man and a pile-up on the M4 that killed two women, both on Friday, as being related to the inclement weather conditions. And a man and a woman were killed after their car plunged from a bridge near Skipton, North Yorkshire, on Saturday afternoon; officers have not stated whether the car left the bridge as a result of the stormy winds and heavy rain. A search is also under way in Aberdeenshire after police received a report of a man trapped in a vehicle in floodwater. On Sunday, Nottinghamshire County Council declared a major incident in the town of Retford, which sits on the River Idle, and has advised residents of some 500 homes to leave. Water levels on the Idle hit 2.56m as of 12pm on Sunday - the previous record was 2.4m in 2007. In Retford, emergency services have been seen speaking to people on their doorsteps as water pours into residential streets up to knee height. Lifelong resident Brendan Hunt, 54, detailed how he moved as many of his possessions upstairs as possible, placing other furniture and appliances on wooden blocks eight inches off the ground in a bid to minimise the risk of water damage. He said: 'Water was coming up through the storm drains and it just got deeper and deeper until one side of the road's water joined the other side of the road. 'Then it filled the pavements, then it filled everybody's gardens. It got to within millimetres of coming in the front door. 'It is still right up to the threshold of the front door... the Environment Agency says before 8pm tonight there is another 30cm on its way.' Nottinghamshire County Council said in a statement issued Sunday: 'These Severe Flood Warnings have been issued because of flooding in Thrumpton, Retford, as a result of Storm Babet. 'Residents in all of these areas are being asked to prepare to evacuate their homes. Emergency services are supporting residents to evacuate where needed. Please make sure you leave your homes when directed to do so.' Elsewhere in Nottinghamshire, nearly 50 horses and ponies were evacuated after floodwater deluged the St Leonard's Riding School And Livery Stable in Toton. Sally Carnelley, 69, and her daughter Tara, 39, keep about 22 of their own horses and ponies on-site, also caring for some 28 livery horses. Ms Carnelley told the PA news agency: 'It is devastating. It looks like an earthquake. It is like the earth has moved, it is moved all the floor.'

And even as the storm abates, forecasters have already issued a fresh weather warning as a cold snap looks set to bite overnight into Monday. The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' warning for ice covering most of mainland Scotland as well as parts of northern England; the forecaster warns Brits to expect 'icy patches' and to take care to avoid 'slips and falls on icy surfaces'. The yellow weather warning stretches from the very top of Scotland down to Corbridge, around 20 miles west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and runs from 9pm on Sunday until 9am Monday. The warning covers the major Scottish cities as well as the Angus and Aberdeenshire regions, which have been devastated by flooding during Storm Babet. Temperatures will hover just above freezing in the Highlands and Borders regions overnight, according to the forecaster; further south, overnight temperatures will be a relatively balmy 12-13C. While Babet has passed, the storm has flooded out Britain's rail network; Environment Agency bosses say that flooding is likely to last until Tuesday. Katharine Smith, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, says teams have been sent to the worst-affected areas to operate flood barriers and put up temporary defences, including pumps to get rid of flood waters. She added: 'Following persistent, heavy rain from Storm Babet, severe river flooding impacts are probable in parts of the East Midlands and South Yorkshire...into Sunday. 'Ongoing flooding is probable on some larger rivers including the Severn, Ouse and Trent through to Tuesday. 'We also advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.' In Brechin, east Scotland, where hundreds of people have been evacuated, local councillors say some residents are unlikely to get home before Christmas after river levels surged to more than five metres. Local authority Angus Council had spent millions on a flood defence scheme for the region that was meant to provide protection against a 'one-in-200 year' flood; the works for the 3.8m barriers were completed just seven years ago. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Show, local Tory representative Gavin Nicol said: 'There is sludge and silt everywhere - it is contaminated sludge and silt - and it will take a fair bit of cleaning up. 'It will be an extensive period - it will take a fair bit of sorting...these houses will not be ready by Christmas. 'I am hoping the First Minister will take pity on us and give us some more money for Angus Council.' Brechin residents who returned to their homes on Sunday found 'mind-blowing' devastation caused after the South Esk burst its banks. David Stewart, 68, said: 'It is just absolutely mind-blowing. The devastation looks even worse than I thought.' Brian Petrie, 66, returned to find the lower floor of his house covered in silt and mud, with the carpet squelching as he walked and the fridge upended. His 92-year-old mother had to be rescued, as he recalled: 'The Coastguards and paramedics got her down the stairs in a stretcher and took her in a dinghy up to the ambulance.' George Wilson, 66, returned to find 'awful' damage in his home, adding: 'I am still trying to get my head around it.' In remarks reported by the Press and Journal, Angus Council environmental officer Jacqui Semple said there may be some residents who will never be able to return to their homes after the floods. She told a media briefing: 'There remains concern that parts of River Street could completely give way and it is unlikely that some residents will (ever) be able to return to their homes. 'The amount of water that flooded onto the street was significant and the full extent of the damage is unknown. 'Parts of the road have completely crumbled away and that could have a significant impact on the future of the street.'

Throughout Sunday, disruption is expected on LNER, Scotrail, Northern, Transpennine Express, Greater Anglia, Transport for Wales, CrossCountry and East Midlands Railway services. LNER has advised its customers to not travel north of Edinburgh, and there are no services operating from the city towards Aberdeen or Inverness. ScotRail said routes remain closed between Aberdeen and Dundee, and Aberdeen and Elgin. The Scottish train operator said they can not run services on the Fife Circle route, or between Inverness and Wick, Thurso and Kyle of Lochalsh. Services are also disrupted across parts of Yorkshire and East Anglia with some routes still flooded, Network Rail said. LNER said urgent repairs are taking place at Plessey Viaduct and there is a limited service between Morpeth and Newcastle. Caledonian Sleeper services are said to be running as normal between Scotland and London - but there is a 'high probability' of them being affected. Routes across the East Midlands have been suspended or partially suspended until Monday; East Midlands Railway says it will honour tickets bought for the weekend until the end of Tuesday. In a statement published on its website on Sunday morning, National Rail said: 'Disruption to trains is expected on some routes until the end of the day. Please check your whole journey before travelling.' Clean-ups are underway in communities across the country as the flood waters finally began to subside. Derby City Council said they are seeing record-breaking water levels in the River Derwent - which left much of the village of Sandiacre underwater - and warned that cleaning up after the floods could take several days. Wedding photographer Harvey Morgans, who captured dramatic footage of the submerged streets, was left stunned by what he saw on his drone. He said: 'It is affected everyone on the street, devastated a lot of people's houses and livelihoods. 'The knock on effect over the next few months - people replacing cars and fixing property - will be massive.' It comes as 59 people and 12 animals were rescued from flooded homes in neighbouring Stapleford. In Sheffield, South Yorkshire, 120 homes have been evacuated in the Catcliffe area after devastating flooding. The River Rother reached heights of 30.44m, exceeding the level it reached in 2007 when the area was ravaged by disastrous floods. Derbyshire Fire Service said more than 100 people had to be rescued in the county on Friday, including 20 people at a care home in Duffield. In Wales, a severe flood warning had been issued for the village of Llandrinio, Powys, as well as isolated properties in the Severn-Vyrnwy confluence area. In the North Sea, more than half the staff manning a drilling platform were airlifted to other sites after several of its anchors came loose during Storm Babet.

The rig is located around 146 miles east of Aberdeen. Stena Drilling said four out of eight anchors became detached from the drilling unit because of the severe weather. Rest centres were set up in Angus with more than 50 people opting to stay in one in Brechin after they were evacuated from their homes as the River South Esk breached the town's flood defences early on Friday morning. Residents of nearby Bridge of Dun had to be airlifted via helicopter, while in other areas people stranded by flood waters were rescued by boats, including canoes. Scottish justice secretary Angela Constance, who chaired a government meeting on the country's 'exceptional' rainfall on Saturday, said: 'The impact will be felt in communities for some time to come.' National Rail has warned of major disruption on the railways until the end of the day due to both flooding on the railways and the weather displacing train crews - meaning some services have been unable to run at all. Police closed down King's Cross Station yesterday due to overcrowding, as rail bosses begged passengers to use different terminals amidst the chaos. Temporary crowd control measures were instated by police before eventually being lifted at around 5pm - even as operators advised passengers not to travel. Passenger John Hinson, who has Parkinson's disease, said he felt safer holidaying in Jordan - which lies between Syria and Israel - for the last two weeks than he did arriving at the London terminal. He told PA: 'It was just so dangerous. I have Parkinson's and I have difficulty walking, so my wife went to ask for assistance and all assistance was cancelled. 'We were basically told that if we cannot get the train, we need to cancel and come back again.'",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Derbyshire Police said a woman in her 80s was found dead at a home in Chesterfield, central England. Her death was being linked to flooding in the area. In nearby Derby, the River Derwent reached its highest-ever recorded level on Saturday during a storm that brought 8 inches of rain to parts of Britain. Since Thursday, at least five people have died in the storm - named Babet by the UK's Met Office - that swept through Britain, northern Germany and southern Scandinavia with powerful winds, heavy rain and sea surges. Some of the worst flooding was in eastern Scotland, where more than 300 homes were evacuated in the town of Brechin and residents told to leave before the River South Esk breached its banks Friday, surging almost 13 feet above its usual level and sending water pouring into the streets. The weather calmed on Sunday but flooding continued to cause disruption to road and rail travel across a large swath of central and northern Britain.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

DAFF is collaborating with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and the exporter to address the incident. All animals on board are unaffected. AMSA confirmed that the fire was promptly extinguished and that no injuries were sustained by the crew or livestock. AMSA issued a notice under the Navigation Act instructing the ship to proceed to the nearest available wharf in Darwin to discharge the cattle. The incident comes as the live export industry faces heightened scrutiny following a number of high-profile accidents as well as animal welfare concerns. Earlier this year, New Zealand took the step of ending livestock exports by sea, citing animal welfare concerns following the sinking of the Gulf Livestock 1 in 2020 with the loss of 6,000 cattle bound for China and all but two of its crew members. The Brahman Express was built in 2002 and is owned and operated by Vroon Group's Livestock Express. Equasis data shows the ship was last inspected in July and no deficiencies were found.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article
