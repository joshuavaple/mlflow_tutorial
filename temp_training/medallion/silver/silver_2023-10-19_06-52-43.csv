Gov. Jared Polis announced the reopening after touring the derailment site with federal, state and local officials on Wednesday. The interstate reopened at approximately 3:15 p.m. Colorado Department of Transportation crews are working to make available at least one lane of northbound I-25 by Thursday evening, according to a news release from Polis' office. Federal investigators said Tuesday they believe a broken rail just east of the bridge over I-25 caused the derailment and subsequent bridge collapse on Sunday afternoon. The incident killed a truck driver, 60-year-old Lafollete Henderson of Compton, California, and covered the roadway with coal and at least six overturned train cars. Drivers should expect a rough driving surface on the damaged roadway as it is being milled and repaved, according to state officials. There will be slightly reduced speed limits in the area. In a statement, Polis said getting the highway back open is a top priority. Though the investigation is still ongoing, it remains clear that investments in rail are needed now more than ever and Colorado has been working for months to take advantage of historic safety and rail funding from the federal government, Polis said. CDOT Executive Director Shoshana Lew said the cleanup was an all hands on deck approach, and that BNSF Railway is taking the lead on rebuilding the bridge, according to a statement from the governor's office. CDOT crews have been working up to 22-hour shifts to reopen the highway, state Sen. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo said in a post on X.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

DENVER (AP) -- Authorities in Colorado say the driver of a semi-trailer truck was killed when a train derailed and a bridge collapsed, spewing coal and mangled train cars across a major highway near Pueblo on Sunday (October 15, 2023). Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez says the driver has died, but no further details were available. No other vehicles were involved. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending investigators to the site about 114 miles south of Denver.

Jim Jordan as House speaker before backing another GOP lawmaker said she received death threats and threatening phone calls after casting her vote on Wednesday. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, revealed the death threats in a statement just hours after Jordan failed to secure enough votes in the second round of balloting for House speaker. Since my vote...I have received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls. The proper authorities have been notified and my office is cooperating fully, Miller-Meeks said in a statement that was also posted on X. One thing I cannot stomach, or support is a bully, she added. Someone who threatens another with bodily harm or tries to suppress differing opinions undermines opportunity for unity and regard for freedom of speech. Jordan has come under criticism for the aggressive tactics of his supporters in their efforts to get him elected speaker. Shortly after Miller-Meeks' post, Jordan tweeted: No American should accost another for their beliefs. We condemn all threats against our colleagues and it is imperative that we come together. Stop. It is abhorrent. A representative with YOU.S. Capitol Police could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. Miller-Meeks did not specify which law enforcement agencies, if any, were notified about the threats against her. A spokesperson for Miller-Meeks was also not immediately reached Wednesday night for additional comment. Miller-Meeks on Wednesday voted for Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a day after she voted for Jordan. She said Granger has demonstrated great leadership this year by bringing forth, and passing, fiscally responsible, single-subject appropriations bills and is a staunch conservative. Jordan is the only candidate in the race for House speaker, but he is failed to win over enough support from rank-and-file Republicans to get elected in a formal floor vote. The Ohio Republican, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, announced his intentions to seek the speaker's gavel after the House ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the top post this month. Earlier candidate Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., failed to garner enough backing, leaving Jordan as the lone contender for speaker. He will likely need the support of 217 of the 221 House Republicans to be elected. Jordan received 200 votes on Tuesday and 199 on Wednesday. Another House vote is possible on Thursday.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The bridge subsequently collapsed onto the roadway, killing a truck driver and necessitating the highway's closure. Early information from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that a broken rail led to the train's derailment, and the derailment in turn caused the bridge to partially collapse onto the interstate. I-25 remains closed in both directions just north of Pueblo at mile marker 107 with numerous train cars and capsized loads of coal scattered on both the northbound and southbound lanes. Southbound lanes are scheduled to reopen during the afternoon of October 18; northbound lanes will remain closed until crews are able to make further assessments and give more specific updates. Local and regional traffic is being rerouted. According to a Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) press release, BNSF and CDOT officials have already started discussing how to make necessary repairs to the roadway as soon as NTSB gives clearance. Cleanup began on October 16. The timeline of repairs will be made publicly available when the involved entities determine the schedule. The NTSB's preliminary report on the derailment will be available in mid-November, followed by a final report in 12-24 months. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warning systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, the NTSB said in a statement to media. Yanling Leng, a lead bridge engineer with IMEG Corp. in Sioux Falls, S.D., pointed to the bridge being built in 1958 as a more likely because for the bridge's failure than a construction defect. The primary factors contributing to the issue were likely the rail's aging and deterioration, Leng said.

Investigators are examining how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, according to the NTSB. A 9-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 - used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily - was shut down as crews cleared hundreds of tons of spilled coal and mangled railcars from the roadway. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Pueblo. The southbound lanes of I-25 were being repaved Wednesday and were expected to open later in the day. Crews were working to open the northbound lanes by Thursday evening.

During Tuesday's news conference, Mulroy also announced that no charges would be filed in the death of Jarveon Hudspeth. Videos from the three other cases were posted online at the Shelby County District Attorney's website after the news conference Tuesday. Here are details of each shooting and what the videos show. Melissa Horton Horton, 43, was killed on March 18 in Bartlett. Two deputies from the Shelby County Sheriff's Office pulled over her vehicle after learning from the Fayette County Sheriff's Office that she had attempted to shoot her fianc. When the deputies commanded Horton to exit the car, she lifted a shotgun and pointed it at one of the deputies. The deputies fired, killing Horton.

A moment later, an officer yells something about a shotgun and the two officers back away from the car while firing multiple shots. Latoris Taylor Taylor, 40, was killed on December 9 in the Westwood neighborhood of Memphis. According to a news release from the Shelby County District Attorney's Office, he was seen in a stolen car and ran as a Memphis police officer approached in his patrol car. That officer chased Taylor on foot, during which Taylor turned and fired two shots at the officer, who returned fire, killing Taylor, according to the news release. Officer body-camera video shows an officer exiting his vehicle, running, then firing several shots. Video from a security camera in the neighborhood shows a man running, firing at someone behind him, then dropping to the ground in a front yard, presumably shot. A large number of officers quickly arrive on the scene and approach the man. Corey Brewer Brewer, 45, was killed June 3, 2022 at Interstate 40 and Whitten. He was wanted in connection with a fatal shooting of a woman earlier that day at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake. After stopping the car, Brewer pointed his gun at an officer and four Memphis police officers returned fire.

Investigators are examining how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. Built in 1958, the steel bridge collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25. The main north-south highway through Colorado is expected to remain closed for several more days, and hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars should be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, crews will assess the damage. The driver of a semitrailer truck who was killed while passing under the bridge was identified as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California. He is survived by six children and 15 grandchildren, said his daughter, Endaya Jenel. I will never get another call from him while he is on the road! Talking for hours on the phone at 5am. My heart is broken in more ways than one! Jenel wrote in a social media post. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection and did not immediately respond to emailed questions or requests to view its inspection records. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of the railway's main routes between Denver and Texas, where BNSF is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those warning systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles (48 kilometers) miles west of Pueblo. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The accident remains under investigation.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

(AP) - Several days before a Norfolk Southern conductor trainee was killed by a metal beam protruding from a parked railcar on the next track, workers at a YOU.S. Pipe facility noticed the beam was hanging off the top of the car but never told the railroad about it, federal investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board released those details this week in a report on the interviews it conducted after Walter James Griffin was killed near Bessemer, Alabama, on December 13. Investigators will not release their final report on the death until later. The accident happened as Griffin's train was passing another train that was in the process of picking up several cars that had been parked on a siding, including ones loaded with scrap metal from YOU.S. Pipe's nearby facility. The beam struck Griffin in the head as it smashed into the locomotive he was riding in and injured the conductor sitting behind him with broken glass. The death was one of the incidents the NTSB cited when it announced it would conduct a broad investigation into Norfolk Southern's safety practices after a fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. That February derailment prompted a national reckoning on rail safety and calls for reforms. NTSB investigators interviewed the crews of both trains and YOU.S. Pipe workers and reviewed security videos in the days after the Alabama accident. Video taken on December 7 showed a piece of metal hanging off the top of the railcar at YOU.S. Pipe's facility. At one point, a worker there even put up caution tape around the railcar because of the metal hanging off of it. But that caution tape was gone before Norfolk Southern's crew arrived to pick up the car. This incident was a tragedy, and our thoughts remain with Mr. Griffins family, friends, and colleagues. Were continuing to work closely with the NTSB as they complete their investigation, the railroad said in a statement. It declined to answer questions about the accident because of the ongoing investigation. YOU.S. Pipe officials did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday. Griffin's family sued Norfolk Southern in the spring over his death. That lawsuit remains pending. Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest freight railroads, operating in the eastern United States.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Heavy downpours and severe winds are forecast for much of central and northern Scotland from Thursday morning through to Saturday night. The Met Office has warned Storm Babet will likely mean delays and disruption for road, rail and ferries over the next few days, with high-sided vehicles on exposed routes at risk. They have confirmed a high impact Amber warning for rain covering parts of Stirling, Perthshire, Aviemore, Moray, Angus, Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City from Thursday morning (0600) until Friday evening (1800), however, this is subject to continued review. Details are available on the Met Office (external link) website. The warnings follow some of the heaviest rain Scotland has witnessed since the 1890s and could hit some already saturated and flooded areas. The Multi Agency Response Team will be fully operational at the Traffic Scotland National Control Centre alongside the Transport Scotland Resilience Room to monitor conditions, respond to any major conditions, and to help co-ordinate messaging and communications. The weekend of 7 and 8 October saw 100 to 150mm of rain falling widely across a swathe of the Southern and Central Highlands. The current forecast rainfall amounts indicate that some areas in northeast Scotland could see 150 to 200mm of rain over a two to three day period. The rain will be accompanied by strong east to south-easterly winds. Stein Connelly, from Transport Scotland, said: We recently witnessed some of the most severe weather in Scotland since the 1890s, and another wave of challenging conditions is expected this week. I would again ask the public to plan ahead and be prepared. Check before your travel as your journey is likely to be affected by these latest severe weather warnings - whether by foot, bike, car, rail or ferry. The Multi Agency Response team will be in operation to monitor conditions and co-ordinate our response, however, the public can play a key role by delaying their journey, where appropriate. Latest Police Scotland advice is to expect a high risk of disruption, however, this could change over the next 24 hours, so please check the Traffic Scotland and Police Scotland social media updates and local radio bulletins for the very latest updates. Chief Superintendent Hilary Sloan, Head of Road Policing, said: Our advice is to plan ahead and consider if your journey is really necessary or if it can be delayed until conditions improve. Stopping distances can be at least double on wet roads compared to dry conditions, and spray can reduce driver visibility. If you need to travel, please drive to the conditions, be prepared for delays and allow extra time for your journey. Phil Campbell, ScotRail Customer Operations Director, said: The Met Office has issued weather warnings from Thursday through to Saturday, with an amber warning for heavy rain across eastern Scotland, and yellow warnings for heavy rain and high winds in central and northern Scotland. We will continue to monitor the forecast, and teams will be working around the clock to deal with any weather-related incidents that Storm Babet brings. Our first priority is always to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. We ask customers who are planning to travel to keep an eye on our website, app or social media feeds for live updates.

Wednesday was a testing day for people living in the path of Storm Babet, which disrupted quite a few areas. Cork got a particularly bad lash from the storm, as readers are no doubt aware. If your smartphone was working yesterday, you probably saw the footage which was being uploaded from all over Cork. That footage showed scenes which custom dictates we describe as unprecedented and shocking, but they were also frightening, to be honest. Streets were flooded in and around Cork, with people reporting areas which had never been flooded before being inundated. There was traffic gridlock in many parts of the city during the day and it was clear that some cars had simply been abandoned in rising waters. People who had commuted to work could not get back home, or got back home hours later than usual; both rail and bus services in Cork were seriously affected by the weather. The litany of black spots is depressing, and in some cases depressingly familiar: Blackpool flooded, for instance, but so did Glanmire village and roads were impassable in Ballyvolane, Rochestown, Blarney, Tower, and elsewhere. The Straight Rd flooded when the Lee itself burst its banks. East Cork suffered severely. The Defence Forces were called in to help people in Midleton, which was simply impassable, its main street under several feet of water and dozens of premises flooded. Killeagh was flooded a few miles further east, while the Ladysbridge-Cloyne road was a no-go zone, damaged by floodwater. At the border of Cork and Waterford, the walls were collapsing along one stretch of the N25 by the sea outside Youghal. This morning, aprs le dluge, the questions arise, naturally enough. For instance, Met ireann issued an orange warning for Cork (given before expected weather conditions that could significantly impact people, property, and activity in an area, according to met.ie). Should that have been a red warning (rarely issued but when it is, people in the areas expected to be affected should take action to protect themselves andor their properties)? On the basis of their own definitions, a red warning should have been issued for Cork. As reported here, Met ireann will be issuing fewer Status Yellow weather warnings in future, with the forecaster set to re-evaluate the thresholds for such warnings as it acknowledged concerns about warning fatigue from the public. Unfortunately, that was a little late for Cork this week. A red warning yesterday morning would have closed schools and immediately cut the number of journeys being made; as it turned out, some schools made the decision to close early anyway, but that meant parents had to make the journey to collect children at the height of the rainstorm. It is also clear that people commuted to work in the belief that an orange warning heralded testing but not dangerous weather -- only to find conditions far more perilous later in the day. Another question: Is it acceptable that a 21st-century city should be so seriously affected by heavy rainfall? One of the traditional replies on Leeside to such queries is to point out that for hundreds of years the low-slung city of Cork, central marshy island and all, has been susceptible to riverine flooding at high tides, a victim of its own geography. Yet the obvious retort is that if this has been common knowledge for hundreds of years, surely it is past time for a solution. Instead, there have been years of uncertainty and dispute about a proposed flood defence scheme, with no sign of progress while the city is literally inundated. It should be acknowledged that the amount of rain which fell yesterday was calamitous -- by some measures a month's rainfall fell in approximately 24 hours. That amount of rain would test the best-prepared drainage systems. Can we say that yesterday was exceptional as well as calamitous, however? Climate change is likely to produce more such events, not fewer. And if those future events occur on the same scale, as is widely expected, then a different response will be needed. Multi-agency approach A co-ordinated, multi-agency approach involving municipal and State agencies will be necessary if lives are not going to be lost in future extreme weather events. Are we going to need a Cork rain tsar, a single figure who will take temporary control of the city when it is in danger of being flooded to pull the various agencies together? Would not that be better than what we experienced yesterday? Looking into the future means seeing where other headaches are likely to occur down the line. We have seen in recent years, for instance, that there are ambitious plans for developing and expanding Cork -- to create an entirely new suburb, more or less, down on the Docklands-Marina area. But how meaningful can those plans be if the area itself or adjacent arteries such as the Centre Park and Monahan Roads are likely to flood, as happened yesterday? Or if the entire city can be paralysed by heavy rain? Ambitions of Cork acting as some kind of regional counterbalance to the concentration of population and resources in Dublin are laudable. However, based on this week, it looks like they will not survive their first encounter with prolonged rainfall. Credit must be given to those who defied the elements yesterday to help others. The people who helped neighbours and friends stranded in cars by rising waters. Those who were invited into bars and restaurants for shelter and food, particularly in the Midleton area. Sarsfields Hurling Club in Glanmire opened the gates to its main playing field to let flood water run off which would otherwise have flooded local homes and businesses. The club, which won the Cork senior hurling title just last Sunday, explained their motivation in a statement: As a result, our main pitch essentially became a flood plain in order to relieve the flooding to the immediate Riverstown area, Orchard Manor, and surrounding businesses. We won a county, lost a pitch, but hopefully saved a part of the Glanmire community. Those are the gestures which show what a community really is. Sars' actions were proactive and decisive, qualities much in demand yesterday -- and not on show everywhere they were needed -- but the city as a whole cannot rely on the spontaneous generosity of voluntary organisations. This week's events must be seen as the turning point. Cork needs that specific plan with a local focus, preferably managed by an individual with the authority and power to co-ordinate the various bodies involved when the floods threaten again. And to overrule central assumptions on the basis of local evidence, if need be. If not, then the city can be expected to grind to a halt again when the next rainstorm hits. Or squelch to a halt, to be more accurate. A co-ordinated multi-agency approach involving municipal and State agencies will be necessary if lives are not going to be lost in future",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

An Oregon man who sexually assaulted women inmates while working as a nurse at a correctional facility was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in prison, federal prosecutors said. Tony Klein, 39, committed the assaults at the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which is Oregon's only state prison for women, from 2010 to 2017, officials have said. He began abusing women around 2012, according to prosecutors. He was found guilty in July after being previously indicted on charges of depriving the victims of their constitutional right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Natalie Wight, YOU.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, in a statement praised the courage and resolve of his victims. She said the sentence sends a clear message that using a position of authority to prey on individuals in custody will never be tolerated by the Department of Justice. Klein made up reasons to get some women alone, the YOU.S. attorney's office said. He assaulted others during or around the time of medical appointments, it said. The defendant preyed on his victims, knowing that they would not dare report his crimes, because they would not be believed, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum. Prosecutors had asked for a 41-year sentence. Seventeen women testified against Klein at trial. Some said he forced them to have sex, while others said they believed they could face discipline if they refused his advances, the Associated Press reported when he was convicted. Klein was found guilty by a jury on 17 counts of depriving his victims of their constitutional rights and four counts of perjury.

The RapidX trains are all set to commence passenger operations from October 21, a day after its scheduled inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The six-coach RapidX trains will have one premium class coach while the remaining five coaches will be standard. The NCRTC, the agency executing the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project, released the fare for the 17km priority section in Ghaziabad. This will be country's first RRTS stretch to commence passenger operations on a 17km section comprising stations of Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai Depot. The fares have been defined from station to station and the present fare charges will be applicable for travelling between five stations of the priority section, said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer, NCRTC. According to the rolled out fares, a passenger on a standard class coach will have to pay 50 for travelling from Sahibabad to Duhai Depot, while a traveller on the premium coach will have to pay 100 for the same distance. Most of the commuters who travel between Ghaziabad and Sahibabad will have to she will out 30 up to the Sahibabad RRTS station for travelling in standard class coach and 60 for premium class travel. According to the fare chart, the per kilometre cost of travelling on the full 17km priority section is 2.94km in a standard coach and 5.88 on a premium coach. According to the 2009 project report on the RRTS project, the initial fare was expected to be 2 per kilometre for the entire 82km network.This figure was expected to climb further owing to inflation and price hike. Normally, a hired auto in Ghaziabad may charge anything from 100-150 for the 17km distance between Sahibabad and Duhai Depot. The auto may charge between 75-90 to travel from Ghaziabad to Sahibabad.The option of Metro is not available between the two points. But Delhi Metro sources said 10 and 60 are the minimum and maximum fares for travelling on the Metro network. Explaining the rationale for the RapidX fares, NCRTC officials said these were decided after a comprehensive study by IIM-Ahmedabad. All factors were analysed before finalising the fare. These factors included the consideration of cost, viability, fare in other similar transport mediums across the globe and also the factor of realisation of cost. RapidX is altogether a different system from Metro trains and the two cannot be compared, said a spokesperson from NCRTC. The NCRTC officials said children below 90cm height will be allowed to travel free while various ticketing options have been put in place for passengers. These options include digital QR code based tickets phone app RAPIDX Connect, national common mobility card (NCMC), ticket vending machines (TVMs) and paper QR code-based journey ticket.

A Louisiana man is accused of setting a New Orleans home on fire and killing three children Tuesday. Joseph Washington, Sr., 29, was arrested in New Orleans a day after the fire that killed his three children, ages 8, 5 and 3, police said in a statement. The children's mother called 911 at 11:55 p.m. and said she was at work but their father was threatening to burn down their house, according to police. Audio of the call played by NBC affiliate WDSU of New Orleans inlcudes the mother telling a dispatcher that someone is on the phone threatening to set the house on fire and to please hurry. Moments after the 911 call, a fire was reported, police said. The 8-year-old and 5-year-old were rescued but died at a hospital, and the 3-year-old was found dead inside the burned home, police said. Washington faces three counts each of second-degree murder and second-degree cruelty to a juvenile, and one count of aggravated arson, police said. He was being held in custody Wednesday night, according to jail records. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney. He jumped from an overpass before he was arrested and was taken to a hospital for an evaluation of possible injuries, New Orleans police said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately - ATACMS proved themselves, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the YOU.S. administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Zelenskiy's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 190 miles (310 km). The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a YOU.S. Army website says. Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a new chapter of the war had begun. There are no more safe places for Russian troops within the ... internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, he wrote on X. Russian military bloggers commented on the attacks during the day, with Telegram channel Fighterbomber saying Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS. Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS for the first time on Tuesday. Since starting a counteroffensive in June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in Russian-occupied areas, but it has failed to liberate significant territory from Russian occupation. Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern group of forces, told national television that there had been no letup in Russia's week-old assault on the devastated town of Avdiivka in the east, with Ukrainian forces repelling 10 attacks. Shtupun also said Ukrainian forces advancing southward to the Sea of Azov had registered partial success west of Verbove, one of a cluster of villages it is trying to capture. The Ukrainian military said Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter.

Jim Jordan's supporters is sparking backlash from Republican holdouts, making it harder for him to become the next House speaker. Several GOP lawmakers, as well as one member's spouse, have reported a barrage of calls and messages pushing them to back Jordan, R-Ohio, in his struggling candidacy. One even said she is received death threats. Rep. Don Bacon's wife this week has received anonymous, threatening text messages pressuring her to persuade her husband to support Jordan. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., said his staffers have been cussed out in phone calls from Jordan supporters. And Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said he was so upset with pro-Jordan robocalls to voters in his South Florida district that he personally told Jordan to call off the attack dogs. On Wednesday night, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, said in a statement that she would received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls after she switched her vote to another Republican during the second-round vote. Jordan's foes, who for the past two days have blocked him from winning the speaker's gavel, are facing an aggressive pressure campaign from the Ohio Republican's allies and conservative grassroots activists to stop their opposition and flip to yes. But the bloc of roughly 20 anti-Jordan Republicans say they are not caving and that those hardball tactics from Jordan allies are actually backfiring. One thing I cannot stomach, or support is a bully, Miller-Meeks said in a statement, adding that she will not be intimidated. Someone who threatens another with bodily harm or tries to suppress differing opinions undermines opportunity for unity and regard for freedom of speech. In a post on the social media site X, Jordan condemned the violent threats and called for them to stop: No American should accost another for their beliefs. We condemn all threats against our colleagues and it is imperative that we come together. Stop. It is abhorrent. Moments after Jordan was rejected on a second ballot for speaker Wednesday, Gimenez recounted a tense phone call with Jordan a day earlier. Robocalls -- they are not free. So somebody is actually funding this. And then he told me that he was not behind it and he is asked people to stop. But if you have asked people to stop it, why are not they listening to you? Gimenez told reporters just off the House floor. I told him 'I do not really take well to threats' ... Matter of fact, if you threaten me, I would probably go the other way, he continued. I probably head into the wind, not away from the wind, because if you succumb to threats and intimidation and all that, the rest of your life you will just be threatened and intimidated. Speaker nominees typically use carrots -- including subcommittee gavels, seats on powerful panels and fundraising promises -- to win over skeptics. It was a strategy deployed by California Republican Kevin McCarthy, the consummate insider, to secure the speaker's gavel in January. But with the speaker vacancy happening in the middle of the session, Jordan has few carrots to hand out. Jordan's struggles emphasize the degree to which his rise is owed to his outside game, such as his talents for activating the conservative grassroots, making a splash on right-wing media and lighting up social networks with passionate GOP-leaning voters. His struggles also expose the weaknesses of his inside game, such as member-to-member relations and balancing fragile coalitions -- skills that have historically been staples of successful speakers. It is terrible. I dare say you are not really a Jordan ally if those are the tactics you are using, because it is just completely counterproductive, said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, a Jordan supporter. Sticks will not work with these people, Crenshaw added. I asked a lot of those original 20 against McCarthy who might think sticks work. But I am like, it did not work on you! It is not going to work on them either. One close Jordan ally, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, said his colleague has tried to turn down the heat but that outside pressure always exists in speaker's races, including McCarthy's back in January. Jordan spokesman Russell Dye said the congressman is not behind any of the attacks on his detractors and has called for them to stop. Mr. Jordan has not made any threats, or encouraged any attacks on any members voting against him, or encouraged any attacks in any way. Neither has our team, Dye said. The Jordan defectors are not buying it. I think he is absolutely responsible for it, said Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., who said his office has been inundated with aggressive calls from Jordan supporters. It does not work. Nobody likes to have their arm twisted or talking about individual's wives ... That is just not acceptable. Bacon's wife, Angie, this week began receiving text messages from unknown numbers, pressing her to try to flip her husband's vote to yes. Why is your husband causing chaos by not supporting Jim Jordan, begins one of the texts Bacon shared with NBC News. Your husband will never hold elected office again, the sender wrote, when Bacon's wife asked them to identify themselves. Tell your husband to step up and be leader, reads another text shared by Bacon. More publicly, conservative media stars, including Sean Hannity of Fox News and Steve Bannon, host of the The War Room, a livestreamed show, have also been urging the holdouts to back Jordan. But the pressure campaign is clearly not having the desired effect, with Jordan losing 20 Republican votes Tuesday and 22 on Wednesday. To be elected speaker, he can afford no more than four GOP defections in his quest for the 217 votes needed to win. Jordan is headed for defeat. He will fight to death likely, and we will not let off, Bacon told NBC News on Wednesday. Their tactics angered us. They are harassing our spouses even. Jordan hit a brick wall. Womack, one of the handful of House appropriators who have voted against Jordan, said his staffers have been dealing with continuous profanity-laced phone calls from supporters furious about Womack's no votes. They have been cussed out. They have been threatened. I am not talking bodily threatened, they have just basically said very unkind things to my team. And it is been nonstop, a furious Womack told reporters. And most of these are out-of-state calls; very few of them are from my district. ... But when my staff has to absorb the brunt of this, you know, kind of verbal assault, then that is just unacceptable. These tactics will not work with us. If the whole battle plan was to attack them, give him time to expose those members and go after them, then it is an abject failure, Womack added. They did not read the room very well, and they do not know these members very well.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The rail operator said that on Thursday, services between Glasgow Queen Street and Aberdeen  Inverness, and between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen  Inverness will be affected by the suspensions. It comes as Storm Babet is expected to hit parts of Scotland on Thursday, with life-threatening downpours forecast. Due to the red weather warning and the likelihood of flooding and poor driving conditions, customers on these routes are advised not to travel as no alternative transport is available. The train operator expects the line closures to last until early Saturday, October 21, however this is dependent on weather conditions and any repair work to railway infrastructure that is required. Other routes across the network will be impacted by precautionary speed restrictions, meaning services may be subject to delay or cancellation. The full list of suspended services are as follows: Customers are advised that they should only travel if necessary on the routes affected by the weather warnings, to expect delays, and to check their journey before travelling on the ScotRail website, mobile app, or social media channels. Customers whose journey has been cancelled or disrupted due to adverse weather can travel one day before or two days after the date on their ticket. Customers can also apply for a fee-free refund on any unused tickets. David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: The Met Office has issued red and amber weather warnings for Storm Babet, with heavy rain across eastern Scotland, and heavy rain and high winds in central and northern Scotland. We know the impact that the withdrawal of some train services will have on customers, but our first priority is always to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. This is a necessary step to ensure everyone is safety during the severe weather. In order to keep our customers and staff safe, speed restrictions will be in place as a precautionary measure on other routes in Scotland, which will mean longer journey times. For routes in the south and west of Scotland, customers are encouraged to check their journey before setting off, and keep an eye on our website, mobile app, or social media channels for live updates. Storm Babet is set to bring a month's worth of rain within 48 hours across parts of the country. Areas of Angus will see up to two months of rain fall over the same time frame. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is very likely there will be a risk to life.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the other team was behind the blast, citing data he had been shown by the YOU.S. Defense Department. Preliminary estimates of deaths at Al Ahli Arab Hospital vary from 200 to 800, World Health Organization officials said at an emergency press conference late Tuesday. Injuries were estimated to be in the hundreds as well. Aside from patients and health care workers, many civilians were also sheltering in and around the hospital, expecting it to be spared from attacks, as mandated by international humanitarian law. Palestinian officials had been quick to say it was an Israeli airstrike, but the Israel Defense Forces say that intelligence traces the attack to a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. As he met with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday, Biden said it appeared as though the attack was done by the other team, according to multiple news outlets. But before Biden departed for the meeting, the YOU.S. government had not yet drawn a conclusion as to who was to blame for the bombing, CNN reported Wednesday, citing an anonymous YOU.S. official. The question of who was behind the attack has massive implications, with the Arab world in particular on edge, with protests in support of Palestine in many neighboring countries. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was midair during the organization's emergency press conference Tuesday, but expressed his shock and condemnation through Dr. Michael Ryan, the organization's executive director of health emergencies, who spoke for him. But Ghebreyesus tweeted shortly after the attack, condemning it and calling for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, as well as for Israel's evacuation order for northern Gaza to be reversed. Al Ahli Arab Hospital was one of 22 hospitals in the north end of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from Israeli forces -- an order the WHO, UN, and other agencies have said is impossible to carry out due to insecurity in the area, the critical condition of many patients, a lack of ambulances, and a lack of alternative shelter, among other factors. Combined, hospitals in northern Gaza were treating more than 2,000 patients, WHO officials said Tuesday. Since the beginning of the war October 7, four Palestinian hospitals have been rendered inoperable due to damage or targeting, they said Wednesday, adding that its Gaza warehouse was now barren. Health workers are having to make impossible choices to ration what little they have left in supplies, the agency said in a Wednesday tweet, adding that health workers are operating without anesthetics. Israeli forces on Friday ordered the evacuation of all people in northern Gaza in 24 hours as they prepared for a large-scale ground offensive. As of Wednesday, that offensive had not yet started. Many speculated it would not occur before Biden's meeting with Netanyah on Wednesday. Egypt's Rafah crossing, the only potential entry point into Gaza, remained closed Wednesday, preventing thousands of pounds of humanitarian aid from entering the war-torn territory.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

With the water chest high in Midleton's Darling Buds pre-school, a spokesperson for the creche said that adults helped remove children by piggy back after staff and children became trapped inside. Similarly, parents had to wade through waters at the Educate Together National School to collect their children. The main road in Midleton was under 3ft feet of water, while the town itself saw roads both in and out of the area become impassable after the Owenacurra River burst its banks -- requiring assistance from the army and civil defence. Problems were exacerbated shortly after lunch time, when the wind and rain caused two power outages, one on either side of the town. ESB engineers were unable to wade through the floods before three more faults were recorded in the afternoon -- including one near the community hospital in the town. Local Councillor Susan McCarthy described bins, traffic cones, benches and even a skip floating on the street. Its even dangerous wading through it, she said. At one stage a man was seen kayaking down the street to check on people trapped in their businesses and homes. Locals stranded Independent Cllr Liam Quaide told the Irish Examiner that the flooding in Midleton really shows our vulnerability to climate change and the need for adaptation as well as mitigation. I was bringing my daughter home from CUH and I cannot get to (our home) in Broomfield, because both ways are blocked. We are stranded in the Market Green centre where some people we have met have been waiting here for several hours to get home. All rail services between Cork and Cobh and Cork and Midleton were suspended due to water on the line. Cork County Council confirmed that more than 100 properties were flooded in the town. One of those belonged to Himalaya Yoga Studio on Mill Road. Maeve O'Brien from the studio said that they had been hit very hard She explained that due to the floods, they could not reach the studio to fully assess the damage. It is a huge blow for all the businesses in Midleton. Ideally, we would open our doors tomorrow but we are not too hopeful of that. Ms O'Brien said it was absolutely crucial that all stakeholders worked together to get a flood relief system in place to prevent future issues. Councillor Danielle Twomey said the flood was the town's worst in living memory. She was one of the parents of children at Midleton's Educate Together School who had to wade through knee-high water along Mill Road to get to the school. We drove our cars as near to the school as we could and then just waded out to the school, she said. I was there to collect my two daughters and although the school itself was not flooded, the road to it was like a river. The water subsided after a while but when we went to collect our children, we had no idea how bad things would be. We did not want to take any chances. So, you had this scene of parents wading through flood waters with children on their backs. I have never seen anything like it in my life. She said several estates and Midleton hospital were under a metre of water and access to Midleton from Cloyne was cut off. A rest centre was established in the town's community centre to facilitate those who required evacuation. Meanwhile, in Killeagh, the historic Thatch pub and restaurant was under a metre of water after the adjacent River Dissour burst through at about 9.30am. Proprietor Debbie Walsh said the water was unstoppable and had nowhere to go as it swept across the beer garden and into the bar, kitchen, and store room. The pub, which dates from the mid 1600s, was almost destroyed by fire prior to Debbie and husband Brian taking it over seven years ago. The force of the water was actually dangerous, Debbie recalls. The devastation has been extremely distressing and we are exhausted, she added, but we will clean up and carry on. We are likely to be closed over the coming days, she added. Imokily GAA secretary Patrick Mulcahy said the flood was the worst in the area and that many older generations have never seen this before. Youghal's town centre escaped flooding but some estates and walls in the town were severely affected. A section of wall that was being restored and scaffolding collapsed on Lighthouse Hill, while a huge pond was created at Chestnut Drive estate, as fast-flowing torrents ran downhill. Resident Shane Tobin said a wall collapse redirected almost two metres of water from the rear of his house at the last minute. Meanwhile, James O'Connor TD, who surveyed flood damage in Midleton, said questions need to be asked about why there was not a red weather warning. The level of damage to Midleton and surrounding areas as far as Glanmire has been devastating There is a real sense of destruction, he said. Business have been flooded, the Defence Forces are here on the street, the community hospital has been evacuated and I see school children being brought up the main street on the back of trailers. People were not expecting this and it begs the question: why there not a red warning provided last night? Where was the red warning? The amount of water has been biblical. Water is running out under doors on the Main Street. It is just soul destroying. The Main Street is ruined. He said that what is needed now is support for families and businesses hit by the flooding. People are needing support and luckily the Park Hotel has started hosting families.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The ministry said traders by October 21 last year had exported 11.5 million tons. The ministry said 1.05 million tons of grain were exported in the first 17 days of October. Ukraine exported 2.83 million tons from October 1-21 a year ago. The ministry gave no explanation for the decrease. Traders and farmers unions have said blocked Ukrainian Black Sea ports and Russian attacks on Ukrainian ports on the Danube River are the main reasons for lower exports. The exported volume included 3.99 million tons of wheat, 3.04 million tons of corn and 654,000 tons of barley. Ukraine has traditionally shipped most of its exports through its deep water Black Sea ports. A deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey allowing such exports collapsed in July when Russia withdrew, saying its demand that sanctions be lifted on its grain and fertiliser exports had not been met. Ukraine's shipping sources said 34 cargo vessels had entered a fledgling Black Sea shipping corridor as Kyiv steps up a push to defy the de-facto Russian blockade. Ukraine can also export limited volumes through small river ports on the Danube and via its western land border with the European Union. Ukraine is expected to harvest 79 million tons of grain and oilseed in 2023, with 202324 exportable surplus totals of about 50 million tons.

The warning is in place for parts of Scotland from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday. Yellow alerts for rain cover eastern England and the rest of Scotland on Friday. The agency said the storm could cause exceptional rainfall reaching up to 250mm. The red warning states there is danger to life from fast flowing or deep floodwater in Aberdeenshire and Angus, with extensive flooding and road closures expected. Humza Yousaf, Scotland's First Minister, said that travel should be avoided unless absolutely essential. Mass rail closures were announced for eastern Scotland until Friday, with lines from Perth to Aberdeen and to Aviemore not running. Network Rail said trains between Aberdeen and Elgin are also cancelled. Aberdeenshire Council alerted residents to significant supplies of sandbags that it had stockpiled to protect their homes from flooding. The red warning alerts people to the danger of communities becoming cut off for days. The last red warning for rain was in February 2020 when Wales was hit by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest recorded levels and more than 1,400 homes and businesses flooded. At least three people died. On Wednesday trains were suspended in Greater Manchester after a tree was brought down onto overhead power lines. Cornwall and Devon were battered by gale force winds and heavy rain with 45mph gusts in coastal areas of the South. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution warned that the storm poses a safety risk to those visiting the coast and that the public should exercise extreme caution, particularly near cliffs, seafronts and piers. In the Devon town of Paignton, several beach huts were destroyed in the extreme weather as waves battered the seafront. Sean White, of watersports company and community club Soak Lifestyle, in Torquay, said on Facebook: One of our shipping containers, our sports one, ended up in the ocean and the other one has been bashed like a washing machine. We have lost everything, and obviously that is totally devastating and we are lacking words among all the emotion right now. Mr White added that he did not account for the storm surge which made an extra metre or so tide that we had not anticipated. He and his business partner Laura Rickard managed to arrange for cranes to save the container that held their coffee shop by lifting it away from the seafront.

One crewmember was reportedly seriously injured and transferred to a local hospital with burns, but the injuries are being called non-life threatening. The cruise ship, the Ocean Navigator (4,954 gross tons) operated by Hornblower Group's American Queen Voyages, had docked in Portland around 7:00 a.m. arriving from Halifax, Canada at the end of a coastal cruise in Canada. The local fire department said it received reports of smoke coming from the ship at around 7:25 a.m. and dispatched its units. By the time they arrived, the crew was controlling the fire and they assisted in ensuring the fire was out. People working at the terminal told local reporters that they saw smoke and believed they heard an explosion from within the ship. The cruise line and YOU.S. Coast Guard are reporting that it was a generator fire and it was contained to the engine room. There were 128 passengers and 82 crew aboard the ship. The passengers were all evacuated into the terminal and according to city officials have now been moved to a local hotel. None of the passengers were injured. A Coast Guard prevention and response team reported to the site as well as the ATF, Maine State Fire Marshall, Maine State Fire Investigator, Portland Fire Department, and Customs and Border Patrol. At the last report, teams were working to vent the cruise ship while an investigation was also underway. The Ocean Navigator was built in 2001 as a modern version of an American coastal cruise ship and was to have been named Cape Cod Light. Her original owners went bankrupt, and she sat idle for years before a series of different operators managed the ship. She is 286 feet in length with accommodations for 202 passengers. The ship was due to spend tonight in Portland and embark passengers tomorrow for a 10-day cruise to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maine before ending in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on October 27. Passengers for the trip have already arrived in Portland and were due to spend tonight in a hotel before boarding the cruise ship. Based on the company's website, the upcoming cruise was her last scheduled trip. Earlier this year, American Queen Voyages announced they would discontinue the operation of the Ocean Navigator and her sister ship Ocean Voyager focusing instead on the company's river cruises. The sister ship Ocean Voyager is in Halifax today and is due to arrive in Portland on October 20. The YOU.S. Coast Guard reported this afternoon that the Ocean Navigator is currently not permitted to sail as there is an ongoing investigation. American Queen Voyages reports they are assessing the damage and local weather conditions to determine if the next cruise will sail as scheduled.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Thirty of the 104 rail cars tumbled off the tracks over the interstate Sunday afternoon, crushing a semi-truck and spilling coal all over the roadway. The train derailed just before 3:30 p.m. as it was crossing I-25 on an overpass 4 miles north of Pueblo, officials said. A semi-truck was crushed in the accident, killing the driver. No injuries were reported for the train crew. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones, Governor Jared Polis, who is scheduled to visit the crash site Wednesday morning, said in a statement. Our immediate priority is safely getting the highway open both ways. The Pueblo County Coroner's office has identified the truck driver as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, CA. He is survived by six children and 15 grandchildren, said his daughter, Endaya Jenel. Governor Polis announced that the closed section of southbound is being re-paved and is expected to re-open this afternoon. CDOT is working to re-open northbound I-25 no later than tomorrow evening and if necessary CDOT may open a single lane prior to re-opening the entire road. Motorists should expect a rough driving surface as the damaged roadway will be milled. There will be slightly reduced speed limits temporarily through the stretch to ensure the safety of drivers. Governor Polis toured the damage with the National Transportation Safety Board alongside local legislators, county leaders, staff from the state's federal delegation, and Mayor Gradisar of Pueblo. The preliminary investigation has revealed that a broken rail just east of the bridge over I-25 likely caused the coal train to derail and the bridge to collapse. Our top priority is to get the highway back open so that people can continue traveling safely between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, and the rest of the state, said Governor Polis. Though the investigation is still ongoing, it remains clear that investments in rail are needed now more than ever and Colorado has been working for months to take advantage of historic safety and rail funding from the federal government.

The Syrian government has announced the resumption of operations at Damascus International Airport as of noon on Wednesday. This decision comes after necessary repairs were carried out to address the damage inflicted by Israeli airstrikes on the airport the previous week. On the afternoon of Thursday, October 12th, Israel conducted simultaneous missile strikes on the international airports of Aleppo and Damascus, resulting in damage to their airstrips and rendering them non-operational. The Syrian state news agency, SANA, quoted an unnamed military source who reported, At approximately 13:50 on Thursday afternoon, the Israeli enemy carried out a coordinated missile attack on the international airports of Aleppo and Damascus, causing significant damage to their runways, forcing them out of service. Axis of Resistance Takes Three Steps to Reassure Israel in Southern Syria On October 13th, the Syrian Ministry of Transport announced the reopening of Aleppo International Airport, effective the following morning. The ministry stated that air traffic at Aleppo Airport would resume after repairs were made to address the damage caused by Israeli airstrikes. The announcement also indicated that airlines could schedule flights and manage passenger services through Aleppo Airport. Additionally, Latakia International Airport would continue to operate as an alternative to Damascus International Airport, which was still undergoing repairs to address the damage caused by the simultaneous Israeli attacks. Subsequently, on October 14th, Israeli aircraft once again targeted the airport, resulting in its closure. However, the Ministry of Transport reported that the airport was able to resume operations on October 16 after necessary repairs were made to the runway. Simultaneous bombardment According to a high-ranking security source who spoke to the Russian agency Sputnik on condition of anonymity, Israeli aircraft launched several missiles from over the occupied Palestinian territories, targeting the vicinity of Damascus airport. Simultaneously, other planes fired guided missiles at Aleppo International Airport from positions over territorial waters off the Syrian coast. In a rare admission, the Israeli army spokesman, as reported by Channel 10, confirmed that the airstrikes on the airports in Aleppo and Damascus were a direct response to mortar shells fired from Syria. The spokesman also issued a warning of further strikes on additional targets in the coming days. As a result of the bombing, the plane carrying the Iranian foreign minister had to alter its course and return to Tehran since it was unable to land at Syrian airports, according to a diplomatic source cited by Sputnik. This marks the second such incident in October. On the 3rd of the same month, Israeli warplanes conducted an airstrike in eastern Syria, specifically targeting military sites near Deir-ez-Zor governorate. This attack resulted in injuries to military personnel, as reported by SANA.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A North Carolina family is demanding answers after their loved one's body was found facedown on the lawn of an empty home where a groundskeeper saw it, mistook it for a prop dummy, and mowed the grass around him. The body of Robert Paul Owens, 34, was found on October 10 at an abandoned log cabin used by several law enforcement agencies for trainings on Shue Road in the small town of China Grove, about 35 miles northeast of Charlotte, the China Grove Police Department said. One day prior, on October 9, a groundskeeper saw the body as he was mowing the property, but believed the body was a fake dummy used for training and as a result did not report it, police said. A construction worker on the property reported the body to police the following day. Haley Shue, Owens sister, told NBC News her family is heartbroken that her brother's body was not reported sooner. The body was exposed for so long they will not be able to have an open casket memorial for him, she said. She remembered her brother as a kind person whoadored his nieces and nephews. The family suspects foul play in his death, she said. Shue said her family last saw Owens on Sunday October 8. That day he spent time with a friend, went to a gas station and got a ride from a friend back to his grandmother's house where he lived. Later, he was picked up by someone to visit another friend, but did not return home. The abandoned home where he was found on the lawn is near his grandmother's home, but it is a property he had never been to before, his sister said. She described the property as off the main road, down a long driveway with woods on either side, and not visible to neighbors. On Tuesday October 10, Shue got a call from her mother saying no one had heard from her brother in two days. Later that same day, the family was notified by police that Owens' body was found, identified by his tattoos. But, Shue said, police refused to tell the family where he was found, the state he was in or how he may have died, simply saying he did not have a gunshot wound. As of right now no family member has laid eyes on him since this occurred, Shue said. She and her family took it upon themselves to find the house where his body was found, where they found a construction worker who reported Owens' body to police. He said he found Owens face down in his underwear and socks with one arm under him, one arm out with marks on his arms that he took as what looked to be defensive marks, Shue said. You can only think what is running through our mind. He does not have any of his clothes, where is his clothes? Where is his belongings? Where is his wallet, his cellphone, shoes and all that? she said. That construction worker told Shue and her family that the groundskeeper saw Owens' body the day before. His words were that the groundskeeper assumed that my brother was Halloween decor or a mannequin and I guess he took it upon himself to assume that and not verify and mowed the entire property, Shue said. It just blows our mind how someone can not stop and verify, this is a strange Halloween decoration, or a strange mannequin or dummy, why would officers leave this behind? she added. The family was further frustrated to find that there was no crime scene tape or signs of preserving the scene. We just feel they should have protected the scene for a little while, Shue said. Preliminary findings from an autopsy conducted Friday ruled out any signs of assault or trauma to the body, police said, noting that a toxicology report is pending to determine because of death. There is definitely some sort of foul play. We have been briefly told by police about some glass around his body. We do not know if that glass is from a car or something else, Shue said. There is no broken glass on the house. Now the family is asking for the public to call in with tips if they saw or heard of anything suspicious in China Grove on October 8 that can help solve what happened to Owens. Someone is involved in this and someone knows of this property and knows that the house is there to have brought him there, Shue said. The family has created an online fundraiser to cover Owens' funeral costs. That is something we have to live with, knowing no family ever identified him. No family got to say any final goodbyes to him. We just want to bring awareness to it, Shue said. We miss him dearly.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Ukrainian forces used US-supplied long-range ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) missiles for the first time, inflicting heavy damage on two airfields in Russian-occupied areas, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying on Tuesday (Oct 17) that the weapons had proven themselves. The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately -- ATACMS proved themselves, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the US administration for ATACMS. Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Zelenskiy's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 190 miles (310 km). The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a US Army website says. Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a new chapter of the war had begun. There are no more safe places for Russian troops within the ... internationally recognised borders of Ukraine, he wrote on X. Russian military bloggers commented on the attacks during the day, with Telegram channel Fighterbomber saying Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS. Citing two unidentified US officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS for the first time on Tuesday. Since starting a counteroffensive in June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in Russian-occupied areas, but it has failed to liberate significant territory from Russian occupation. Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern group of forces, told national television that there had been no letup in Russia's week-old assault on the devastated town of Avdiivka in the east, with Ukrainian forces repelling 10 attacks. Shtupun also said Ukrainian forces advancing southward to the Sea of Azov had registered partial success west of Verbove, one of a cluster of villages it is trying to capture. The Ukrainian military said Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

(KDVR) -- Gov. Jared Polis announced Wednesday that the I-25 southbound lanes affected by the October 15 deadly train derailment north of Pueblo will reopen on later this afternoon. The northbound lanes are expected to reopen Thursday afternoon, hopefully in the afternoon, according to Polis. Polis was in Pueblo to view the deadly train derailment site, which killed a 60-year-old Californian truck driver when his semi-trailer was crushed under the bridge. Federal investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board released preliminary findings on Tuesday, showing that a broken rail likely caused the crash. BNSF, the rail company operating the train, told reporters the railway was inspected earlier on Sunday, before the derailment. Specific to this area, BNSF conducted a combination of rail detection testing, advanced track infrastructure testing and visual inspections within the last three months, including the most recent inspection that occurred on Sunday, October 15 prior to the derailment, said Lena Kent, BNSF general director of public affairs.

The derailment sent 30 railcars off the tracks, collapsing the steel bridge on top of a passing tractor-trailer, crushing the cab and killing the 60-year-old driver inside. Federal investigators are now examining the fatal incident and why it happened despite the warning systems in place. The fatal derailment last Sunday left a nine-mile stretch of Interstate 25 closed near Pueblo, Colorado, according to the Associated Press. The closure is expected to last the next few days as the bridge's wreckage, crumpled railcars and tons of coals still block the roadway. While assessing the bridge and highway damage will be a priority once the debris is cleared, investigators will look into how the systems in place to prevent derailments like this failed. The AP reports: The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection and did not immediately respond to emailed questions or requests to view its inspection records. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of the railway's main routes between Denver and Texas, where BNSF is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. It will be vital for investigators to determine precisely when the rail broke. If the track came apart when the train was traveling over it, then there was nothing the crew could have done to avoid the derailment. If not, then the focus will shift toward the automated warning systems. All possibilities for a because are still on the table including intentional sabotage and vandalism.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A 4.2 magnitude earthquake was felt across California's Sacramento County and parts of the Bay Area on Wednesday morning, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The quake hit southern Sacramento at 9:29 a.m, exposing the towns of Rio Vista and Isleton to 'Moderate' shaking. It was initially estimated to be magnitude 5.7, but was downgraded. There was light shaking across 5 nearby towns, including Oakley and Discovery Bay, and weak shaking in Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose, said the USGS. There have been no reports of damage or injury. An emergency alert instructing people to Drop, Cover, and Hold On was sent to mobile phones across the area, reported NBC affiliate KCRA. The San Francisco Bay Area train service BART delayed trains for 5-8 minutes to conduct track inspections. The earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 6.7 miles from the earth's surface, according to the USGS. The intensity of shaking during an earthquake diminishes as the depth increases. That is why the 4.8 magnitude earthquake which hit California at a depth of 19.2 miles on Monday had a lower impact. The earthquake struck just a day before the statewide Great California ShakeOut earthquake drill, where 10.1 million people across the state will practice how to be safer during large earthquakes.

Cork City and county bore the brunt of the massive rainfall, with homes flooded, roads closed, businesses forced to shut and many properties left without electricity. Emergency personnel have been working tirelessly over a 24-hour period rescuing people from their homes, motorists trapped in cars and trying to pump flood waters from roads and estates. Such was the extent of the apocalyptic rainfall that members of the Defence Forces had to be deployed to parts of East Cork. Streets and all the quays in the city centre were flooded, with motorists warned not to drive into the city as cars were forced to be abandoned on the southside. Meanwhile, a family had to be rescued from their apartment on South Terrace. Towns and villages throughout the country were particularly badly hit, with Midleton and Glanmire seeing severe flooding, resulting in the closure of businesses. Midleton town was completely cut off with flood waters entering businesses and homes, while many properties had been evacuated. The flood water was so high it was touching the roofs of parked cars, and people could be seen wading through the floods in the area with water lapping around their waists, including one man carrying a Labrador dog. Shocking images have also emerged of flooding on the inside of Midleton hospital which has suffered significant damage. The town has been badly affected by power outages, with the ESB confirming that almost 1,000 properties are without electricity. In Youghal, a boundary wall in the Chestnut Drive housing estate acted like a burst dam as a huge buildup of water caused it to collapse, resulting in flood water flowing into the estate. Locals reported that water gushed through their homes, destroying furniture and floors. Strong waves destroyed a section of the sea wall between Kinsalebeg and Youghal, and the sea spilt out onto roads in the area, causing extreme traffic disruption. Similarly, housing estates in Glanmire, including Copper Valley, Meadowbrook, and Rivergrove were flooded, and roads in the area were forced to close. The force of the fast-moving floods also completely washed away the road between Cloyne and Ladysbridge. Irish Rail cancelled services between CorkCobh and CorkMidleton due to flooding on the lines. Schools in the city and county were closed, and many workers driving to their employment were unable to get there because of flooded and dangerous road conditions. Cllr Frank O'Flynn, Cork County Mayor, pleaded with people to stay safe. He said: I am especially conscious of the advanced preparations that were undertaken by Cork County Council in mitigating the effects of this event and how, despite every effort, homes, businesses and road users have been impacted. Areas where flood defence schemes have been completed fared far better than others in the face of this deluge. I know from speaking with Council staff that some of the issues they are dealing with are unprecedented, with roads which have never flooded now underwater. I am calling on the people of Cork to please avoid unnecessary travel, take extreme care if you must set off on a journey, and please think of vulnerable road users, especially pedestrians and cyclists. As a Council, we will continue to work across the county, both in a preventative capacity while also dealing with issues as they arise. The results of this weather event will be long felt as we move toward a clean-up phase, but can I please reiterate the importance of staying safe and together we will come through this weather event. Senator Tim Lombard urgently called for emergency funding to be put in place to help local authorities deal with these increased costs to repair road infrastructure and to expand the Humanitarian Assistance Fund to include Southern coastal counties impacted by the storm. He said: Local communities left heavily flood-damaged from Storm Babet's torrential rainfall should have access to immediate emergency funding from separate Government departments. There has been unprecedented damage to homes, businesses, and roads across the southern coastal counties, resulting in serious issues for Southern communities who now need help to repair infrastructure and property. There has been at least 115mm of rain in the last 24 hours, which is the equivalent of one month's rainfall. People have been forced to evacuate their homes, cars have been destroyed, and roads have been made completely impassable. When events like this occur, we need to help in any and every way we can. The stress which families are now under should not be underestimated. It is important an initial assessment of the damage is carried out without delay and an action plan is soon put in place to deal with this damage, particularly with regard to properties, businesses and roads. Cork County Council's Roads Directorate is responsible for the maintenance of the largest road network (12,200 km) of any local authority in the country. The local authority will be under pressure to repair roads across the county, so it is essential that there is emergency funding provided. The local authority needs support in helping those affected, and the most straightforward way of doing this is through the Humanitarian Assistance Fund, which would provide urgent funding to small businesses, sports clubs, community, and voluntary organisations who, through no fault of their own, could not secure flood insurance and have premises that have been damaged by the exceptional weather. A Status Orange rain warning remains in effect for two counties, Wicklow and Wexford, until 8pm tonight as the storm tracks eastwards. Met Eireann said spells of heavy rain and blustery east-to-southeast winds may lead to localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The Israeli attack sparked global condemnation and angry protests around the Muslim world. In the meanwhile US President Joe Biden who is in Israel, pledged solidarity with Tel Aviv in its war against Hamas and backed its account that a blast that killed huge numbers of Palestinians at a Gaza hospital had been caused by Palestinian fighters. Gaza death toll reaches 3,478: Health Ministry At least 3,478 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip since fighting between Hamas and Israel began on October 7, says Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra. Another 12,065 Palestinians have been injured, with 70 percent of the victims being women, children, and the elderly, the ministry said. At least 1,300 others also remain missing under the rubble, including 600 children. Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said: I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I have seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But there is a lot of people out there not sure, so we have got a lot, we have got to overcome a lot of things, Biden added. The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does, and other democracies, and they are looking to see what we are going to do. Palestinian officials said an Israeli air strike hit the hospital, with the Palestinian Authority's health minister accusing Israel of causing a massacre. The catastrophe has inflamed the region. Palestinian ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said rescuers were still pulling bodies from the rubble. Al Jazeera carried footage showing a frantic scene as rescue workers scoured blood-stained debris for survivors. Rescuers and civilians were shown carrying away multiple victims in body bags. A Gaza civil defence chief gave a death toll of 300, while health ministry sources put it at 500. Biden's complex diplomatic mission to the Middle East was supposed to calm the region and shore up humanitarian efforts for Gaza, but after the strike, Jordan cancelled a planned summit with the US president, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Abbas also cancelled plans to meet Biden, as Palestinian security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse anti-government protesters in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah as popular anger boiled. Protests also took place at Israel's embassies in Turkey and Jordan and near the US embassy in Lebanon, where security forces fired tear gas toward demonstrators. Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that a strike on a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians was a shocking crime, adding that Israel should provide satellite images to prove that it was not involved in the attack. The Israeli military urged Gaza City residents to relocate southward on Wednesday, saying there was a humanitarian zone with aid available in Al-Mawasi, 28 km (17 miles) down the coast of the Palestinian enclave. The IDF calls on GazaCity residents to evacuate south for their protection, said a social-media post by the military. Speaking to reporters as Biden flew to Tel Aviv, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Biden would put tough questions to Israeli leaders but did not give details. Biden will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet seeking to get a sense of Israel's plans and aims, Kirby said. He also aims to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, where millions of Palestinians are surviving with scant food, fuel and water due to Israel's siege. He will be asking some tough questions, he will be asking them as a friend, as a true friend of Israel, but he will be asking some questions of them, Kirby said. It was unclear what Biden could accomplish during his visit. Kirby said the US president planned to speak with Abbas and Sisi on his way back to Washington. This sort of murky but horrific event makes diplomacy harder and increases escalation risks, said Richard Gowan, UN director at International Crisis Group. Biden has previously said the United States does not want the conflict to flare up into a wider war. Iran has warned Israel of escalation if it failed to end aggressions against Palestinians. The US State Department told Americans not to travel to Lebanon after exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon's south. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified by hundreds of people killed in Tuesday's strike on the hospital. Guterres appealed to Hamas for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and to Israel to allow immediate unrestricted access to humanitarian aid for Gaza. WHO says it has no supplies or equipment left in Gaza warehouse The World Health Organisation has said it has no supplies or equipment left at its Gaza warehouse and hospitals were relying on their last reserve of supplies. In a post on X, it said four out of 35 hospitals were not functioning. Health workers are having to make impossible choices to ration what little they have left in supplies, incl. operating without anaesthetics, WHO said. 'Nobody knows': Palestine Red Crescent Society chief on Gaza aid The director general of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Marwan Jilani, has said nobody knows whether humanitarian assistance would get into the besieged Gaza Strip. There are preparations, yes, he told Al Jazeera when asked about the aid deliveries. We are getting ready so that whenever this border crossing opens, we will be using this opportunity to get critical relief for the people inside Gaza, especially for the patients, the hospitals, and the people at large, Jilani added. UN Security Council has 'not fulfilled its responsibility' in Gaza: Erdogan Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has criticised the United Nations Security Council for its failure to pass a resolution in favour of a pause in Israeli forces' continued attacks on Gaza so that aid could reach civilians. In a post on X, Erdogan said Turkish efforts to establish calm in the region had been hindered by the wholesale punishment being given to the Palestinians, cutting off aid supply as well as the deployment of US aircraft carriers in the region. The United Nations Security Council, which has become even more ineffective, has once again not fulfilled its responsibility, Erdogan said. Western countries, which leave no stone unturned when it comes to human rights and freedoms, have taken no steps other than adding fuel to the fire, he added. Bahraini police crackdown on pro-Palestine protest Bahraini police appear to have cracked down on a small demonstration in Manama in support of Palestinians in Gaza, a video on X (formerly Twitter) posted by the Bahrain Center for Human Rights shows. The handful of activists gathered in front of the cordoned-off Israeli embassy were calling for Bahrain to break off diplomatic ties with Israel and to expel its ambassador, the rights group said. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Beirut sprayed with water cannon, teargas Lebanese security forces used teargas and water cannon to repel scores of protesters demonstrating near the US embassy in Beirut against Israel's attack on a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians, Reuters reports.

Some protesters waved Palestinian flags while others hurled stones at the security forces, who pushed them back with water cannon and volleys of teargas. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators in The Hague urge ICC action Several hundred pro-Palestinian protesters gathered outside The Hague headquarters of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to urge it and the international community to take action against what they call genocide against Palestinians, Reuters reports.

We came here to say enough is enough, Rafat Alkayyali, 50, said, adding that he came to the ICC to protest because he believes in international law. Protesters carried signs that said: Justice for Palestine -- Stop the Genocide and How many children will die until Israel is prosecuted.

The Gulf kingdom's embassy in Beirut said it was closely following the developments in southern Lebanon, where at least 18 people have been killed in exchanges of fire between Hezbollah fighters and Israel. After a rocket strike on a Gaza hospital killed hundreds on Tuesday, Hezbollah called for a day of rage. Hundreds of Hezbollah supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs to protest the strike. The Saudi embassy statement said citizens remaining in Lebanon should exercise caution and stay away from places where gatherings or demonstrations are taking place. Kuwait this week also warned its citizens against travelling to Lebanon. UN relief chief, Egyptian FM discuss aid access to Gaza United Nations relief chief Martin Griffiths held a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry to discuss the dire need for humanitarian conditions in Gaza and aid access to the Palestinian people. French court rules pro-Palestinian protests should be banned case by case France's highest administrative court has said pro-Palestinian protests must be banned on a case-by-case basis, while upholding the validity of an instruction from the French interior minister banning all pro-Palestinian protests. In a note sent to regional police authorities, dated Oct 12, the interior minister had ordered that pro-Palestinian protests, because they are likely to generate disturbances to public order, must be banned, Reuters reports. The appeal on the blanket ban instruction was brought by the organisation Comite Action Palestine, arguing that a total and absolute ban is not justified and encroaches on freedom of expression and assembly. The Conseil d'Etat upheld the validity of the note but said that local authorities could not ban a protest based solely on the note or the fact that a protest is in support of Palestinians. 'Imagery, intercepts' show Israel not behind Gaza strike: White House US intelligence based on aerial images and intercepted communications shows Israel was not to blame for a strike on a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds, the White House has said.

In light of (US) President (Joe) Biden's demand, Israel would not foil the supply of humanitarian aid via Egypt, AFP reports quoting the prime minister's office as saying. The statement noted that aid to civilians in the southern Gaza Strip would be allowed so long as these supplies do not reach Hamas. Saudi FM meets Iranian counterpart, discusses current military escalation in Gaza Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan held a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian on the sidelines of a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah, where they discussed the current military escalation in Gaza and surrounding areas, the Kingdom's foreign ministry said on X.

US vetoes UN Security Council resolution calling for humanitarian pause in conflict The United States has vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict between Israel and the Hamas group to allow humanitarian aid access to the Gaza Strip, Reuters reports. The vote on the Brazilian-drafted text was twice delayed in the past couple of days as the United States tries to broker aid access to Gaza. Twelve members voted in favour of the draft text on Wednesday, while Russia and Britain abstained. Washington traditionally shields its ally Israel from any Security Council action. The draft resolution urged Israel -- without naming it -- to rescind its order for civilians and UN staff in Gaza to move to the south of the Palestinian enclave. Israeli troops kill two Palestinian teens in West Bank amid Gaza anger Israeli forces have shot dead two Palestinian teenagers near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank after protests against Israel's bombing of the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian health ministry said. The deaths brought the toll of Palestinians killed in the latest flare-up of Israeli-Palestinian violence to at least 64 in the West Bank. A statement from the Palestinian Authority's health ministry said Israeli forces shot a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old in the village of Shuqba west of Ramallah. It did not elaborate. Residents told Reuters that the two boys were trying to light tyres in protest against Israel when they were shot.

Biden administration staffers feel 'stifled' discussing horrors in Gaza: report Several US officials have said they feel stifled about having a full debate on what is happening in Gaza, particularly Israeli restraint on Palestinians, according to a HuffPost report. Staffers of the Bident administration, most of whom work on national security issues, told the news outlet that they and their colleagues worry about retaliation at work for questioning Israel's conduct amid the US-backed Israeli campaign on Gaza after the Oct 7 Hamas attack. HuffPost said the fear was especially intense among officials with Muslim backgrounds. On Sunday, presidential personnel office chief Gautam Raghavan organised a call with close to a dozen current and former high-level Muslim appointees to discuss their concerns. Some staffers said they felt unsafe voicing their opinions around colleagues, according to a person on the call, which has not been previously reported, the report said. A career civil servant described the tension between their commitment to challenging rights abuses and their job. Meanwhile, the report said White House officials are planning to hold a listening session with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian staff to hear from them directly in the coming days.

Germany's Scholz vows action after Molotovs thrown at Berlin synagogue German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has vowed to fight anti-Semitism on German soil after attackers hurled two Molotov cocktails at a Jewish synagogue in Berlin early today. Police in the German capital said they are probing the attack in the Mitte district of the city. There are no reports of injuries or damage. The attack, at around 3:45am, comes amid a sharp increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the wake of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Two unidentified people came on foot and threw two burning bottles filled with liquid in the direction of the synagogue on Brunnenstrasse, a commercial and residential street, police said in a statement.

EU 'cannot accept' Israel illegally halting water to Gaza: Borrell The European Union cannot accept Israel stopping water supplies to Gaza's population, which clearly violates international law, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said. Suspending the water supply to a community under siege is contrary to international law. But we cannot accept that, he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, AFP reports. That was the EU's position when it came to Ukraine, where Russian forces besieged communities and cut off water, and it should be the same when it came to Gaza, he added. It is clearly stated that depriving a human community under siege of a basic water supply is contrary to international law -- in Ukraine and in Gaza. And if we are unable to say so, for both places, we lack the moral authority necessary to make our voice heard, Borrell said. The World Health Organisation has urged against any attacks on healthcare centres, a day after a Gaza hospital strike that killed almost 500 people. We call... at a minimum to stop any attacks on healthcare facilities, the head of the who is European branch, Hans Kluge, told AFP in an interview.

'Help us, help us!': A doctor's account of the hospital attack The scenes of destruction from the hospital were horrific even by the standards of the past 12 days, which have confronted the world with relentless images, first of Israelis slaughtered in their homes and then of Palestinian families buried under rubble from Israel's retaliatory strikes. People came running into the surgery department screaming, 'Help us, help us, there are people killed and wounded inside the hospital!' said Dr Fadel Naim, Head of the hospital's Orthopedic Surgery Department. The hospital was full of dead and wounded, dismembered bodies, and dead, he told Reuters. We tried to save whoever can be saved but the number was too big for the hospital team to be able to save... We saw them alive but we could not help them and they were martyred. This place created a safe haven for women and children, those who escaped the Israeli bombing, another doctor at the hospital, Ibrahim Al-Naqa, told Reuters. We do not know what the she will is called but we saw the results of it when it targeted children and ripped their bodies into pieces.

Turkish police detained five protesters for attempting to sneak into the Israeli consulate in Istanbul, the governor's office said. Providing aid to Gaza a matter of 'life or death': UN relief chief Providing aid to the people of Gaza -- wherever they are -- is a matter of life or death, said United Nations Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths.

Iran calls for Islamic countries to sanction Israel Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) should sanction and implement an oil embargo on Israel, in addition to expelling Israeli ambassadors, a statement issued by Iran's foreign ministry quotes Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian as saying. An urgent meeting of the OIC, co-convened by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, is under way in Jeddah for Islamic countries to discuss the Israeli-Hamas conflict. Egypt 'did not close' Gaza crossing to aid, Sisi says President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Egypt did not close the only border crossing with Gaza not under Israel's control, blaming Israeli bombardments for it not operating, AFP reports. Developments on the ground and the repeated bombings by Israel of the Palestinian side of the crossing have prevented operations, Sisi told reporters. Aid convoys have been waiting for six days on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, which has been bombed four times by Israel since the Oct 7 Hamas blitz. Biden backs Israel account of Gaza hospital strike US President Joe Biden, who is on a solidarity visit to Israel, has backed the ally's account that Palestinian fighters caused a devastating hospital strike in Gaza, AFP reports. I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what I have seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you, Biden said as he opened a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. But there is a lot of people out there not sure so we have to overcome a lot of things, the US president said. Biden added that he is encouraging Netanyahu to ensure life-saving capacity to help the Palestinians who are innocent and caught in the middle of this. World reacts to air strike on Gaza hospital killing hundreds A strike resulted in the deaths of at least 500 Palestinians at the crowded Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to the health ministry in the besieged enclave. The strike, which Palestinian officials said came from Israel, was denied by Tel Aviv. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instead blamed barbaric terrorists for the attack. US President Joe Biden said in his official statement that he was outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was horrified by the loss of life at Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, he said in a post on his official X account. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified after the deaths of hundreds of people in a strike on a hospital in Gaza. My heart is with the families of the victims. Hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law, he said in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. In another post, he called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Middle East to ease the epic human suffering. Too many lives -- and the fate of the entire region -- hang in the balance, Guterres said. PM Kakar says Israel must be held accountable for 'war crimes' Reacting to the strike which killed hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar demanded that Israel be held accountable for its war crimes. Targeting a hospital, a sanctuary for those in need, is an indefensible act of inhumanity. International humanitarian law give protection to hospitals and medical personnel, he said. He demanded an end to indiscriminate targeting and urged the international community to act swiftly to stop the violence and hold those accountable responsible. Kakar, who is in Beijing for the third Belt and Road Forum, also mentioned interacting with the UN secretary general. I urged him that global community should ask Israel to stop killing innocent Palestinians, he said. In a subsequent post, he said that Israel must be held accountable for its war crimes as it continues its unrelenting bombardment and siege of Gaza that has resulted in death, destruction and displacement. The backers of Israeli occupation need to reconsider their policies which provide impunity to Israeli authorities in carrying out their campaign of terror against the people of Gaza, he said. PM Kakar discusses situation in Gaza with UN chief in Beijing Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar discussed the situation in Gaza with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Beijing. According to a statement released by the PM's Office, Kakar urged UN to play its role in stopping Israeli atrocities against the oppressed Palestinians. European Union (EU) chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday there is no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians in Gaza, AFP reports. The European Commission president told EU lawmakers the facts need to be established on the overnight strike on the Gaza hospital. Von der Leyen said all those responsible must be held accountable. European Council President Charles Michel posted on social media that there was no conceivable reason to strike a facility with innocent civilians and medical staff and said such an attack is not in line with international law. Modi 'shocked' at hospital attack, calls for accountability Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he is deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. In a post on X, he said: Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured. Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible. Pakistani NGOs beset by 'visa denials' in quest to help Gazans As the humanitarian situation in Gaza becomes desperate after days of relentless bombing by Israeli forces, global aid organisations have said the time was running out to save millions of people in the Gaza Strip. Yet, no aid is being allowed inside the besieged enclave. Like global aid agencies, non-governmental organisations in Pakistan are also ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians, but they cite blockade and logistical issues as key challenges. All routes to Gaza are closed. It is all sealed, Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Foundation told Dawn, adding his heart bleeds for the Palestinians. UK university suspends students over Gaza rally Students from the Palestine Society at SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies) have said the university had suspended students following a rally in solidarity with Gaza. The SOAS Palestine Society posted to X saying, URGENT: SOAS University of London, renowned for its so called progressive politics, has officially begun taking steps suspending its own students following a rally in solidarity with Gaza. This is a clear act of political repression. Please read on and share widely.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis visited the site of the crash on Wednesday morning and offered his condolences to the loved ones of the semi-truck driver, who was later identified as Lafollette Henderson, 60, from Compton, California. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed on his truck as it passed underneath. Based on the preliminary investigation, a broken rail east of the I-25 bridge likely caused the train, which was carrying coal, to derail and the bridge to collapse. No other vehicles on the road were involved. About a half dozen train cars were scattered across both lanes of I-25. A total of 30 cars derailed. Polis said the closed section of the southbound lanes was repaved on Wednesday and will open in the afternoon hours. It officially reopened around 2:15 p.m. On the northbound side, crews with the Colorado Department of Transportation expect to open the lanes before Thursday evening. Broken rail caused Pueblo train derailment that collapsed bridge, NTSB says Our top priority is to get the highway back open so that people can continue traveling safely between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, and the rest of the state, Polis said. Though the investigation is still ongoing, it remains clear that investments in rail are needed now more than ever and Colorado has been working for months to take advantage of historic safety and rail funding from the federal government. The damaged roadway will be milled, so drivers may notice the road is rough in the area. The speed limit will be temporarily lowered as well. We appreciate the all hands on deck approach to getting this work done quickly, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway taking the lead on rebuilding the bridge safely and efficiently, said CDOT Director Shoshana Lew.

Former Vice President Mike Pence is having an unusually quiet week on the trail after filing a finance report showing his campaign facing money troubles. The usually busy Pence campaign's only public event this week was a pre-planned Tuesday Newsmax town hall in Windsor Heights, Iowa . Pence is not planning to attend Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks' MMM Tailgate in Iowa City Friday -- where much of the rest of the 2024 GOP presidential field will appear, including former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Instead, the Pence campaign says he will be in Dallas for private fundraisers and a Republican National Committee event. Pence's campaign reported only 1.2 million in the bank after the third quarter -- not all of which can even be spent in the 2024 primary. The campaign is already carrying 620,000 in debt, and Pence himself chipped in 150,000 of his own personal money to keep things going in the third quarter. That puts a serious strain on the day-to-day operations of the campaign -- and what is more, Pence also faces a sprint to amass the 70,000 unique donors needed to qualify for the November 8 GOP presidential debate.

North Korea appears to have begun secretly shipping large amounts of munitions to Russia, according to a new report, using ships and trains to move the weaponry and bolster Moscow's war against Ukraine. The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Ghaziabad, Oct 18 (PTI) India's first semi-high-speed regional rail service -- RAPIDX -- whose trains are equipped with hi-tech features and a number of passenger amenities, is all set for its inaugural run on October 21, a day after the inauguration of the 17-km priority section of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS Corridor. The priority section, between Sahibabad and Duhai Depot, has five stations -- Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai Depot. The segment from Duhai to Duhai Depot is a spur from the main corridor. Also Read  Manipur: NHRC Registered 18 Human Rights Violations Cases During Violence in State. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the priority section at the Sahibabad RAPIDX station in Uttar Pradesh on Friday. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Wednesday said he will flag off a RAPIDX train connecting Sahibabad and Duhai Depot stations, marking the launch of the RRTS in India. Also Read  Hyderabad Shocker: Five-Year-Old Girl Raped, Murdered by Migrant Worker From Bihar in Bhanur, Arrested. The foundation stone for the RRTS Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Corridor was laid by him on March 8, 2019. A media preview of the RAPIDX trains was held on Wednesday ahead of the inauguration of the priority section. A day after the inauguration of the priority section, passenger services will begin from October 21 morning. RAPIDX trains will be operational between 6 am and 11 pm. Initially, trains will be available every 15 minutes, though the frequency can be increased on a requirement basis in the future, an official source told PTI on Tuesday. Every RAPIDX train will have six coaches, including a premium coach. One coach in every train is reserved for women and it is the coach next to the premium coach. Seats in coaches are serially numbered Also, there are reserved seats for women, specially-abled, and senior citizens in other coaches, the officials said. Premium coaches have a seat with a different colour code, a provision for installing a vending machine in future, besides a host of additional commuter-centric features like reclining seats, coat hooks, magazine holders and footrests, officials said on Wednesday. The soon-to-open section of the RRTS Delhi-Meerut Corridor will also facilitate the movement of patients as one general coach in each train will have the space to accommodate a medical stretcher and a wheelchair. Besides, some of the lifts installed at its stations are elongated for extra room to accommodate a stretcher, officials of the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) said. CCTV cameras, an emergency door-opening mechanism and a button to communicate with a train operator are among the safety features in trains that will ply on this section from October 21. For enhanced safety, every RRTS station is equipped with platform screen doors (PSDs). These PSDs are integrated with RRTS train doors and the signalling system. On Wednesday, during the media preview, trains were run on the priority section at a speed up to 130-140 kmph. Speed and station names are displayed on screens installed inside coaches. Trains can operate on this corridor even up to a speed of 160 kmph, but the operational speed will be lesser, a senior official said. A push-button facility on the doors of the trains will allow passengers to board and get off the train when it halts at a station, officials said. This step has been taken as a measure to save energy, they said, adding that the push-button only gets activated after a train comes to a halt at a station. However, initially, the door operation in coaches will be done automatically, and train attendants and ground staff will assist passengers till they fully get used to this system, officials said. Once the corridor gets operationalised, people can commute between Sahibabad and Duhai Depot stations on this line in about 12 minutes, they said. A one-way journey from Sahibabad to Duhai Depot station on the priority section of this RRTS Corridor will cost Rs 50, while the fare for the same route will be Rs 100 in a premium-class coach. If a passenger enters from one station, say Sahibabad station and exits from the same station, then it will cost Rs 20. Children having a height below 90 cm will be allowed to travel free, the NCRTC said. Commuters can buy a paper QR code-based ticket, which can be generated via ticket vending machines (TVM) or bought from ticket counters at the RAPIDX stations, officials said. Unified Payments Interface or UPI-enabled ticket vending machines have been installed to purchase paper QR code-based tickets and recharge the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC). Passengers can use bank notes, bank cards, National Common Mobility Cards and UPI to buy tickets from a TVM, they said. The under-construction RRTS Corridor, being built for a semi-high-speed regional rail service named 'RAPIDX' by the NCRTC, is a joint venture company of the Centre with the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The NCRTC has been tasked to oversee the construction of India's first RRTS, between Delhi and Meerut. The government of Uttar Pradesh has entrusted the responsibility of security of all the stations in the state to the Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force (UPSSF) and the deployment of security force at the stations of the priority section has already been done, another senior official said. The NCRTC has been tasked to oversee the construction of India's first RRTS, between Delhi and Meerut. The entire 82.15 km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS is targeted to be operational by June 2025. The RRTS corridor, once fully operational would cut down the travel time between Delhi and Meerut to around 55 minutes from the current three to four hours by road.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Several landmark studies have been published in the last year highlighting the link between chemical hair relaxers -- which break down proteins in hair to straighten it -- and increased rates of uterine cancer. And last week, after pressure from Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Shontel Brown of Ohio, the Food and Drug Administration said it would propose a ban on hair-smoothing and hair-straightening products containing formaldehyde, an ingredient known to cause cancer. As more research continues to reveal potential dangers, hundreds of Black people have filed lawsuits against big-name beauty and cosmetic retailers like L'Oreal and Revlon, blaming their chemical hair straighteners as causes of uterine cancer, fibroid tumors and infertility. The latest research on the effects of hair relaxers was published October 10 by Boston University. According to the Black Women's Health Study, or BWHS, postmenopausal Black women who have used chemical hair relaxers more than twice a year or for more than five years have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. In following 44,798 Black women for up to 22 years, researchers found a higher rate of uterine cancer among postmenopausal Black women who reported having used chemical hair relaxers for at least 10 years, regardless of frequency. Better grasping Black health and the factors that contribute to racial disparities in cancer was the intent behind the 22-year study. The idea here is that a renewed emphasis or attention to the potential dangers of these products, I hope, will spur policies, and that will sort of help reduce exposure in this population or even help us identify potentially safer alternatives to straighten hair, said the lead author of the study, Kimberly Bertrand, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University Chobanian  Avedisian School of Medicine. Revealing the potential risks of hair relaxers, she said, can help spread awareness and encourage making safer choices. NBC News spoke to Bertrand and other researchers to answer some questions Black people may have about chemical hair straighteners and the potential risks to their health Several studies have found that chemical hair straighteners have harmful effects on the body. Last year, the National Institutes of Health published a major study linking chemical hair straighteners to a higher risk of uterine cancer. The study analyzed data from 33,497 YOU.S. women ages 35 to 74 who were followed for nearly 11 years. During that period, 378 cases of uterine cancer were diagnosed. According to this month's BWHS, women who reported using hair relaxers more than twice a year or who used them for more than five years had a greater than 50 risk of developing uterine cancer compared to those who rarely or never used relaxers, additional data from the study shows. In 2021, the BWHS found that Black women who used hair products containing lye, an ingredient typically found in salon relaxers, at least seven times a year for more than 15 years had a 30 increased risk of developing breast cancer. Among the 50,543 women who participated in the 25-year study, 2,311 participants had developed breast cancer, including 1,843 who developed invasive breast cancers, meaning the cancers spread into surrounding breast tissue. While Black women have a 4 lower incidence rate of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a 40 higher breast cancer death rate, according to the American Cancer Society. Other studies have shown that hair relaxers can cause fibroids and an early onset of puberty in girls, Bertrand said. Early puberty can increase the risk for metabolic syndromes such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Chemical hair relaxers contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can disrupt the functions of the endocrine system (which includes the thyroid, ovaries, pancreas and adrenal glands) and affect hormone levels. These chemicals include phthalates and parabens, which can be found in relaxers. People can be exposed to them by absorption through the skin or inhaling them in the air. Black women are often exposed to endocrine disruptors by using relaxers, which are applied on the scalp, said Jasmine Abrams, a research scientist at the Yale University School of Public Health. If you have ever gotten a relaxer, you know it usually sits on for a little bit, and most people sort of alert their hair stylist that it needs to be washed out once it starts tingling or burning -- and at that point, you are running the risk of burns, said Abrams, one of the authors of a study this year linking chemical hair straighteners to issues with fertility. And if you are running the risk of burns or any sort of injury with that type of chemical, then you are definitely increasing your risk for absorption. If you do that over time for many, many years, then it can, of course, become continuously problematic. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can also be found in some beauty products like lotions, body washes and perfumes, she added. Parabens, phthalates and other chemicals that are often found in chemical hair straighteners pose a greater risk than other products because of scalp exposure, Bertrand said. Even other chemical hair straighteners marketed as safer to use, including no-lye relaxers, still pose potential risks. In our study, women who reported using non-lye relaxers were pretty much just as likely to report scalp burns as those who use lye relaxer, she said. Hair-straightening products are very poorly regulated by the federal government, Bertrand said, and many mask harmful chemicals under names such as fragrance and preservatives, so women do not really know what they are being exposed to. YOU.S. law does not require the Food and Drug Administration to approve cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives, before they go on the market, according to the FDA website. However, the FDA announced last week that it would propose a ban on hair-straightening and hair-smoothing products containing formaldehyde. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stricter regulations of ingredients in cosmetic products and using alternative methods like heat straightening may help reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, Bertrand said. Researchers are not entirely sure. We cannot definitively say that occasional use is entirely safe, said Abrams, an author of the 2023 study about hair relaxers and infertility. Our data essentially suggests that less frequent use is associated with lower risks when compared to regular prolonged use. In Abrams' study -- which included women of different races ages 21 to 45 -- Black women accounted for the greatest population of people who had started using relaxers at age 10 or younger. More than 50 of the Black participants in the study also had used hair relaxers before they reached age 10. Bertrand's study found that postmenopausal Black women had a greater risk of developing uterine cancer if they used hair relaxers more than twice a year or consistently for more than five years. Other factors put Black women at risk for developing uterine cancer, including age, obesity and family and reproductive history, Bertrand added. There are no proven screening mechanisms to detect uterine cancer in the general population, as there are with other diseases like breast cancer, Bertrand said. Women should visit their doctors if they have any symptoms of pain in the pelvic area or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Those with family histories of uterine cancer can also speak to their doctors about genetic testing to identify potential higher risks for certain cancers. In terms of monitoring reproductive health, Abrams said, women can monitor their hormone levels -- either by visiting endocrinologists or mailing in their biospecimens to labs -- and speak with gynecologists about their concerns and ask about taking fertility assessments. In working on an upcoming study on Black women and infertility, she said, many of her participants have described challenges in getting treatment or being heard by their health providers. One of our participants said, 'I felt like the goal among providers has always been to figure out how to keep Black women from getting pregnant, not to help them figure out how to get pregnant,' Abrams said. So she felt like, when she expressed these concerns about her fertility to her provider, she was not taken seriously. Many Black women have consulted with attorneys to sue Revlon, Just for Me and other cosmetics companies, alleging their hair straighteners because cancer, fibroids and other health problems. Strength of Nature, LLC, which owns Just for Me, declined to comment. Larry Taylor Jr., an attorney at The Cochran Firm in Dallas, said thousands of women from their 20s to their 50s have filed suits alleging they developed ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers from using hair relaxers. Revlon declined to comment. Robert Britton, an attorney for the company, said earlier this year that Revlon disputes any link between cancer and its hair relaxer products. Thousands of Black women have also claimed that hair relaxers from L'Oreal were harmful to their health, including a group of Black women who sued L'Oreal and other companies last year. One woman, Bernadette Gordon, who used hair relaxers from 1983 to 2015, experienced uterine and breast cancer resulting in a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy, she previously told NBC News. In July, L'Oreal asked a federal court to dismiss the dozens of consolidated lawsuits against the company, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims were vague and based on unsupported conclusions. The company did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Many Black women straighten their hair to keep their jobs or advance to higher positions, which puts them at risk, Taylor said. This is not a hoax, he said. This is something that is actually harmful and could potentially cost them their lives. Still, there are many unknowns researchers are trying to uncover, including whether the products on the shelves today are going to lead to cases of uterine cancer in the future, Bertrand said. It is also not entirely clear why Black women are at an increased risk of developing and dying from uterine cancer. We continue to explore those factors -- everything from environment to racism to genetics, she said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The vague language was toughed up later in the day after questions from the media, with Mr Biden saying that his comments backing the Israeli military's assertion that militants in Gaza were responsible for the attack were based on data from my Defense Department. During a final speech before heading back to Washington, the president said it appears the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. The dispute over the source of the explosion on Tuesday evening hung heavily over Biden's visit. Before he arrived, Israeli's military released a flurry of video, audio, and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas. Officials in Gaza have blamed Israel for the blast, claiming that 471 people were killed and 341 wounded. A spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry called it an Israeli massacre. Nations such as Jordan, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey lined to blame Israel for the blast causing the cancellation of what would have been a second leg of Mr Biden's trip, to Jordan, to discuss the situation in Gaza with King Abdullah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. The hospital explosion also became a lightning rod for anger across the Middle East, with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group calling for a day of rage on Wednesday, with protests in the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Iran and elsewhere. That left Mr Biden's trip focused on Israel. Having been hugged on the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after landing in Tel Aviv, he ended his trip saying that US will stand forever with Israel will not let you ever be alone. Speaking about the Hamas attack across the border 11 days ago that left around 1,400 people dead and almost 200 hostages believed to be taken by the militants back into Gaza, Mr Biden said it had left a deep, deep wound. Referencing the Holocaust in the Second World War he said the world did nothing but that we will not stand by and do nothing again. He went on to also reference the terror attacks of 911 saying for a nation the size of Israel the Hamas attack was like 15 911s. He said he would ask Congress for an unprecedented aid package for Israel this week to help in its defence. In the wake of the Hamas attack, Israel has launched a near-continuous aerial bombardment of Gaza and a complete siege of the enclave leaving aid unable to get in. The military also called on Palestinians in the enclave of more than two million people to move to southern Gaza ahead of what is expected to be a ground operation, leaving hospitals and shelters overcrowded. That is an evacuation order which rights groups and the UN argue could amount to the war crime of forcible transfer. Mr Biden said that you cannot look at what has happened in Israel and not scream out for justice. but he said that Palestinians in Gaza were also suffering and that while you feel that rage, do not be consumed by it. Earlier this week, the US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, had been working to try and ensure that humanitarian aid would be able to enter Gaza from the border with Egypt, which has been stuck for days. Mr Biden said he had secured a deal for Israel to allow such aid as long as it was inspected before crossing into Gaza, while also announcing 100 million (82m) in humanitarian assistance to help Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. After Mr Biden's remarks, Mr Netanyahu's office said that in light of President Biden's demand Israel will not thwart humanitarian supplies from Egypt as long as it is only food, water and medicine for the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip. The statement did not mention fuel, which is badly needed for power as supplies are dwindling, while there was no timings given for when aid might begin to move into the Strip. The state of the crisis in Gaza is illustrated by the fact patients are being operated on without anaesthetic. Doctors are having to make impossible choices the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned, as it announced its own warehouse of medicine in the strip is now completely empty. Local and general anaesthetics across the strip are on the brink of running out completely, while blood banks only have two weeks of supply left, according to WHO officials. The warnings of failing supplies come amid concerns for those wounded in the hospital blast on Tuesday. The Independent was sent videos showing paramedics tending to the wounded in pools of blood on the floor. Mohamed Ghanem, an emergency doctor at Gaza's largest hospital al-Shifaa, said: There was no operation room any more because of the mass casualties. The doctors tried to do surgeries in the corridors of the hospital without any anaesthesia. Part of the reason for Mr Biden's trip was to try and ensure Israel's war does not spiral into a broader conflict. given the continuing clashes between Israel's military and Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon. Face-to-face time with Arab leaders by Mr Biden was supposed to work on containing the damage, but Mr Biden was unable to achieve that on this trip. The size of the task ahead was also made clear by Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan as he slammed the United Nations Security Council for being unable to pass a non-binding resolution for a humanitarian pause in the conflict between Palestinian and Israeli forces to allow aid to reach civilians in Gaza. In a post on social media platform X, formally known as Twitter, Mr Erdogan said Turkish efforts to establish calm in the region had been hindered by the collective punishment of Palestinians through air strikes and the deployment of US aircraft carriers to the region. The United Nations Security Council, which has become even more ineffective, has once again not fulfilled its responsibility, Erdogan said. As for the UK, Rishi Sunak has called for a calm and cool response to the blast at the Gaza hospital as the government committed to publish an assessment of who was behind the blast. The prime minister urged MPs not to rush to judgment. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the Commons: We take note of what President Biden has said, but we will come to our own judgment, we will work on that quickly, and we will ensure that our assessment is put in the public domain as soon as we are confident of the details.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Met Office has taken the step of issuing a rare 'red weather warning' amid concerns that the storm could cause severe damage, possibly even posing a danger to life. Laurencekirk, Montrose and Forfar are among the towns covered by the alert, which comes into effect at 6pm tomorrow and is due to last until 12pm on Friday - with the communities being warned of possible collapsing buildings, road closures, loss of power and extensive flooding. It is the first time a red warning has been issued for rain since Storm Dennis pounded the country in 2020. But just what does a red weather warning mean? A red weather warning is the highest possible alert which can be issued by the Met Office. According to their website it means that 'dangerous weather is expected and, if you have not already done so, you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the severe weather. The Met Office adds: 'It is very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. 'You should avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.' Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly said of Storm Babet: 'Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the red warning. '100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts with flooding likely.' Other parts of the country are facing amber and yellow weather warnings in the wake of the storm. The Met Office describes an amber warning as 'an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans. 'This means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property. You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. 'You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact. Yellow weather warnings are issued when the weather is likely to have a more low-level effect. Many are issued when it is likely that the weather will cause some low level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places,' the Met Office says. 'Many people may be able to continue with their daily routine, but there will be some that will be directly impacted and so it is important to assess if you could be affected. As these are used for a range of weather scenarios, the advice is to 'read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning'. While it is the first red warning issued for rain for some time, there have been a number of red warnings given for other extreme weather events in recent years. A red warning was issued for the South-east and east of England, and south Wales in February 2022 in the wake of Storm Eunice, which brought with it winds of up to 122mph, while 2021's Storm Arwen also led to a red weather warning for wind - covering a large section of the east coast from Aberdeen to Newcastle. However, the most recent red warning was for heat - and it marked the first time the Met Office had issued such an alert for high temperatures. That one, issued in July 2022, covered most of central and Southern England, when the hottest part of the UK reached above 40C for the first time ever.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

PUEBLO, Colo.-- A BNSF coal train traveling near Pueblo on Sunday, October 15 derailed on a bridge that runs over I-25. The train consisted of 124 loaded coal cars and when the derailment of 30 cars occurred, it caused the bridge over which it was traveling to collapse, which landed on a tractor-trailer, killing the driver. The derailment also caused I-25 to be shut down through, as damaged cars and coal were spread all across the interstate. The initial report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a broken rail was probably the because of the derailment. The broken rail was located east of the rail bridge. At this writing, it is not clear who owns the bridge. BNSF told The Colorado Sun that the state of Colorado owns the bridge, but the Colorado Department of Transportation is checking records from when the bridge was built in the 1950s to determine ownership. The Sun reports that Matt Inzeao, who is the Colorado Department of Transportation's communication director, said We have been working through some conflicting information thus far. We do not have access to the maintenance and inspection activity performed by BNSF for the bridge. Other than the death of the truck driver, no injuries were reported.

The regulator said Network Rail is failing to prevent potential safety issues and had no risk-assessed plan for two major crowd crush areas. Passengers waiting on the station's concourse often surge forwards when the platform their train is departing from is announced. The ORR made a visit to the station in September after reviewing CCTV footage of three incidents of concern in the summer. In the footage, which showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels and a lack of crowd control, there were reports of minor injuries and the potential for more serious consequences. The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has now issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Read more: Investigation launched into Flying Scotsman crash Avanti West Coast contract renewed despite 'disastrous' 2022 Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services in the mornings and early evenings can be more expensive and less used than off-peak services, which can result in overcrowding for later trains. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said that managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge. He added: Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. 'Hundreds of people were kettled' Euston was the UK's seventh busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits. At 10.40am, on Sunday 15 October, a points failure at Euston station caused all lines to shut. Network Rail said at the time: We are sorry for the disruption to services in and out of London Euston earlier today while our engineers repaired a fault with the signalling system in the area. In January, passengers called on the Southeastern rail operator to do something as reduced timetables led to hundreds of commuters being diverted to London Bridge - the third busiest station in the UK. Former Greenwich Council leader Danny Thorpe said at a council meeting at the time: Hundreds of people were kettled onto platforms. Things got so bad there was violence, and the police were called to the station. London Bridge saw 33.3 million entries and exists in the year to March 2022, behind Waterloo's 41.4 million and Victoria's 36.7 million.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Severe rainfall and winds are expected to pelt Britain this week, leading to heavy flooding that could put lives at risk in eastern Scotland, Britain's national weather service warned on Wednesday. Fall is typically wet and windy in Scotland, and earlier this month floodwaters submerged streets, damaged railways and swept away unharvested crops. But the red alert on Wednesday -- the highest rain alert issued by the weather agency, the Met Office -- signaled the possible severity of the incoming Storm Babet, and officials urged residents to brace for dangerous conditions beginning on Thursday. As much as a month's worth of rain is expected to fall between Thursday and Friday in Scotland, according to the forecast, with some areas expecting 250 millimeters, or 9.8 inches, of rain. That is more than fell in Scotland in the entire month of October in 2022 -- about 196 millimeters, or 7.7 inches. Torrential rain could flood homes, cut off power and other essential services, and leave communities isolated for several days, the agency said. The fast-flowing and rising floodwaters, it added, could pose a danger to life. The storm will bring heavy rain to Scotland's southwest on Wednesday before moving to the northeast on Thursday and into the weekend, David Morgan, flood duty manager for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, said in a release. With earlier rain already filling rivers and saturating catchments, Mr. Morgan said, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. Winds of more than 70 miles per hour were also likely on Thursday, the weather agency said, especially near Scottish coastlines, which are vulnerable to landslides. The heavy rain and winds will also hit Northern Ireland and England, which have weather warnings in place. Local authorities and residents in Scotland prepared on Wednesday for the worst as Humza Yousaf, the first minister of Scotland, cautioned of challenging weather ahead. Travel should be avoided unless absolutely essential, he said on social media, adding that the government was collaborating with emergency services to try mitigate disruptions. The brunt of the storm is expected to affect the northeastern Scottish regions of Angus and Aberdeenshire, and local officials have cleared gullies and offered sandbags to residents trying to protect their property from floodwater. Network Rail, which oversees Britain's railway infrastructure, advised people living near railways in Scotland to secure tents, trampolines and garden furniture to prevent them from blowing onto tracks. The weather agency last issued the highest extreme rain alert in 2020 during Storm Dennis, which left at least three people dead and submerged streets in parts of England, Wales and Scotland. The storm was one of the most intense to batter the North Atlantic and raised questions about the country's preparedness for intense flooding. While it is difficult to attribute individual weather events directly to climate change, scientists say that a warming planet leads to worsening extreme rainfall in many storms.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The Russian leader, who was on a visit to China, briefed president Xi Jinping in some detail about Ukraine saying that external factors and common threats served only to strengthen Russia-Chinese cooperation. The Kremlin chief said that Washington's decision to supply the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), whose use Kyiv confirmed, just prolongs the agony for Ukraine. Firstly, this of course causes harm and creates an additional threat. Secondly, we will of course be able to repel these attacks. War is war, Vladimir Putin said, adding, But most importantly, it fundamentally lacks the capacity to change the situation on the line of contact at all ... This is another mistake by the United States. Ukraine had repeatedly asked Washington for ATACMS to help it attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory. A mistake of a larger scale, as yet invisible but still of great importance, is that the United States is becoming more and more personally drawn into this conflict. And let no one say that they have nothing to do with this. We believe they do, Vladimir Putin said, noting that the United States had sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean in response to the explosion of violence between Israel and Hamas. The Russian president said that it was good that the West was starting to talk about the need to solve the Ukraine crisis by peaceful means, though he did not cite examples.

In that April report, BNSF analyzed a section of fractured rail following March 2023's fiery derailment that forced evacuations in southwest Minnesota. . . however they have not officially concluded that the broken rail caused the crash. On April 18, the NTSB released a preliminary report on the Minnesota derailment and stated that a train carrying 14 hazardous materials tank cars was traveling north, and at 12:58 a.m. local time, 10 tank cars derailed, hazardous materials were released and contributed to a fire. On Monday, October 16, NTSB Newsroom announced via Twitter that it has opened a docket for its investigation of the March 30, 2023 derailment of a BNSF Railway freight train on the Marshall District in Raymond, Minnesota.

The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately - ATACMS proved themselves, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the US administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Mr Zelensky's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 310km. The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told national television.

The hearing, hosted by the Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee, comes at a critical time in the wake of Hamas' terrorist attack in Israel. President Joe Biden is in the region this week for meetings with Israeli leaders, and Israel is preparing for a potential ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week that the administration is working to get Lew confirmed quickly. Biden nominated him last month. We are going to work with both Democrats and Republicans -- and particularly the leaders on both sides and the chair and ranking member in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- to make that happen as soon as humanly possible and then get him out to the region immediately thereafter, Sullivan said. After the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, the White House began working urgently to kick-start the confirmation process. Congressional recesses and other issues had delayed it. The YOU.S. has not had a Senate-confirmed ambassador to Israel since Thomas Nides left the administration in July. Stephanie Hallett, a career diplomat, has been the top YOU.S. official at the YOU.S. Embassy in the interim. Lew, who is Jewish, has decades of experience in Washington, and he has been active in pro-Israel advocacy circles. He was the White House chief of staff for the last two years of President Barack Obama's first term and then was treasury secretary from 2013 to 2017. His current positions include managing partner at Lindsay Goldberg LLC, visiting professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and co-president of the board of the National Library of Israel USA. Lew, 68, was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Obama and President Bill Clinton. During the Clinton administration, he helped develop the memorandum of understanding on multiyear YOU.S. funding for Israel, and during the Obama administration he worked several times to provide crucial funding for Israel's missile defense systems that are designed to protect residents from attacks, a White House official said recently. At the beginning of his career, Lew was a congressional aide, at one point serving as a senior policy adviser to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last month immediately endorsed Lew after Biden nominated him. It is vital we have a strong American ambassador in Jerusalem. Mr. Lew is precisely the person for the job of ambassador to Israel that we need, Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. Lew is likely to get widespread support from Senate Democrats, but it is unclear how many Republicans he can win over. And while he may not need GOP backing if all 51 members of the Democratic Caucus back him, unanimous bipartisan support would allow for a faster confirmation vote. The Senate could confirm Lew as soon as next week. Even in the face of Republican opposition, Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., hopes Democrats can get cooperation to move quickly on the Senate floor. It is critically important to have a confirmed ambassador, Cardin told NBC News. We are talking about being with Israel, giving them everything they need. Well, we need to have a confirmed ambassador on the ground in Israel to evaluate exactly what they need and be able to get that aid or weapons to Israel. Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel, told reporters he expects there to be some GOP opposition to Lew. I am going to listen with an open mind, Risch said. But I have to tell you, given the things that have happened in the past with him, it is going to be a heavy lift for me. But he is going to have an opportunity Wednesday to persuade people that he is the right guy for the job. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is not a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told NBC News: We should not confirm someone who has been so soft on Iran, repeatedly. ... The Democrats may say it is a way to show our support for Israel. On the contrary, we should show that we have a new approach to Iran by defeating Jack Lew's nomination. During the confirmation hearing, Republicans are expected to focus on an interaction Lew had before the Foreign Relations Committee when he was treasury secretary in 2015, when he said Iran will continue to be denied access to the YOU.S. financial and commercial market. In 2016, the Treasury Department issued a license granting Iran access to YOU.S. financial systems, but American banks eventually declined, fearing legal and compliance risks. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., another Foreign Relations Committee member, said in an interview on Fox Business Network that he has real concerns that Lew has misled and lied to Congress in the past in terms of the some of the financial arrangements that were made under the Obama administration. Rubio, however, said he thinks the YOU.S. should have an ambassador in every country, and he stopped short of expressing opposition to Lew's nomination. Lew has faced opposition from other Senate Republicans. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, said on X last week that Lew was the key point man in negotiations  disinfo campaign for Obama's dangerously flawed deal w Iran. The consequences are felt today as Iran -- flush w cash due to Biden's push to revive the deal at any cost -- has fueled carnage in Israel, he tweeted. Lew must answer for the failed Obama-Biden Middle East strategy as he appears before the Senate Foreign Relations committee for his confirmation hearing. In 2015, the YOU.S. and other countries entered a nuclear deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which eased sanctions on Iran in return for strict limits on its nuclear program designed to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions while introducing new ones. Republicans criticized Lew in 2016 when, as part of a settlement between the YOU.S. and Iran, he defended a 1.7 billion cash payment to Iran's government. Lew is also likely to be asked about the debate over whether to provide Iran access to 6 billion as part of a prisoner swap deal with the YOU.S. last month. Days after Hamas' attack in Israel, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House Democrats that the YOU.S. and Qatar had agreed to block Iran from accessing the funds, according to three sources familiar with his remarks.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

But who would govern Gaza after that?,"Biden administration officials and lawmakers support Israel's plans to strike hard at Hamas but they worry their ally has no clear plan for who will govern Gaza if and when the militants are driven out, according to sources familiar with the matter, members of Congress and former YOU.S. officials. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, an organization that has been entrenched in Gaza for decades and in power since 2006, but the Israeli government has yet to outline what it envisions for the densely populated enclave after the military operation ends. Israel does not appear to have a plan or strategy for what will follow its military offensive, said Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. That is obviously a big problem, as we learned in both Iraq and Afghanistan, said Moulton, who served in Iraq as a Marine. You have to have a plan for the day after and fundamentally it has to be a political plan, he said. Even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken holds marathon crisis talks this week with Israel and other regional governments to avoid a humanitarian calamity in Gaza, Blinken and other officials are also exploring what will come next for Gaza if Hamas is no longer in charge. Whenever we are coming out of this we need a future for the Palestinians that is viable. One lesson of this whole thing is, that is going to be a necessity, Derek Chollet, counselor to the secretary of state, told NBC News. Chollet said Blinken raised the issue of how Gaza will be governed in talks on Tuesday with Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories. Part of the conversation Blinken is having today with President Abbas is what is the future of Gaza without Hamas and what does that mean for the Palestinian Authority and their role? Chollet said Tuesday. On Capitol Hill, preliminary discussions have begun about Gaza's political future, congressional aides said. The Biden administration has vowed unwavering support for Israel after it suffered a surprise attack from Hamas over its southern border on October 7 that left 1,400 dead, mostly civilians, and an estimated 200 captive. But officials also worry about the effects of a massive Israeli bombardment and an expected ground offensive into Gaza on Palestinian civilians, and how a rising civilian death toll could blow up any international effort to rebuild Gaza without Hamas in control. Asked about what will come next in Gaza if Hamas is rooted out, an Israeli official said: At this point, Israel is focused on establishing a humanitarian zone for civilians in Gaza and on destroying Hamas' military capabilities. Other Israeli officials contacted by NBC News declined to comment on the record or did not respond. Israel remains in a state of shock from the Hamas assault, which shattered the country's sense of security, and is preoccupied with the immediate task of striking at their adversaries, former YOU.S. officials said. There is an imperative for Israel to kill the leadership, to destroy the stockpiles of weapons, munitions, explosives, to destroy as much of the military infrastructure as possible, said John Brennan, the former director of the CIA who served in the Middle East during his career at the agency. But the day after, it is hard to envision. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday that the administration was trying to examine how Gaza would be governed in the future. These are important long-term questions to begin asking and grappling with today. We believe that Israel is grappling with them, we are talking to them about them, Sullivan told CBS' Face the Nation. I am not going to share the details of those private conversations. But what I will say is, right now, the focus of the Israeli operation is on that terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. Biden has said that it would be a big mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again. The president said he believed Hamas should be eliminated entirely but there ... needs to be a path to a Palestinian state, he told CBS' 60 Minutes in an interview that aired on Sunday. Given the deep uncertainty about how the Israeli military offensive against Hamas unfolds and how the region reacts, it is almost impossible to draft a plan for Gaza at the moment, some former officials and experts said. The elements of any plan for Gaza would likely involve a transition period under YOU.N. or international authority; an important role for the Palestinian Authority; removing Hamas' weapons arsenal under the supervision of a third party; strong support from Egypt; elections; major international funding especially from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states for the rebuilding of Gaza; and a new peace process designed to forge a two-state solution, said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former senior State Department official who focused on Middle East policy. Such a scenario would mean the sun, the moon and the stars aligning over a period of months and years, Miller said. Talking about a new political future for Gaza is like talking about a galaxy far, far away given the unpredictable factors at work and the daunting political obstacles, he said. Jason Greenblatt, former White House special envoy to the Middle East in the Trump administration, said that the goal should be that once the terrorists are gone, to rebuild Gaza and once and for all try to implement plans that many well-meaning nations have already tried: rebuild Gaza and make it look like it deserves to look. It is a seaside city, he added. It could be incredible. David Friedman, who was YOU.S. ambassador to Israel during the Trump administration, said the endgame for Gaza would be if representatives of the Arab League were willing to step up and kind of pursue some sort of a trusteeship for Gaza for some finite period of time, in a manner that appeals to the Gazans themselves to form institutions for self-governance. For Palestinians, the immediate threat posed by Israel's air raids on Gaza and its order for more than a million civilians to leave northern Gaza make it impossible to contemplate any future political arrangements, much less consider proposals from governments that they believe have abandoned them, said Yousef Munayyer, senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, a think tank. The first and most urgent step needed now is a ceasefire, followed by diplomacy, Munayyer said. The assumptions behind Israeli military action in Gaza were flawed and merely repeating past failures, he said. After Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the Israelis calculated that the costs of maintaining a physical military presence on the ground were too high. So, we have been through this before, Munayyer said. He said that there is no vision for the day after, because it does not exist. Hamas emerged in a power vacuum in Gaza, and militancy would continue to spread as long as the underlying political issues were left unaddressed, he said. The YOU.S. approach in recent years has been to focus on reconciliation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, an idea launched under the Trump administration, as a way of setting the conditions for an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Munayyer said that has proved to be a grave mistake. What we are seeing today, on the ground, is the price that we are paying for ignoring the urgency of dealing with this issue, he said. And there was a great degree of hubris on the part of American policymakers who thought that that was OK. That the YOU.S. could go on with our objectives in the Middle East and elsewhere around the world, without really paying attention to this issue. Despite the current crisis, the Biden administration remains committed to salvaging negotiations for a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an idea that Hamas and its Iranian patrons strongly oppose. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he has spoken at length to Secretary of State Blinken about what could come next for Gaza. We talked about that a lot, said the senator, who was part of a congressional delegation due to visit the region. The Israelis believe that destroying Hamas makes a deal with the Palestinians and peace more likely, not less likely, Graham said in an interview. You have a radicalized population and you have to deal with that. But the conditions for change become better when Hamas goes away, he said. And I do believe that Israel understands there is no normalization with Saudi Arabia without something significant for the Palestinians. Graham said there would need to be a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs the West Bank but was pushed out of Gaza by Hamas, but it would have to be reformed. The PA is the only game in town. But they need to be reformed. Giving a bunch of money to the same old people is probably a waste. It is time for a new generation of Palestinian leadership, he said. But he added that that scenario is a work in progress and it depends on how these military operations end. Since withdrawing from Gaza in 2005, Israel has launched several military operations in the enclave against Hamas, mostly recently in 2021. But Israel will have to re-examine its past assumptions to break the cycle of conflict, said Gershon Baskin, the Middle East director for International Communities Organization, a YOU.K.-based group dedicated to protecting human rights and building peace. If there is a chance of a new tomorrow, with a Gaza that might be able to live in peace with Israel, it has to be a Gaza which is open and developed, where people have work and a chance at a better life, and a future. And it has to be based on the ground rules that Israel can no longer occupy the Palestinian people and expect to live in peace, said Baskin, who helped negotiate the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011 after he was held by Hamas for five years. We have been living with a conceptual delusion that we can have it all and have peace. We cannot lock 2.5 million people in a cage in Gaza and expect for them not to rebel against us.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Exploiting the Palestinian issue has long been a strategic ploy of the Iranian regime. Over the years, Iran's approach has consistently been to sow division and spread Islamic fundamentalism among the Palestinian people, effectively undermining the mainstream Palestinian leadership that is committed to peace and a two-state solution. Hamas was founded in Gaza in 1987. It was an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose candidate Mohamed Morsi won the June 2012 Egyptian presidential elections, but was overthrown within a year after mass protests. Morsi and most of the Brotherhood's leadership were imprisoned in Egypt and the organization was designated as a terrorist group and its assets were seized. Inspired by the Brotherhood, Hamas published a charter in 1988 defining itself as an Islamic national liberation and resistance movement with a policy of establishing an Islamic State in Palestine. Hamas differs from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in that it rejects negotiations with Israel and advocates armed resistance. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2006, defeating its rival Fatah in elections, and has maintained this position ever since. The relationship between Iran and Hamas began in the early 1990s, a few years after Hamas was founded. Iran sees support for Hamas as a means of challenging Israel and extending its influence in the region. Over time, Iran has provided significant financial support to Hamas, particularly after it took power in Gaza in 2006. Iran's aid enabled Hamas to develop its own weapons, with Khaled Mashal, the former head of its political bureau, describing Hamas as the spiritual son of (Ayatollah) Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.When Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006, the Iranian regime increased its support, providing funding, rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles, as well as training and technical assistance through its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) elite Quds Force, responsible for foreign operations. Iran's support for Hamas has continued to strengthen, particularly in the period from 2015 to 2018, which was characterized by the growing threat from Israel and Hamas's increased reliance on Iranian sponsorship. The potency of the relationship was further evidenced by Iran's increased presence in Gaza through proxies such as Islamic Jihad. Some of the fighters involved in the recent terrorist assault on Israel led by Hamas militants belonged to Islamic Jihad, the second-most powerful Palestinian militant group operating in the Gaza Strip with backing from Iran. Like Hamas, Islamic Jihad is also designated as a terrorist group, blacklisted by the UK, EU and US. The closeness of the relationship was amplified in August 2021, when the Hamas leader - Ismail Haniyeh and his team, were invited to attend the inauguration of President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran. Raisi, dubbed 'The Butcher of Tehran' for his notorious role as an executioner during the 1988 massacre of more than 30,000 political prisoners, ensured that the Hamas delegation was met at the airport and seated in the front row during the ceremony. During a series of high-level meetings following the inauguration, Hamas confirmed its unwavering support for the 'axis of resistance' against Israel and for the Iranian regime's proxy wars in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Since then, there has been an increasing flow of rockets, anti-tank missiles and other sophisticated weaponry, smuggled into Gaza through tunnels from Egypt, some of which are large enough to be fitted with rail tracks, and from ships docking in Gaza's ports. Iran has also provided huge financial support to Hamas, both directly and indirectly. Direct funding includes cash payments to Hamas' operatives and officials, as well as specific operations. Indirect funding includes the provision of goods and services, such as medical supplies and construction materials, which Hamas can sell or trade for income. The funding has increased to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Last year, the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, told Al-Jazeera TV that Iran had funded its deterrent forces against Israel and had helped to build attack tunnels to be used to surprise the Israelis. But it must be remembered that the Iranian people do not support the regime's massive spending on proxy wars and militias like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, across the Middle East. With a collapsing economy and widespread poverty, the recent nationwide uprising in Iran has been marked by protesters chanting slogans decrying financial aid to groups like Hamas, highlighting the deep gulf between the mullahs' regime and the public it is supposed to serve. Hamas militants share a philosophy of hatred. They are misogynists. They hate the Jews. They hate Christians. They hate atheists. They hate alcohol, music and Western freedoms. These pet hates manifested themselves in a frenzy of brutality and murder, when they attacked young party goers attending the Supernova music festival at the Re'i am Kibbutz, just three miles from the border with Gaza. The all-night, alcohol-fueled party would have represented the embodiment of all of the militants' warped prejudices, unleashing a bloodbath of mass slaughter and butchery. As the crisis unfolds and retaliation by the Israeli military escalates, killing hundreds of Palestinian militants and civilians, there is only one winner likely to emerge from the conflict....Iran. Already Saudi Arabia, a signatory to the Abraham Accords that sought rapprochement with Israel, has put the plans to normalize relations with Tel Aviv on ice. This will be seen as a great victory in Tehran. Pulverising Gaza will only create a new generation of Hamas terrorists. As Naftali Bennett, the former prime minister of Israel once said, there is no use in struggling against the tentacles of the Iranian regime that encircle Israel. Better to strike at the head of the octopus in Tehran. Seventy five million Iranians want rid of the mullahs' regime. We should support them.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

That would never be the way that we would operate. Both CEOs were questioned by MPs at a special session of the committee about the bank holiday Monday systems failure. The main and back-up computer systems that normally assist air-traffic controllers failed around 8.30am on the morning of 28 August 2023. The because was later found to be a rogue flight plan for a French aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Paris, which contained duplicate waypoints. Nats engineers solved the previously unknown problem about eight hours later. For much of that time, air-traffic controllers were obliged to revert to manual handling - reducing the capacity of UK airspace by 85 per cent. The failures led to more than 2,000 flight cancellations, affecting over 300,000 passengers. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, condemned the delay between the initial failure and when carriers were alerted shortly after 11am. He said that with more notice, airlines could have put emergency procedures in place much earlier. There was a three-hour window wasted, he said. Mr O'Leary described the Nats boss as vastly overpaid and incompetent and said Mr Rolfe should resign or be sacked after the incident. Like most airlines we did not find out from Nats, we found out from Eurocontrol shortly after 11am, he said. The numpties at Nats did not tell us. We had to find out from someone else that they would crashed their system. Nats said the standard procedure was for Eurocontrol, which oversees air-traffic control across Europe, to communicate with airlines. Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer of easyJet, said: The first time we heard from Nats was a letter the following day. In total, her airline had cancelled around 600 flights. That is thought to have affected more than 100,000 passengers. She said 30,000 passengers had been re-routed by another carrier or on other forms of transport. Eurostar laid on extra trains between Paris and London in the days following the air-traffic control shutdown to help UK-bound passengers, with airlines footing the bill for rail tickets. Both Ryanair and easyJet are thought to have incurred around 15m each in costs for hotels, meals and re-routing passengers. Jonathan Hinkles, chief executive of Loganair, said airlines were insurers of last resort because of the current regime of passengers' rights. If you buy a new washing machine, you have the choice to buy extended warranty, he said. If you are insuring a car, you can choose between fully comprehensive. Every single air ticket that is sold comes with an extended warranty and fully comprehensive insurance. Martin Rolfe, chief executive of Nats, was questioned immediately afterwards by MPs. He told the committee: I absolutely understand the frustration of the airlines. The shutdown was triggered, he said, despite development work trying to predict as many obscure circumstances as you can. Within 20 seconds of the main system shutting down, the back-up did the same. The back-up system had taken over on four occasions over the last five years without an issue, Mr Rolfe said. He added: In the event of something happening that is inexplicable, it is handed on to humans. We have put in a number of fixes to ensure it cannot happen again. While charges at Nats had increased due to dwindling traffic during Covid, Alistair Borthwick - chief financial officer at Nats - said that since 2002 costs have reduced by 38 per cent in real terms. Nats is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The authority's chief executive, Rob Bishton, described the Nats system failure as a rare and very improbable event that had had huge impacts with people who were travelling. He said Nats had been fined 420,000 in 2016 and 240,000 in 2018 for shortcomings in the service provided, but said the effect of penalties could be to push up air-traffic control charges for airlines, and ultimately passengers. Mr Bishton also complimented both sides in the row. He said: The airlines' response during the incident was in many cases above and beyond what we would expect as a regulator. Later, he added: I believe Nats has been very open and transparent.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Their appearance together came as President Joe Biden arrived in Tel Aviv in a show of support for Israel following a devastating and coordinated terrorist attack by Hamas militants on kibbutzim, music festivals and city streets on October 7, and ahead of an expected Israeli ground assault in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave that Hamas controls. Biden said he was outraged by the blast at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday that is estimated to have killed hundreds of people and for which Israel and Hamas have blamed each other. The blast has set off protests across the Middle East and threatens to derail diplomatic efforts by the YOU.S. and others to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which as of Wednesday had killed more than 3,400 people in Gaza and 1,400 people in Israel. Putin called the hospital blast a terrible event and a disaster. I really hope that this will be a signal that this conflict should be ended as quickly as possible, he said at a news conference. In any case, it is necessary to work towards a possibility of starting some contacts and negotiations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Beijing was shocked by and strongly condemns the hospital explosion, expressing condolences to the victims and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians. Putin also said he was optimistic about the future of the China-Russia relationship and that conflicts like his war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war only made it stronger. All these external factors are common threats, and they strengthen Russian-Chinese cooperation, he said. Representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries, including heads of state, gathered at the imposing Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square for a two-day forum marking the 10th anniversary of Xi's signature Belt and Road initiative. Under the program, China has financed major infrastructure projects around the world in an effort to strengthen relations with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, though in some cases they have been criticized as saddling low-income countries with excessive debt. In a speech at the opening ceremony on Wednesday, Xi said the Belt and Road initiative had established a new framework for international cooperation. He also warned against efforts by the YOU.S. and other countries to reduce their dependence on China, the world's second-largest economy, by decoupling. Beijing has objected to measures it sees as aimed at containing its rise such as YOU.S. export controls on semiconductor chips, which the Commerce Department said on Tuesday it was expanding for national security reasons. Viewing others' development as a threat or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one's own life better or speed up one's development, Xi said, as Putin looked on from the front row. Speaking after Xi, Putin praised the Belt and Road initiative as truly a global plan that is aimed at creating more equitable, multipolar world relations. Most Western European countries and other YOU.S. allies kept their representation at the Belt and Road forum to a minimum, including Italy, which looks set to formally withdraw from the initiative. The Italian ambassador to China was one of several European officials who walked out while Putin was speaking in protest of the Ukraine war. China's ties with the West have been strained by its economic and political support for Russia in that war, which Beijing refrains from calling an invasion. During a meeting with Putin on Wednesday that lasted about three hours, Xi said that China supports Russia in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, according to a readout published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry that did not mention Ukraine. The war between Israel and Hamas has only deepened Western disagreement with China and Russia, both of which have avoided condemning Hamas and say the fundamental solution to the conflict is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. In remarks before their meeting on Wednesday, Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of their countries' strong relationship. Both countries have deepened our mutual political trust and maintained strategic coordination in a close and effective manner, Xi said, noting that trade between the two countries reached a record 190 billion last year. In the current difficult conditions, close foreign policy coordination is especially necessary, Putin told Xi. The two longtime leaders, who declared a no limits partnership between their countries last year at a meeting in Beijing weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have met more than 40 times in the last 10 years and frequently mention their friendship. Putin's trip to China is his first outside the former Soviet Union since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him in March that accused him of illegally sending children to Russia from Ukraine. Vietnamese state media reported Tuesday that during the forum Putin also accepted an invitation from Vietnam's president to visit Hanoi soon. While in Beijing, Putin also met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the only European Union government leader to attend the forum, in one of the few meetings Putin has had with any European leader since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

These are colour-coded using a system not too dissimilar to that of traffic lights with yellow, amber and red warnings being used. While yellow and amber warnings are more common, it is very rare that we see a red alert in the UK. What do yellow and amber Met Office weather warnings mean? Yellow weather warnings: These weather warnings are issued for a range of weather situations that are likely to cause some low-level impact (such as travel disruption) to a limited area. Such weather warnings mean most people can continue with their day as normal. Other yellow warnings are issued when extreme weather is capable of causing an impact on most but where the certainty of this is much lower. Amber weather warnings: Moving up in severity is the amber warning which is used when severe weather has the potential to disrupt plans. This means the weather could hinder travel, because road and rail closures, and power cuts and pose a risk to life and property. When these are issued, residents should change or alter their plans to protect themselves. When these are released by the organisation, it is advised that residents affected take action to keep themselves and others safe as there is a risk to life. There is also likely to be substantial disruption to travel and infrastructure.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The lead defense lawyer for convicted Fugees hip hop star Prakazrel Pras Michel improperly relied on an experimental generative AI program to draft his closing argument in Michel's high-profile criminal trial last spring, according to a newly-filed brief demanding a retrial for Michel. Michel's new counsel from ArentFox Schiff said that the AI-generated closing argument by Michel's previous lawyer, David Kenner, was a resounding flop: Kenner's closing argument made frivolous arguments, misapprehended the required elements, conflated the schemes and ignored critical weaknesses in the government's case, the brief said. By using an experimental AI program to generate his closing argument, the brief said, Kenner botched the single most important portion of Michel's jury trial. Kenner did not immediately respond to two email queries on the new brief. His co-counsel Alon Israely did not immediately respond to a query sent via LinkedIn. Michel was convicted in April on federal charges of conspiring with fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low in three alleged lobbying schemes to influence two different YOU.S. presidential administrations. His new lawyers contend Kenner's defense of Michel was woefully inadequate, in part because he relied on the AI program EyeLevel.AI to craft his final argument in the complex, politically charged case, which featured testimony from Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio and former YOU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The AI program failed Kenner, and Kenner failed Michel, the brief said. The closing argument was deficient, unhelpful and a missed opportunity that prejudiced the defense. What is even more egregious, according to the ArentFox brief, is that Kenner and Israely appear to have had an undisclosed financial interest in a company called CaseFile Connect, which acted as a technology partner to EyeLevel.AI. The brief asserts that Kenner and Israely regarded Michel's trial as an opportunity to tout CaseFile Connect, advancing their own financial interests at Michel's expense. CaseFile Connect did not immediately respond to queries sent through its website. In a declaration accompanying the brief, ArentFox partner Peter Zeidenberg, a former Justice Department political corruption prosecutor, said his team first learned that Kenner had used an AI program to write his closing argument from Michel's former publicist, who told ArentFox that Kenner said as much at the end of Michel's trial. ArentFox subsequently found a little-noticed May 10 press release issued by EyeLevel.AI after Michel's trial, hailing the first use of generative AI in a federal trial. The press release included a quote from Kenner, who said that the AI program turned hours or days of legal work into seconds, and called his use of the program a look into the future of how cases will be conducted. Zeidenberg's declaration also cited a LinkedIn post by an EyeLevel.AI executive who confirmed the program's use at Michel's trial. AI startup I have been working on is now the first use of AI in a federal criminal trial, the executive wrote in the post. Defense lawyers for Fugees star Pras Michel used our platform to rapidly research and help draft closing arguments. EyeLevel.AI said in an emailed statement that Kenner and Israely do not have a financial stake in its program. EyeLevel's AI for legal is a powerful tool for human lawyers to make human decisions, but do so faster and with far greater information at their fingertips, the company said in response to ArentFox's criticism of its closing argument. EyeLevel is able to ingest and understand complex legal transcripts based solely on the facts of the case as presented in court. ArentFox said it had determined that CaseFile Connect and Kenner's law firm both listed the same office suite in Encino, California, as their primary address. CaseFile Connect's alternative address, according to Zeidenberg's declaration, was a New York City office associated with Kenner co-counsel Israely. CaseFile's website did not disclose its owners, ArentFox said, but the overlap in addresses, Zeidenberg said in his declaration, appears to confirm that Mr. Kenner and Mr. Israely had a financial interest in the AI program Mr. Kenner used to write the closing argument and then boasted about after trial. The ArentFox lawyer said in the filing that his team had contacted Kenner and Israely through their counsel but they declined to speak with Michel's new lawyers about the trial. The motion seeking a retrial for Michel also argued that the proceeding was tainted because the trial judge, YOU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Washington, D.C., allowed jurors to hear that she and another federal judge had already concluded, in the context of the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege, that Michel conspired with an alleged co-conspirator to commit some of the crimes the government charged. Those references, along with allegedly improper testimony about Michel's guilt from the lead case agent on his case, turned the jury into a rubber stamp, the brief argued. The brief listed a litany of purported failures by Kenner, in addition to the alleged AI closing argument fiasco. Among the most serious is ArentFox's accusation that Kenner, who is not an expert in complex white-collar cases or lobbying regulations, outsourced trial preparation to inexperienced contract attorneys at an e-discovery company co-founded by Israely, an old friend. That inadequate preparation was fatal to Kenner's attempts to cross-examine government witnesses, the brief said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Mark Drakeford told MPs belonging to the Welsh Affairs Committee that the petition will be responded to in the usual way that Senedd petitions are considered. But he said that would not happen until at least next March, because the organiser of the petition has not agreed to close the petition early. That means it will remain open for the full six month period. The First Minister was asked by the committee chair, the Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, if he recognised concerns about 20mph zones that he said had been expressed by some of the emergency services. In response, Mark Drakeford said that There are some individual voices in some services that have expressed concern. The services themselves have not and of course we work very closely with them. The rules are no different in a 20 mile an hour road than they are in a 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 mile road. Emergency services are able to travel above the speed limit where there is a case for them to do so. None of that has changed. And I think a number of these concerns are concerns in advance of the facts, when it comes to operating the system on the ground, I do not think that those fears will materialise. Mark Drakeford also told MPs that he does not believe a single penny will be spent on electrifying the main railway line across the north of Wales by the UK Government. In his recent speech to the Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister announced that the northern part of the HS2 rail project would be cancelled and the money saved would be spent on other projects. That included a pledge to spend 1bn on electrification of the North Wales main line. The First Minister was asked by Conservative MP Robin Millar why the Welsh Government had responded to that announcement by saying that electrification was not a priority for Wales. Mark Drakeford said: First of all, the so-called promise unravelled very quickly indeed, when the Secretary of State for Transport in the UK Government said that this was merely an illustrative list, but nobody was to take it as meaning that this was actual money for actual activity. So you know, I do not think a single penny will be spent on this scheme during the lifetime of the current government. As for the issue about whether or not it is a priority the First Minister said that what our Minister pointed to was the joint committee, a committee made up of representatives of the Welsh Government and the UK Government prioritising plans for rail investment in north Wales, but that committee with UK representatives on it had not put electrification of the main line at the top of the list for investment. The announcement was made with no reference to the group that had been established between two governments to draw up priority plans. I am afraid there is very little confidence amongst people in North Wales that this will ever happen because they saw the experience in South Wales which was promised twice that there will be electrification of the mainline and twice that ban was reversed.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Iran wants an immediate and complete embargo on the Zionist regime by Islamic countries, an oil embargo against the regime, according to a statement from the foreign ministry on Telegram quoted by Bloomberg. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has also called for Muslim countries to expel their respective Israeli ambassadors if they have diplomatic relations with Israel. Amirabdollahian warned, If the war crimes do not stop and the ongoing genocide by the apartheid Zionist regime in Gaza continues, the situation in the region will spiral out of control. Amirabdollahian met with his Kuwaiti counterpart on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)'s Executive Committee in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The emergency meeting is taking place hours after a missile strike on a hospital in Gaza killed about 500 people, with Israel's army and Hamas blaming each other for the attack, which sent oil prices jumping by more than 2 early on Wednesday. Meanwhile, YOU.S. President Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday to discuss the conflict. Following the bombing of the hospital, a meeting of Arab leaders and Biden in Jordan was canceled. Biden claimed that, from what he has seen, the explosion at the hospital was not carried out by Israel but by the other team. Israel is a small oil importer, but the further escalation of the Hamas-Israel war into the wider Middle East is not being ruled out, and analysts are increasingly concerned about supply from the world's most important oil-exporting region. With Saudi Arabia also taking a pro-Palestine stance in its recent conversations with the YOU.S., the possibility for a quick end of the fighting is fading away while the possibility of greater regional involvement appears to be rising if oil prices are any indication.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

He told a news conference during a visit to China that he had briefed President Xi Jinping in some detail about Ukraine. He said external factors and common threats served only to strengthen Russia-Chinese cooperation. The Kremlin chief said Washington's decision to supply the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), whose use Kyiv confirmed on Tuesday, just prolongs the agony for Ukraine. Firstly, this of course causes harm and creates an additional threat. Secondly, we will of course be able to repel these attacks. War is war, Putin said. But most importantly, it fundamentally lacks the capacity to change the situation on the line of contact at all ... This is another mistake by the United States. Ukraine had repeatedly asked Washington for ATACMS to help it attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory. A mistake of a larger scale, as yet invisible but still of great importance, is that the United States is becoming more and more personally drawn into this conflict. And let no one say that they have nothing to do with this. We believe they do, Putin said. He noted that the United States had sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean in response to the explosion of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, and said he had ordered Russian planes with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to patrol over the Black Sea. Putin said it was good that the West was starting to talk about the need to solve the Ukraine crisis by peaceful means, though he did not cite examples. Russia has long said it is willing to negotiate, but only if Kyiv accepts new realities, meaning Moscow's occupation of more than a sixth of Ukraine. Kyiv insists on a full withdrawal of Russian forces, including from the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. Train services in the Highlands will be cancelled tomorrow and Friday as severe weather is expected to affect several north lines. Network Rail said that the Far North Line between Inverness and WickThurso and the Aberdeen to Elgin line will be closed after the Met Office issued a rare red weather warning earlier today. Storm Babet is expected to bring torrential rain in Angus and Aberdeenshire and wind gusts of up to 70mph to parts of the north, with an amber warning issued for parts of the Highlands. The line between Perth and Aviemore will also remain closed and speed restrictions will be introduced on lines in central and eastern Scotland.

Our engineers will thoroughly inspect the network for any damage before we reopen the lines and restart train services. Weather specialists, based in our control room, will monitor conditions closely throughout Thursday and Friday, and our teams on the ground will be ready to deal with any issues Storm Babet may cause. Earlier today, the Met Office upgraded a yellow weather warning for rain and wind across the country to an amber and a rare red due to the torrential rain that is forecast across Angus and south Aberdeenshire from Thursday until Friday afternoon. This follows major disruption caused by torrential rain earlier this month. Those in areas impacted by the red warning are being strongly advised not to travel. Amber warnings for high winds have also been issued, with very strong winds expected on the east coast and far north of Scotland, which could uproot trees and blow them onto the tracks, damaging railway infrastructure. Engineers will inspect the affected lines on Saturday morning for any damage, and will reopen them as soon as it is safe to do so. Scotland's Railway will use a combination of locomotives, foot patrols and helicopter inspections to do this. A revised timetable will be in place across central and eastern areas of Scotland's Railway on Thursday and Friday due to the extended journey times that the speed restrictions will bring. These changes are being put in place as a precaution against potential flood damage to the railway as heavy rain can cause landslips onto the tracks or wash the stone ballast away from beneath the rails. Extra engineers are being deployed across Scotland's Railway to inspect lines, repair damage, and reopen routes as quickly as possible for passengers and freight customers once the weather clears on Saturday. The following routes will be closed on Thursday and Friday: Passengers are advised to check their journey before travelling at National Rail Enquiries or with their train operator.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The commercial services on India's first RRTS will start on the stretch from Saturday. On Wednesday, News18 travelled on the section from Sahibabad. There were four stops - Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, and Duhai Depot. Without stopping at any of these stations, the fully-air conditioned train completed the 17-kilometre trip in around five minutes. The commercial journey though will take 12 minutes. By road, the minimum travel time is around 30-35 minutes. The train will be running at a speed of 160 kmph. While until the platform the RRTS seems like a metro service, the moment one enters the train, it gives the feel of Vande Bharat service, but without the facility of rotating seats and toilets in the train. Unlike metros, and similar to the Vande Bharat, there are two classes in the six-coach trains - five standard coaches and a premium coach. Entry to the premium coach will be accessible only through a premium lounge situated in one corner made at the platform level across the section. So those travelling in the premium class have to go through two entry points - one at the entrance of the station where the ticket will be scanned and one at the platform. Those travelling in metros are well aware of the metal seats. Here, the RRTS is different. Across the classes, RRTS offers comfortable cushioned seats. The main entry to the station and concourse are exactly like the metro service with automated fare collection gates. There are 10 train sets with the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) that will be operational on the stretch. Across the train, there is a display unit after a certain number of seats, sharing the details of the next station, train speed, and the upcoming stations. At the platform, electronic display units have been installed that will share the details of upcoming trains. The train service will start from 6 am and continue till 11 pm. The minimum fare for the standard class is Rs 20 and the maximum is Rs 50. For the premium class, it is Rs 40 and Rs 100. From the Sahibabad side, the fare for Ghaziabad and Guldhar is Rs 30 for standard class and Rs 60 for premium class. For Duhai, the fare is Rs 40 and Rs 80 depending on the class while for Duhai Depot it is Rs 50 and Rs 100. The system offers a number of ticketing options, ranging from paper QR code-based journey tickets - from Ticket Vending Machines or the Ticket counters at the stations - to the National Common Mobility Card and Digital QR code-based tickets through the NCRTC mobile application, RAPIDX Connect. The RRTS system will allow commuters to use any NCMC card from the first day of operations for travelling. Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis across the train. However, seats have been numbered. At the Sahibabad station, from the concourse, there are two directions for the platform for the up and down trains. At the platform, there are screen doors across the stretch. When the train arrives, these doors will be opened. The twist here is that, unlike the metro, all coach gates will not open automatically. There will be buttons on both sides of the gates - inside and out - from where passengers who want to get down or board the train can operate the gates. It has been done to optimise the temperature. In the standard coach, there are 18 rows - each with four red-coloured seats. There is a dedicated USB point for each passenger for charging electronic items. One coach in every RAPIDX train is reserved for women; it is the carriage next to the premium coach. Also, seats are reserved in the other coaches of the train for women, the specially-abled, and senior citizens. In total, for women, there is a dedicated 72-seat coach and 10 seats are reserved in other coaches. One coach has a dedicated space for wheelchairs. In total, each train has a seating capacity of around 400, but every RAPIDX train with six coaches can carry around 1,700 commuters including those standing. Those boarding these coaches have to go through two-stage automated fare collection gates, one at the entry and another at the platform. This is the first-of-its-kind mechanism in the country. As the name suggests, the coach, having 15 rows each with ergonomically designed 22 transverse seating in blue colour, offers a lot of features for the comfort of passengers starting from reclining seats, coat hooks, magazine holders, and footrests. For each seat, there is a USB and plug point for charging laptops as well. The first carriage moving towards Meerut from Delhi and the last coach moving towards Delhi from Meerut will be the premium coach. The coach also has a wide standing space for those who did not get a seat. Further, there is a vending machine from where snacks or drinks can be bought both inside the coach and at the lounge.

The Met Office is responsible for issuing weather warnings, which notify people of the risks and potentail impacts caused by severe weather. They are graded by colour with red the most severe, then amber and then yellow. A red weather warning means dangerous weather is expected and it is very likely there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel and energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. Those in the affected area are warned to avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities. An amber weather warning means there is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, including potential risk to life and property. There is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures and power cuts. A yellow weather warning is issued when it is likely the weather will cause some low-level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places. Some yellow warnings are issued when the weather could bring much more severe impacts to the majority of people but the certainty of those impacts occurring is much lower. This is the first red warning for rain issued in the UK since Storm Dennis in February 2020. A red weather warning was issued in 2022 for extreme heat, covering much of central and southern England, during the July heatwave that year when temperatures soared to 40C. The Met Office has warned of exceptional rainfall expected to cause severe flooding and disruption. This includes the possibility of danger to life from fast-flowing or deep floodwater, extensive flooding to homes and businesses, and collapsed or damaged buildings or structures. The Met Office also cautioned that travel is likely to be affected with road closures, bus and train service delays and cancellations, and dangerous driving conditions because of spray and flooded roads. It said local communities hit by the storm might experience loss of power and other essential services, such as gas, water and mobile phone networks, and could be potentially be completely cut off for several days. Less than two weeks ago, heavy rainfall across Scotland caused major disruption with extensive flooding and landslides. Chief meteorologist Jason Kelly said: Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the red warning. One hundred to 150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts, with flooding likely. He said Storm Babet would track gradually northwards in the coming days, and although the most significant impacts are expected within the red and amber warning areas, there will still be wider impacts for much of the UK from this wind and rain. Amber weather warnings for wind and rain have been issued for parts of eastern Scotland on Thursday and Friday. Yellow weather warnings have been issued across the week from Thursday until Saturday for a large part of the UK, covering parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and northern and eastern England.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Sir John Armitt warned that it would be a mistake to sell the land in a rush after Rishi Sunak betrayed the north by scrapping plans to extend the high speed rail line to Manchester to save cash. Land on the abandoned route north of Birmingham was protected to prevent conflicting developments - but the Department for Transport has now lifted the restrictions. Any property that is no longer required for HS2 will be sold and a programme is being developed to do this, the department said. But Sir John, the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, told the Government it needed a proper consideration about how best we can connect Birmingham and Manchester and give us that improved capacity that we still need. He told the BBC : I think it is a mistake. I think that the land should be kept for at least two or three years to give the opportunity for people to revisit that and look at what can be done within that space and find a more cost-effective solution, not write it off today. I am disappointed because I think it is what we often describe as a sort of knee-jerk, snap reaction. The PM desperately tried to deflect criticism of his decision to axe HS2's northern leg by diverting the 36billion earmarked for the Birmingham to Manchester route to other transport schemes. But his new 'Network North' blueprint included reheated announcements, some completed years earlier and many that are not even in the North. Sir John said a full evaluation was needed to develop it into a well-thought-through, integrated plan for the future. We had an integrated plan a few weeks ago, we have now lost that, he said. There are a number of projects, some of which already existed, some new ones. Let us get those properly turned into a well-thought-through, integrated plan for the future. A Government spokesperson said: Delivering high-quality infrastructure is the foundation of our future growth. Our Network North plan will deliver the transport that matters most to people, and we are adopting a fairer and more pragmatic approach to meeting net zero that supports households and families to make greener choices whilst easing the burdens on working people. We are delivering over 600bn of planned public sector investment in infrastructure, RD and defence over the next five years, including an unprecedented package to improve connections in our city regions and billions to decarbonise buildings.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The family of the truck driver killed when a train derailed over Interstate 25 Sunday said he had beat cancer and had recently discovered a love of trucking. Lafollette Henderson leaves behind six children, who are all wondering how they could lose their dad to such a freak accident. Federal investigators believe a broken rail caused the train to leave the tracks. Thirty train cars spilled over, with tons of coal. If he maybe would have waited five more minutes. Maybe if he slept 10 more minutes, Henderson's daughter Triana James said. James and her family are haunted by what-ifs. They are left wondering whether a different choice could have saved their father's life.

For us we are just so shocked that out of everybody that went under that bridge, him, she said. Henderson was driving on I-25 in his semi-truck Sunday afternoon. The second he went under the bridge, the BNSF train derailed. I used to call in and check on him when there was an accident, and there is no calling to check on him for this one, she said. Investigators think the broken rail preceded the derailment and the bridge collapse happened after the train derailed. They will continue to investigate why the rail was broken and why warning systems did not alert the crew to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Instead of focusing on why her dad died, James is concentrating on how her dad lived. He is a very dedicated man, and when he is friends with someone he loves them endlessly, she said. I always felt like he was the smartest person in the room. Henderson recently beat cancer, and truck driving became a passion. He started the profession about three years ago. He loved truck driving so much. It was such a joy when he got his license. I remember when he called me - he said boogie. I got my license. I did it. I am going on the road, she said. James said her daughter gave Henderson a stuffed bear to travel with. They called it his safety bear. Of all the cars that drove under that bridge, the timing of this crash feels unfair. I cannot get past just the fact this rate of speed he is going and the time it decided to happen and when it happened, James said. James said her sister had a baby on October 11. James' birthday was on October 13. The crash happened two days later. The family has set up a GoFundMe account to help pay for funeral expenses.

Some persons claiming to be acting on the authority of the NRC on Monday attempted to remove train coaches from the terminus to other parts of the country. They were however stopped by some youths who protested against the move. Zulum on Tuesday during a visit to the NRC Terminal described the attempt to remove the coaches and railway parts as sinister, vowing to unravel the truth behind the move. About five months ago, some of the rolling stocks were conveyed to other states of the federation without the knowledge of the security operatives and Borno State Government, the governor disclosed. He said he contacted the NRC on the matter after attempts to remove train coaches were thwarted by vigilant residents. This time around the community raised alarm when they saw the movement of these rolling stocks from Maiduguri to other parts of the country. When we contacted the management of Nigerian Railway Corporation, they said the rolling stocks would be moved to Jos for a complete overhaul and be dispatched elsewhere, he explained. He said the state would no longer allow the removal of infrastructure at the Maiduguri Terminus again without due process. Nobody will move out any of the rail infrastructures here in Borno State without recourse to the rule of law, Zulum vowed. Railway transport to Maiduguri was suspended over a decade ago in the wake of the Boko Haram insurgency. The terminus in Maiduguri was situated adjacent to the initial headquarters of the insurgents before it was demolished by the government in August 2009 after the Boko Haram insurrection.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The 2024 presidential campaign has been all about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war for the last week, putting foreign policy at the center of every candidate speech and event. That was already the case for former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and she has been vocal at every rally that she stands firmly with Israel since Hamas' attack on October 7. We need to be a friend to Israel. We need to be there every step of the way, Haley stated at a town hall in Rochester, New Hampshire, last week. She added, Do not ever be so arrogant to think that we do not need friends. America always needs friends. Having served at the UN for two years during the Trump administration, and her campaign has intentionally leaned into her foreign policy experience since she jumped into the presidential race. Haley often talks about providing weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia and directly confronting China, since she views China as the United States' biggest foreign adversary. But her foreign policy focus on the trail has renewed in the aftermath of Hamas' attack. In America, we always have to have a leader who has moral clarity, Haley said, who can see the difference between good and evil. That has resonated with some voters who have been drawn to her events by her foreign policy experience, with multiple foreign conflicts that affect the YOU.S. raging. Her international experience, two years as the UN Ambassador -- I think that really does help with the situation where we need all the experience we can get right now. We live in very dangerous times, said voter Randy Oliver from Durham, New Hampshire. Tom Boyer, an independent who plans to vote in New Hampshire's Republican primary, stated Haley's position on strong national defense as it pertains to Ukraine and Israel as one of the factors that drew him to her candidacy. Yes, I think her experience in the UN is very important, Boyer said, adding that he hopes other voters jump on the Haley bandwagon. Sharyn Stewart, an undecided New Hampshire voter, has also taken notice of Haley's time at the UN. Other candidates have good experiences in all regions, but she has an international experience. She is dealt with these people in leadership and the General Assembly, Stewart said. It is not just the Israeli-Hamas war that is drawing some voters to Haley's events. Mathilde Diaz, who grew up in Taiwan, stated before a town hall event she was looking to hear the former UN Ambassador's position on China and Taiwan. I would like to know her stand when it comes to China's position -- on the growing ambition of China, Diaz said. That is been a key theme of Haley's campaign, and Haley addressed China moments later during the town all. We need Ukraine to win, and you know who wants Ukraine to win more than anybody else? Haley told the crowd. Who wants us to continue in the West to continue to support Ukraine? The Taiwanese. Why? Because the Taiwanese know if Ukraine wins, China will not go into Taiwan. There is a lot at stake. From Diaz, Haley's response drew a nod of approval -- and a look of relief.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Politicians and community leaders fear many communities will be left stranded and disconnected due to the scaled back timetables and cancellations of these crucial routes. Earlier this month First Cymru confirmed that as a result of reductions in Welsh Government funding, several of its services are being withdrawn, while several others will no longer run as frequently in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire. Among the changed and cancelled services, one service in Neath Port Talbot has been completely withdrawn on weekdays. Neath Port Talbot Council has expressed concern about this, and said it feared further reductions could follow in April, 2024. For residents in Llanelli, the cuts mean that from October 29, the L1, L2 and L3 services have all been cut, the 110 service to Swansea has been withdrawn and the X11 to Swansea is now to run every hour instead of every 30 minutes South Wales West Regional MS Altaf Hussain has reacted to First Cymru cancelling nine services and reducing the frequency of dozens of others throughout the region. He said: I am urging the Welsh Government to rethink its decision to reduce the subsidies for bus services. First Cymru has made it plain that it is these cuts that are the because of decisions to axe or reduce services. Without a subsidy, and with reduced passenger numbers, many services now cost more to operate than the income they receive. I know that Neath Port Talbot Council has lobbied Welsh Government on this and I fully support them. Many people totally rely on buses to get to work, attend health care appointments or for shopping and socialising. Without these services, people will be cut off and isolated. Once a route has ended, it is almost impossible to get it back and people are then forced to use expensive taxis or rely on friends and families. The Welsh Government is doing everything in its power to deter people from using their cars with its 20mph speed limit and to use public transport instead, but they have failed to invest in this. Our train services in Wales, which are run by Welsh Government, are officially classed as the most unreliable in the whole of the UK and now buses are being axed as well. Their transport policy is utterly incoherent and shambolic. Dr Hussain urged the Welsh Labour Government to ensure that the money that will come to Wales as a consequence of the decision to scrap parts of the HS2 rail scheme is used to support bus services as well as fund other improvements. Tom Giffard MS for South Wales West has branded cuts to bus services as reckless. He added: The Welsh Government's decision, which has led to First Cymru deciding to cut bus services in Swansea, shows a blatant disregard for the needs of our community. This move will further isolate residents, many of whom rely on these routes for work, school, medical appointments, and essential shopping. To boost the economy and deliver environmentally friendly public transport, it is vital that the concerns of local residents and businesses are listened to. Llanelli county councillors Michael Cranham and Sean Rees have also raised concern regarding the the L1 service, which goes through their wards of Bigyn and Glanymor, serving the communities of Penyfan, Seaside and Morfa. Cllr Cranham said: Many people in our communities including our elderly, disabled and parents with young children rely on buses to get around. We do fear these cuts to public transport will leave people isolated. We support the ongoing efforts to try and regenerate Llanelli town centre and a crucial aspect of that is accessibility and therefore we feel that these changes are a backward step, as there would be no bus service to and from the town centre in either mid to late afternoon or evening. Councillor Rees said: It is clear many are worried about the impact these cuts will have on their ability to be able to access essential services including hospital and doctors appointments, home to school travel and travel to work. A spokesperson for First Cymru said: It was inevitable that we needed to make changes to our bus network in Cymru when the Welsh government announced the lower levels of support. We recognise the government has had some tough decisions to make as it changes the way it funds bus services. But at the same time, we share the disappointment customers will feel from the knock-on impact that will have on some routes. Following requests from local councils, we have looked at our whole network to see where changes could be made to work within the reduced funding available, and while the majority of services will not be impacted, where we have made changes we have done all we can to save routes, even if this has meant having to reduce frequencies or hours of operation. Regrettably, some services, which are either being served by other routes or have particularly low passenger numbers, will stop operating. We remain committed to getting more people to use the bus, but adequate levels of funding are essential where passenger numbers are below the cost of operating services. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: We have provided the bus industry with more than 200m to support it through the pandemic and beyond. We continue to work with Transport for Wales and local authorities to provide more stable services. Our new bus legislation will set out how we intend to transform the way bus services are planned and delivered in the future.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

He told a news conference during a visit to China that he had briefed President Xi Jinping in some detail about Ukraine. He said external factors and common threats served only to strengthen Russia-Chinese cooperation. The Kremlin chief said Washington's decision to supply the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), whose use Kyiv confirmed on Tuesday, just prolongs the agony for Ukraine. Firstly, this of course causes harm and creates an additional threat. Secondly, we will of course be able to repel these attacks. War is war, Putin said. But most importantly, it fundamentally lacks the capacity to change the situation on the line of contact at all ... This is another mistake by the United States. Ukraine had repeatedly asked Washington for ATACMS to help it attack and disrupt supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory.A mistake of a larger scale, as yet invisible but still of great importance, is that the United States is becoming more and more personally drawn into this conflict. And let no one say that they have nothing to do with this. We believe they do, Putin said. He noted that the United States had sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Mediterranean in response to the explosion of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, and said he had ordered Russian planes with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to patrol over the Black Sea. Putin said it was good that the West was starting to talk about the need to solve the Ukraine crisis by peaceful means, though he did not cite examples. Russia has long said it is willing to negotiate, but only if Kyiv accepts new realities, meaning Moscow's occupation of more than a sixth of Ukraine. Kyiv insists on a full withdrawal of Russian forces, including from the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

Deep and rapid emission cuts this decade are critical to avoid cataclysmic climate impacts and keep the 1.5C target of the Paris Agreement attainable. The EU's current targeted level of ambition for 2030 remains insufficient and does not reflect its fair contribution to the fight against the climate crisis. Bring forward the EU's climate neutrality target and commit to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 at the latest, with at least 92 gross emission cuts. In light of the advice of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) and the Paris Agreement's equity principles, the EU as a major historic emitter and industrialised economy bears a higher responsibility than the global average in the fight against the climate emergency. The EU should commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest and set climate targets aligned with the 5-year UNFCCC common timeframes agreed at the Glasgow COP, including for 2035. The Commission should make clear in their proposal for a 2040 target how the EU will close the eventual gap between a fair EU GHG budget that meets its responsibilities and a domestic target that takes into account an ambitious emissions pathway. This gap should be closed through additional mitigation measures in the EU and new and additional financial support to developing countries. This support should not result in funds being diverted from climate change adaptation and loss and damage commitments. Protect, restore and enhance Europe's natural carbon sinks, in particular through dedicated and immediate action to revitalise Europe's forests, wetlands, peatlands and agricultural soils at a much larger scale and pace and ensure net removals are additional to - and not used to offset - urgently needed emissions reductions in other sectors. Making Europe's natural sinks more resilient will not only constitute a key pillar in the EU's fight against the climate crisis, but is also essential in protecting and restoring Europe's biodiversity. Sufficient amounts of financing must result in significantly restoring nature across the EU. Step up adaptation to climate change at EU level. Europe is already facing catastrophic consequences of climate change and needs to prepare for adaptation. A binding European law on planned, ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change, grounded in climate justice, is needed. Implementing agro-ecological practices to reduce water consumption and soil degradation in the agricultural sector, greening cities, eliminating concrete surfaces to combat heat islands, and increasing resources dedicated to fire risk management are all effective long-term adaptation measures, which can help to reduce social inequalities. Ensure the EU leads by example for climate justice internationally. Europe needs to deliver on its obligations to the Global South with special attention to least developed countries and small island developing states. The EU should fully honour commitments to providing new and additional international climate finance for mitigation and adaptation, including the collective doubling of adaptation finance by 2025 (based on 2019 levels) in line with its fair share. Public finance contributions should be the focus, with grants and highly concessional finance for mitigation and grants for adaptation prioritised. The EU should also make multi-year pledges at a scale of billions of USD to the new Loss and Damage Fund, and find new revenues from equitable global, EU and national taxes and levies which make big polluters pay for climate damages.Urgent action is needed on debt and tax justice, through significant reform of the IMF and World Bank, debt cancellation, and a UN Tax Convention, to give countries the fiscal space they need for climate and development action. The EU should endorse an inclusive and feminist climate policy as a cornerstone of EU external action and diplomacy. A just approach to international climate action also means making sure its trade policy is supporting rather than contradicting climate and development objectives with trade, financing and investments built around development objectives rather than extraction of raw materials. End the fossil fuel era once and for all. Adopt binding phase-out dates and trajectories to seal the end of the use of coal (by 2030 at the latest), fossil gas (by 2035 at the latest) and fossil oil (by 2040 at the latest). This also necessitates the phase-out of unsustainable and costly technologies such as nuclear power. Ending the reliance on fossil fuels and uranium, which are largely imported, is essential to strengthen the EU's energy resilience, strategic autonomy and security. Put an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies in a socially just manner and stop fossil infrastructure expansion, including for liquefied gas. End the fossil fuel industry's excessive weight on EU and Member States' decision-making processes and stop giving the fossil gas industry another lifeline through ill-considered and inappropriate support for hydrogen. Support for hydrogen should be targeted at hard to electrify sectors only and be produced from additional renewable energy sources. Ensure the EU endorses and supports an international Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. Build a 100 renewable energy system by 2040 with people and nature at its heart. Speed and scale up the deployment of sustainable renewable energy such as wind and solar, and necessary infrastructure, while avoiding new hydropower plants and sources of bioenergy that increase emissions compared to fossil fuels, and ensure renewables provide a share of at least 50 of the EU's energy mix by 2030. Make sure the energy market is strong, resilient, flexible, and people-centred maximising the uptake of variable renewables, demand-side flexibility and electrification, providing affordable energy for all. Empower consumers (households, energy communities, businesses, and small and medium-sized industry) to be on top of their energy production and consumption and optimise the energy demandsupply, fully tapping into the huge benefits in terms of costs, raw material use and land savings from avoiding new infrastructure. Put in place strong support for flexibility measures such as demand side response and storage to ensure the energy system can deal with increasing supply of variable renewable energy. Since local authorities are a key actor in the deployment of renewable energy, European funding needs to be dedicated to local engineering in local authorities and the structures that support them, especially for more human resources and skills. Fully tap into Europe's energy savings potential and adopt EU-wide and national targets to cut energy consumption in half by 2040. Accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency and sufficiency measures in all sectors of the economy and mobilise investments at national, regional and local level to ensure at least 20 energy savings by 2030. Enable a tripling of the renovation rate and a large-scale roll-out of deep renovation for all occupants, a transport modal shift from inefficient aviation to rail and light efficient vehicles, more electric vehicles and the use of more efficient appliances. It will require building on lessons learned to enable structural change and further drastic changes in current production and consumption patterns, including a focus on sufficiency, repair, circularity, recycling, cutting industrial resource use and primary energy demand. Energy savings are key for making Europe independent from energy imports, while helping the economy, leading to more jobs, reducing energy waste, greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills. Advance the just transformation and make the European Green Deal the engine for new jobs. Support local communities of regions dependent on coal and carbon-intensive industries in decline with funds, tools and know-how so they can become prosperous, climate-neutrality oriented and resilient to socio-economic effects of the change. The process needs to be implemented in a transparent and participatory manner, in cooperation with citizens and stakeholders, with the full involvement of trade unions. The European Commission should issue targets and recommendations for qualification and employment in climate-friendly and circular-economy sectors. The Commission and Member States should draw up projections of the upcoming transformation at the regional level, identify potentials for new value-added and employment clusters and assess existing education and training needs. Education and training should be consistently geared towards climate-friendly employment, for example through retraining from automotive to recharging infrastructure, from the aviation to the rail industry, training programmes for the refurbishment of residential buildings, installation of heat pumps and solar panels or employment in the circular economy. Ensure a sustainable and fair natural resources management within and beyond the EU, effectively tackling over-production and over-consumption. Bring back Europe's resource consumption within planetary boundaries and setting ambitious and binding targets to reduce the EU's material footprint and achieve a fully circular economic model throughout all sectors. Ensure due diligence for social, environmental and human rights impacts in critical mineral supply chains, particularly in the Global South. Enhance social protection and cohesion through a redistributive agenda based on the polluter pays principle. Make sure that the costs and benefits of the transition are borne and shared equitably across society, with a greener fiscal system based on the principle that the polluter pays for the full societal harm caused as well as mechanisms to redistribute the costs of the transition fairly. For the transport sector, this entails taxing environmentally harmful fuels at the highest rate in a socially just manner and fully recycling revenues to further enhance climate action, in particular to make sustainable mobility affordable for low income households and massively invest into accelerated expansion of the European rail network. In the agricultural sector, this requires a complete overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards a system where subsidies are strictly linked to sustainable agricultural practices, accelerating an agroecological transition away from industrial agriculture with reduced industrial livestock farming. Increase social resilience and strengthen the increase of dedicated funds enhancing social cohesion and fighting energy poverty, such as the Social Climate Fund, public goods and services for all through policies that enhance the fair redistribution of wealth and resources, sustainability, protection of biodiversity, gender responsiveness, racial equity and societal wellbeing. Align financial flows with the fight against the climate and biodiversity crises. The EU should exclude any possibility of using EU funds for new fossil fuel investments and infrastructure projects in Europe and internationally which increase fossil fuel use. This includes immediately closing all the loopholes that remain in several large EU funding instruments including the Recovery and Resilience Facility and cohesion policy funds and permanently excluding all fossil fuel finance from 2025 onwards. Reform the EU public debt and deficit rules and establish a new EU fund for climate and just transformation to enable the needed investments in the just and green transition. Revise the EU taxonomy to exclude nuclear and gas from green labelling, and regulate private finance to maximise its support to the green transition. Strengthen, protect, resource and support civil society and youth organisations, independent science and research and media across Europe. Protect and expand civic spaces at EU, national and local levels through effective, transparent and timely public participation in policy-making, implementation and expansion of citizens' assemblies and other innovative forms of civic participation at all levels, and firm action against threats or breaches of the rule of law. Ensure meaningful youth participation in formal policy processes and enable young people to design their own future through supporting youth-led initiatives. Strengthen the role of local authorities, citizens and community-led grassroots initiatives in EU decision-making processes and resource them adequately as they are at the forefront of the action against climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Guarantee current and future generations' fundamental rights to a healthy environment, to enjoy a life with dignity and environmental protection. Strengthen citizens' rights to access to justice and improve compliance with environmental and climate obligations at national, EU and international level. Facilitate litigation to hold accountable governments, business and financial institutions for their ongoing investments in fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries and the related human rights effects that such investments can provoke.

The train derailed at KM 5204 at the crossing between Sentolo and Wates stations in Kulon Progo district of Yogyakarta on Tuesday (October 17, 2023). We are coordinating with the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) to investigate the because of the train's derailment, said Didiek Hartantyo, President Director of KAI, in Kulon Progo. KAI has investigated the driver of Argo Semeru train and the driver of Argo Wilis train, which brushed past it soon after the derailment, resulting in both rail tracks getting blocked and both trains suffering damage. Based on a preliminary investigation, the Argo Wilis train driver had time to brake, but the distance was too close, making the accident unavoidable, Hartantyo informed. We do not want to conclude the because of the incident yet. The condition of the train is also roadworthy, and all procedures have been carried out, he added. However, his party is continuing to investigate the because of the Argo Semeru train's derailment. We will continue to investigate this incident and monitor train activity after the incident, he said. Hartantyo said that 32 passengers on the Argo Semeru train needed treatment, while 28 others experienced shock but were sent home later. He added that four passengers were rushed to the hospital. Three of them were already discharged and the other one remained hospitalized due to a head injury. Erni Basri, Director of Railway Safety at the Directorate General of Railways (DJKA) of the Ministry of Transportation, said that she could not provide more details since the investigation was still going on. All train activities always run according to procedures. Train drivers have also been trained and work according to existing standards, she added.

Please try again later verifyErrors  Network Rail is failing to prevent safety risks from unacceptable overcrowding at London's Euston station, regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said. Passengers waiting on the station's concourse often surge forwards when information boards reveal what platform their train is departing from. The ORR visited the station last month after analysing CCTV footage of three incidents of concern in the summer, which showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels and a lack of crowd control. There were reports of minor injuries and the potential for more serious consequences, the regulator said. The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services - such as those in the early morning and late afternoon - are more expensive and less used compared with off-peak services. This can result in overcrowding on off-peak trains at major stations. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said: Managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge, a challenge that our dedicated cross-industry team rise to each day, always putting passengers' wellbeing and safety at the forefront of their minds. Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. The ORR has asked us to look at some other specific areas and our team, along with our train operating colleagues, are already on the case making further improvements. Euston was the UK's fifth busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

It comes as Storm Babet is expected to batter the country tonight with most areas of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland being issued weather warnings. Currently, there are a total of eight warnings spanning across the country for rain and wind of different severities. In fact, Greater Manchester has been issued an extensive 36-hour yellow warning for rain which will not expire until early Saturday morning. The warnings mean that there could be increased risks of flooding and damage to buildings depending on the rainfall intensity. Read more: Storm Babet: Rain warning for Greater Manchester as rare red 'danger to life' alert issued for part of UK On the rare red warning issued in Scotland, Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly said: Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the Red warning. 100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts with flooding likely. Here is a breakdown of all the warnings spannign across the UK in anticipation for Storm Babet... Red warning for rain - East Scotland The red warning for rain covers parts of Invebervie, Laurencekirk, Montrose, Brechin, Forfar, and Kirriemuir and will remain in effect from 6pm on Thursday, October 19 to 12pm on Friday, October 20. The Met Office warns that exceptional rainfall is expected to occur, resulting in 'severe' flooding and disruptions. There is also an increased danger to life from fast-flowing or deep floodwater as well as flooding to homes and businesses. This, in turn, can result in a variety of road closures, public transport disruptions, and damage to buildings or structures. It also warns that communities could be cut off, perhaps for several days. Amber warning for wind - East Scotland The amber warning for wind covers Aberdeen, parts of Dundee, Montrose, Peterhead, and Fraserburgh and will remain in effect from 10am to 6pm on Thursday, October 19. Storm Babet is expected to bring a spell of very strong winds to northeast Scotland which will likely result in disruptions. Along the coast, there is an increased danger to life from large waves and beach materials being thrown onto roads, sea fronts, and properties nearby. There is also an increased risk of power being cut off which could affect things such as mobile phone services. Travel disruptions are also expected in the affected areas, resulting in potential road closures and public transport disruptions. The Met Office also warned that: Flying debris is possible and could lead to injuries or danger to life. Amber warning for rain - East Scotland Storm Babet is expected to bring exceptionally wet conditions across parts of Scotland. Currently, the amber warning is in effect from 6am on Thursday, October 19 until 6pm on Friday, October 20 and will cover Dundee, Perth, Aberdeen, and other surrounding towns. The rain is expected to create dangerous driving conditions and an increased chance of flooding to homes and businesses. Road closures are also expected which may result in delays to bus and train services. Yellow warning for wind - North Scotland A yellow warning for wind will cover the northern half of Scotland from 3am on Thursday, October 19 to 12pm on Friday, October 20. Some major areas affected include Inverness, Ullapool, Thurso, Wick, and Stromness. The yellow warning indicates that there is an increased chance of some roads and bridges closing which can create longer journey times and possible cancellations of bus, rail, air, and ferry services. There is also an increased risk of damage to buildings from tiles being blown from roofs. Amber warning for rain - North Scotland Heavy rain is expected to hit a small area of North Scotland, covering Bonar Bridge and parts of Golspie with the warning remaining in effect from 6pm on Thursday, October 19 to 9pm on Friday, October 20. Affected areas are expected to see fast flowing or deep floodwater which could increase danger to life. Yellow warning for rain - Central, North, and East Scotland A wide part of Scotland will be hit by very wet weather, with a yellow warning being in effect from 6am on Thursday, October 19 to 6am on Saturday, October 21. Major areas affected include Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth, Stirling, Dundee, and Aberdeen. All affected areas are at risk of flooding on roads which can make driving more difficult as well as delays to train and bus services. There is also a small chance that homes and businesses could be damaged from flooding as well as a small chance or floodwater cutting of communities. Yellow warning for rain - North West and North East England It is not just Scotland that will be hit by Storm Babet, parts of England will also be affected, including Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, York, Middlesbrough, Scarborough, Newcastle, Leeds, and York. A yellow warning will cover these areas from 6pm on Thursday, October 19 to 6am on Saturday, October 21. Yellow warning for rain - Northern Ireland The Met Office warns that Storm Babet will bring some heavy rain to Northern Ireland with a yellow warning in effect from 2pm today (October 18) to 10am on Thursday, October 19.

Low pressure areas (LPAs) are linked to the convergence and upward motion of air, forming closed, anti-clockwise wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. And these systems can bring a ton of rainfall across the country when they cross the coasts. Amid the northeast monsoon's impeded arrival due to the southwest monsoon's reluctance to leave, a pair of rain-bearing systems are brewing on either side of South Peninsular India, threatening wet weather to those parts of the sub-continent. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic circulation lying over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea is likely to move west-northwestwards. During this period, it is expected to influence the formation of a low pressure area in the central parts of the Bay by Friday, October 20. In the meantime, another cyclonic circulation that has been stationed over the southeast Arabian Sea since Monday has now given way to the formation of a low pressure area in the region. Weather models indicate that this system will trudge west-northwestwards, developing into a well-marked low pressure area over the next 24 hours and then a depression over the Central Arabian Sea around Saturday, October 21. Its potential strength remains ambiguous for now, but should it further intensify, this system will become the first post-monsoon cyclone in the Arabian Sea this year. It will then be named 'Tej' in accordance with the naming list followed for cyclones in the Indian Ocean region. Accordingly, the IMD has predicted up to moderate showers accompanied by thunderstorms and lighting in Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Wednesday, October 18. Some scattered to fairly widespread rains might permeate South Interior Karnataka as well. Thunderstorm activity is expected to prevail over Kerala until October 19 while light to moderate rains are likely in Tamil Nadu until October 23. Given these predictions, a yellow watch has been issued across Kerala and Tamil Nadu for today so as to urge locals to 'be updated' about the inclement weather. Fisherfolk along the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts have been cautioned against venturing into sea today and tomorrow. Rough sea conditions are likely between October 20 and 22. Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted that the northeast monsoon will arrive in Tamil Nadu between October 23-25, meaning the southern state could witness an almost continuous supply of rains in the coming days.

As a result of the miserable weather, LNER rail services will not run anywhere north of Edinburgh on Thursday and Friday due to the severe weather forecast. Two London Kings Cross Services to Aberdeen will terminate at York and Newcastle, while a train to Inverness will terminate at Edinburgh. Ventusky Privacy Policy Storm Babet is fast approaching the UK with gale force winds causing a tree to fall onto a car in Maida Vale, West London LNER rail services will not run anywhere north of Edinburgh on Thursday and Friday due to the severe weather forecast A fallen tree blocked the railway between Macclesfield and Stafford, causing all lines to be blocked, resulting in CrossCountry trains running through the area being cancelled or diverted This morning Storm Babet started to sweep into the British Isles already causing disruption to travel, as warnings were put place for strong winds and flooding. A fallen tree blocked the railway between Macclesfield and Stafford, causing all lines to be blocked, resulting in CrossCountry trains running through the area being cancelled or diverted. Transport for Wales stepped in to help commuters travelling between Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly, while a shuttle bus service replaced trains for those travelling to the area. Meanwhile in Maida Vale, West London a huge tree came crashing down onto a car, while the driver was trapped inside it. Fire crews raced to the scene and managed to miraculously grab the driver out of the crushed vehicle. Gale force winds are expected along the coast of Wales and South West England, as well as in higher areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. The storm will first bring some heavy rain to Northern Ireland through this afternoon and into Thursday morning. The Met Office said people in the region can expect spray and flooding which may lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures for the duration of the yellow warning for rain, which comes into effect at 2pm and expires at 10am on Thursday. It said 'there is a small chance' that homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings. It also warned of a a small chance of fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and communities being cut off by flooded roads. If flooding occurs, there is a chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wardle said: 'Storm Babet will bring disruption for parts of the UK in the coming days, with heavy rain and strong winds likely for many. 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'As well as heavy rain, Storm Babet will bring some very strong winds and large waves near some eastern coasts too. Gusts around 70mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. Met Office warnings will continue to be reviewed as the forecast develops.' The RNLI warned the strong winds that have been forecast along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. RNLI water safety partner Sam Hughes said: 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' The Met Office said low pressure is forecast to remain in charge of the UK's weather into the start of next week, with potential for further spells of wet and windy weather.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Train expert explains after Colorado derailment,"Meanwhile, Colorado and BNSF debate responsibility for the collapsed bridge DENVER (KDVR) -- Federal investigators have released preliminary information showing a broken rail likely caused the Colorado train derailment near Pueblo on Sunday. That derailment killed a truck driver on Interstate 25 and has led to an indefinite closure of the interstate. The National Transportation Safety Board released its preliminary findings on Tuesday. Train derailment investigator Gary Wolf told FOX31 that broken rails are a common because of derailments. The rails are made of high-quality steel, but occasionally, there can be an imperfection in the rail, Wolf said. These can develop quickly or sometimes they develop slowly, and when they do, they start cracking out the railroad. And eventually, it results in the rail breaking part, and obviously, you lose continuity in the rail surface and the wheels go down and hit the ground. Wolf said railway companies use special equipment to test for broken rails multiple times each year, but he said defects can be tough to find. It is very difficult to find these defects in a rail, he said. It is the proverbial needle in a haystack that you are looking for. When you are going down the track with this ultrasonic test car, you are looking for defects in the millimeter range, and they are tough to find. Who is responsible for maintaining the bridge? Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. According to spokesperson Matt Inzeo, CDOT is aware of the statements BNSF has been making regarding ownership, saying the agency is working through every document we can find that deals with rules, responsibilities and ownership. One reason this is taking time is that we continue to encounter and need to resolve potentially conflicting information. Inzeo added: While there are a handful of exceptions, the state does not own the railroad bridges that cross state roads. For all bridges owned by other entities, they have their own inspection and maintenance responsibilities as part of using that bridge for its given purpose (railroads and utilities are the most common cases of this). And for the few railroad bridges that the state does own, railroads also conduct their own inspections. We do not have records of BNSF's inspections of this bridge.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Israel's army and Hamas blamed each other for the attack. Oil market watchers, meanwhile, began worrying about an increased possibility of oil supply disruption from the region as the prospect of a diplomatic solution became rather remote. The latest indication for this was the cancelation of a summit between YOU.S. President Joe Biden and the presidents of Egypt and Palestine, to be held in Jordan. Jordan canceled the summit on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Jordanian King Abdullah has blamed the tragedy at the Gaza hospital on Israel. With Saudi Arabia also taking a pro-Palestine stance in its recent conversations with the YOU.S., the possibility for a quick end of the fighting is fading away while the possibility of greater regional involvement appears to be rising if oil prices are any indication. A long occupation looms as the scenario that pushes Brent oil futures above US100bbl because it raises the risk that the Israel-Hamas conflict expands and potentially draws in Iran directly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar told Reuters. Clearly a widening of the conflict would bring more supply risks to a market which is already very tight, Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for Dutch ING, told Bloomberg. The most immediate supply risk likely remains around Iranian barrels. Bloomberg recalled Iran had earlier this week warned that the escalation of the conflict regionally was getting inevitable. Meanwhile, the latest GDP data from China provided additional support for prices. The country's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, booking a 4.9 annual increase and a 1.3 quarterly growth rate. Later today, oil watchers' attention will be focused on the EIA weekly oil inventory report after the American Petroleum Institute estimated a solid 4-million-barrel draw when analysts had expected a much more modest one of about half a million barrels.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

In a statement by his media aide, Isa Gusau, Zulum noted that the state government was not informed until residents intercepted the movement of the coaches. He added that all legal means will be followed to ensure that infrastructures meant for the state are not moved to any other place.

The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Last month, White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said that YOU.S. intelligence had been tracking the possibility of North Korea supplying Russia with weapons for quite some time. And the reason why...there is such an intense effort on the part of Moscow to generate this kind of support from North Korea is that we have continued to squeeze...Russia's defense industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition, Sullivan said in September. Other researchers have also documented evidence pointing to increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia following Kim's visit to Russia. The level of rail traffic is far greater than what has been observed at the facility during the past five years, even compared to pre-Covid-19 levels, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report released earlier this month. Given that Kim and Putin discussed some military exchanges and cooperation at their recent summit, the dramatic increase in rail traffic likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.

His Excellency continued that the establishment of this service is because Siem Reap Angkor International Airport is a new airport and about 50 km from Siem Reap and there is no public transport to get there, so the airport decided to operate a taxi service. He added that if you look at the transportation cost of the bus,  8 per person for a distance of nearly 50 km compared to other transport services in kilometers, the two transport services are no different As for the cost of transportation, he added that it depends on the choice of the traveler His Excellency further stated that for other transporters outside the system who want to enter the system of Siem Reap Angkor International Airport, they can register with the Transport Association to maintain order and safety for passengers at the airport.

The cable is Swedish-owned, and the operator brought it back into service within a matter of days. The description matches the Sweden-Estonia EE-S1 cable, which terminates on Hiiumaa.

The Ukrainian military had issued reports throughout the day about successful, high-precision strikes on airfields near Luhansk in Ukraine's east and in Berdiansk in the south, on the Sea of Azov, both under Russian control. Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately - ATACMS proved themselves, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Ukraine had repeatedly asked the YOU.S. administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Zelenskiy's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 190 miles (310 km). The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin. It is not clear how many ATACMS missiles Ukraine has. ATACMS are designed for deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces, a YOU.S. Army website says. A NEW CHAPTER Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a new chapter of the war had begun. There are no more safe places for Russian troops within the ... internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, he wrote on X. Russian military bloggers commented on the attacks during the day, with Telegram channel Fighterbomber saying Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS. Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS for the first time on Tuesday. Since starting a counteroffensive in June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in Russian-occupied areas, but it has failed to liberate significant territory from Russian occupation. Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern group of forces, told national television that there had been no letup in Russia's week-old assault on the devastated town of Avdiivka in the east, with Ukrainian forces repelling 10 attacks. Shtupun also said Ukrainian forces advancing southward to the Sea of Azov had registered partial success west of Verbove, one of a cluster of villages it is trying to capture. The Ukrainian military said Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter.

President Joe Biden approved a future delivery last month and told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House that the US would give Ukraine the ATACMs, without specifying when or how many would be delivered. Because of lingering US concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, for instance by striking targets on Russian soil with NATO weaponry, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range of and carry cluster munitions, which when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets, rather than a single warhead. Kyiv has also put pressure on Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, similar to ATACMS, causing debate amongst German politicians.

It would be paid over a period of four years. The aid package was adopted with 512 votes in favour, 45 against and 63 abstentions. This is a strong sign of our support and solidarity, Michael Gahler, co-rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, said. The adopted draft provides for controls to prevent any embezzlement, any waste and any corruption, Gahler added. Ukraine is to submit a reconstruction plan for the aid package, and the European Commission is to sign off on the distribution of the funds. The MEPs also proposed using confiscated assets of Russian citizens and companies for Ukraine. According to the document, the reconstruction and modernization of the country should be geared toward EU requirements for Ukraine's possible accession.

The two leaders met Tuesday evening at an event kicking off the forum, video posted by Russia's Foreign Ministry showed, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries. They then took part in a group photo with other leaders attending the summit. Putin also met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in China on Tuesday. Orban has maintained ties with the Kremlin despite widespread condemnation of Russia's ongoing war of aggression on Ukraine. In statements carried on Russian news agencies, Putin claimed that Russia was satisfied that Russia's ties with many European countries are maintained and developed. He said, One of those countries is Hungary. Hungary has opposed many EU initiatives resisting the Russian invasion of Ukraine and supporting Ukraine. The country still receives pipeline gas deliveries from Russia and has a limited exemption to EU sanctions on Russian crude oil deliveries.

In its daily update on the war in Ukraine, the ministry described the offensive as likely the most significant offensive operation undertaken by Russia since at least January 2023. Russia's attack is likely being carried out with multiple armored battalions, which are attempting to envelope the town, the Ministry of Defence statement read. It added that Avdiivka has been on the frontline since 2014. The town is a major obstacle in preventing Russian forces from their wider objective of taking control of Donetsk Oblast. The ministry suggested that Ukrainian forces were so far holding back the Russian advance. It added that Russian forces have sustained heavy equipment and personnel losses. Slow progress and high casualties have likely triggered a change in messaging from Russia, from an offensive to 'active defense,' as successfully clearing Avdiivka looks increasingly unlikely in the short term.

Blast kills hundreds at Gaza hospital; Hamas and Israel trade blame, as Biden heads to Mideast KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Around them in the grass were blankets, school backpacks and other belongings. Outrage over what many believed was an Israeli strike flared across the region, a day before President Joe Biden was due to arrive to show support for Israel and try to prevent the war from spreading. The carnage unfolded as the YOU.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas' deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hamas called Tuesday's hospital blast a horrific massacre, saying it was caused by an Israeli strike. The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often cooperates with Hamas in their shared struggle against Israel. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital at the time and that intelligence from multiple sources indicated it was responsible for the failed rocket launch that hit the hospital. Destruction at Gaza hospital increases stakes for Biden's trip to Israel and Jordan WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's efforts to tamp down tensions in the escalating war between Israel and Hamas faced a bloody setback Tuesday when, shortly before his expected departure for the Middle East, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas withdrew from scheduled meetings to protest an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike but the Israeli military said it had no involvement and pinned the blame on a misfired Palestinian rocket. Abbas' cancellation, disclosed by a senior Palestinian official, reflects an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of American influence in the region as Biden visits Israel and Jordan on Wednesday. Biden's decision to put himself in a conflict zone -- the same year he made a surprise visit to Ukraine -- demonstrates his willingness to take personal and political risks as he becomes heavily invested in another intractable foreign conflict with no clear end game and plenty of opportunity for things to spiral out of control. The high-stakes presidential trip is emblematic of Biden's belief that the United States should not turn back from its central role on the global stage and his faith that personal diplomacy can play a decisive role. War between Israel and Hamas raises fears about rising US hostility A fatal stabbing in Illinois, a gun pointed at protesters in Pennsylvania, vandalism at synagogues and harassment of staff at a Palestinian restaurant all are raising fears that the war between Israel and Hamas is sparking violence in the United States. The tensions follow a familiar pattern of crimes against Jewish and Muslim communities rising when conflict erupts in the Middle East and Americans have been killed or taken hostage. We have a two pronged threat to American faith communities, said Brian Levin, founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernadino. While it is too soon to say with certainty whether anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish crimes have increased during the war, hate crimes overall increased in the YOU.S. last year. In its annual report released Monday, the FBI estimated that hate crimes increased by 7 to 11,634 cases in 2022 compared to the previous year. With 1,124 incidents, anti-Jewish attacks were the second most reported hate crime, after anti-Black cases. There were 158 reported incidents of anti-Muslim attacks, and 92 reports of anti-Arab cases, according to the report. Civil rights organizations, however, believe that even before the Hamas attacks in Israel, crime data did not reflect reality due to a lack of participation by local police departments and internalized fear among the Muslim population, said Robert McCaw, director of governmental affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In 2021, the Othering  Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, released a study in which 85 of those who were subjected to Islamophobia said they did not report it to authorities. Republicans reject Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot, signaling more turmoil ahead WASHINGTON (AP) -- More turmoil ahead, Republicans rejected Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot Tuesday, as an unexpectedly numerous 20 holdouts denied the hard-charging ally of Donald Trump the GOP majority needed to seize the gavel. Additional voting was postponed as the House hit a standstill, stuck while Jordan works to shore up support from Republican colleagues to replace the ousted Kevin McCarthy for the job. Reluctant Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. Next votes were expected Wednesday. We are going to keep working, Jordan said at the Capitol as evening fell. It is been two weeks of angry Republican infighting since McCarthy's sudden removal by hard-liners, who are now within reach of a central seat of YOU.S. power. The vote for House speaker, once a formality in Congress, has devolved into another bitter showdown for the gavel. Jordan said after the first vote that he was not surprised and expected to do better in the next round. But the afternoon dragged on with no further votes Tuesday. Trump returns to his civil fraud trial, hears an employee and an appraiser testify against him NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump returned Tuesday to the civil fraud trial that imperils his real estate empire, watching and deploring the case as an employee and an outside appraiser testified that his company essentially put a thumb on the scale when sizing up his properties' value. Incensed by a case that disputes his net worth and could strip him of such signature holdings as Trump Tower, the former president is due to testify later in the trial. But he chose to attend the first three days and came back Tuesday to observe -- and to protest his treatment to the news cameras waiting outside the Manhattan courtroom. Star witness Michael Cohen, a onetime Trump fixer now turned foe, postponed his scheduled testimony because of a health problem. Instead, Trump company accountant Donna Kidder testified that she was told to make some assumptions favorable to the firm on internal financial spreadsheets. Outside appraiser Doug Larson said he did not suggest or condone a former Trump Organization comptroller's methods of valuing properties. It does not make sense, Larson said of the way the ex-controller reached a 287.6 million value for a prominent Trump-owned retail space in 2013. Ukraine uses US-provided long-range ATACMS missiles against Russian forces for the first time WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has quietly delivered a small number of long-range ballistic missiles that Ukraine said it urgently needed and that President Joe Biden promised last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Tuesday, saying they were used on the battlefield against Russia and executed very accurately. Today I express special gratitude to the United States, Zelenskyy said in his evening address, adding that the missiles have proven themselves. The YOU.S. has refused to discuss the delivery publicly, but officials familiar with the move also confirmed it earlier in the day. Fewer than a dozen of the missiles got into Ukraine within the last few days, said officials. Their arrival at the warfront gives Ukraine a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before an official announcement and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The delivery of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, was shrouded in secrecy, with the expectation that the first public acknowledgment would come when the missiles were used on the battlefield. That intense secrecy is a marked change from previous YOU.S. weapons sent by the Biden administration. In nearly all other cases, the YOU.S. has publicly announced its decision prior to the weapons and equipment being shipped overseas. Because of lingering YOU.S. concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (about 300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range and carry cluster munitions, which, when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead. According to a YOU.S. official, the ones delivered to Ukraine have a maximum range of a bit more than 100 miles (roughly 160 kilometers). Belgian police kill Tunisian man suspected of shooting 3 Swedish soccer fans, killing 2 of them BRUSSELS (AP) -- Authorities in the Belgian capital shot and killed a Tunisian national on Tuesday hours after they say he gunned down three Swedish soccer fans, killing two of them, and posted a video online in which he claimed credit for the attack and said the Quran was a red line for which he is ready to sacrifice himself. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive for Monday night's attack, which happened not far from where Belgium's men's soccer team was hosting Sweden in a European Championships qualifier. The match was suspended at halftime and the more than 35,000 fans were kept inside the stadium as a precaution while the attacker was at large. Amateur videos of the attack posted on social media showed a man wearing an orange fluorescent vest pull up on a scooter, take out a large weapon and open fire on people getting out of a taxi. He chased them into a building to gun them down. He was also filmed calmly loading his weapon as cars drove by slowly. Sweden's foreign ministry said the men who were killed were in their 60s and 70s, and the man who was wounded is in his 70s and remains hospitalized. Hours after the suspect disappeared into the night and a manhunt was launched, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap Are 3D mammograms better than standard 2D imaging for catching advanced cancers? A clinical trial is recruiting thousands of volunteers -- including a large number of Black women who face disparities in breast cancer death rates -- to try to find out. People like Carole Stovall, a psychologist in Washington, D.C., have signed up for the study to help answer the question. We all need a mammogram anyway, so why not do it with a study that allows the scientists to understand more and move closer to finding better treatments and ways of maybe even preventing it? Stovall said. The underrepresentation of women and minorities in research is a long-simmering issue affecting health problems including Alzheimer's disease, stroke and COVID-19. Trials without diversity lead to gaps in understanding of how new treatments work for all people. Broken rail caused fatal Colorado train derailment that collapsed bridge, early findings show A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. Prosecutors seeking to recharge Alec Baldwin in fatal shooting on set of Western movie 'Rust' SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Special prosecutors are seeking to recharge actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie in 2021, describing Tuesday their preparations to present new information to a grand jury. New Mexico-based prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said they will present their case to the grand jury within the next two months, noting additional facts have come to light in the shooting on the set of the film Rust that killed Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin, a coproducer of the film, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a rustic chapel on a movie-set ranch near Santa Fe when the gun went off on October 21, 2021, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza. Additional facts have come to light that we believe show Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza, Morrissey and Lewis said in an email. We believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of New Mexico citizens to determine from here whether Mr. Baldwin should be held over for criminal trial. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer -- but not the trigger -- and the gun fired. Newsletters Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

DENVER (AP) -- A truck driver was killed when a train derailed near Pueblo, Colorado, and caused a railroad bridge to collapse onto a major highway -- crushing the semitruck, spilling coal and mangled rail cars across the roadway and shutting down traffic indefinitely, authorities said Monday. The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East.

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. SEMITRUCK DRIVER DIES IN COLORADO AFTER TRAIN DERAILS, SPILLING CARS AND COAL ONTO HIGHWAY The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. 'BIGFOOT' CAUGHT ON CAMERA DURING COUPLE'S ROMANTIC GETAWAY IN COLORADO The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average.

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring more than a month's worth of rain and 70mph winds. The most severe conditions will hit eastern Scotland where a 36-hour amber warning will be in place from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday. Separate yellow warnings have been put in place for Northern Ireland from 2pm on Wednesday until 10am on Thursday, and across vast swathes of Scotland and northern and eastern England from 6am on Thursday to 6am on Saturday. As the storm approaches, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales.

CrossCountry said no trains would run between Exeter and Plymouth from 6.30pm today until 11.30am tomorrow because of the conditions due to hit Dawlish, an exposed part of the line where the railway runs alongside the south Devon coastline. On the Isle of Wight there were no trains at Ryde Pier Head today due to the weather, with a replacement bus in place between the station and nearby Ryde Esplanade. Network Rail said its teams were concerned by the high risk of flooding and strong winds potentially uprooting trees, with weather specialists in its control room considering whether any speed restrictions will be required in Scotland this week. WEDNESDAY: Four days of rain warnings start with one that comes into force tomorrow THURSDAY: This is when the impact based on the number of warnings in place will be greatest FRIDAY: This is the same as Thursday, apart from the Northern Ireland warning which ends SATURDAY: Rain warnings will continue to cover much of England and Scotland on Saturday The Met Office's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain. This graphic shows total rainfall over the course of the warnings from tomorrow until Saturday A Nasa satellite image released today shows Storm Babet approaching Europe last night Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. Forecasters have warned of dangerous driving conditions and 'fast-flowing and deep floodwater' that could pose a danger to life. The warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. Some of these alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During Storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days.

There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves. The heaviest rain is expected in eastern areas of Scotland, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7 to 8 in Scotland, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. Communities in Aviemore, Highlands, Argyll and Bute, and Perthshire were badly impacted October, with weather so bad it was compared to the Beast from the East in 2018. Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83, and large parts of the Scottish rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. A 36-hour amber warning has been activated from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday Before the amber alert was issued today, Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. How Babet was named after a Dutch woman born during a gale Storm Babet was named after a woman from the Netherlands who said she had been born during a gale. The Met Office compiles its annual list of storm names in conjunction with the Dutch and Irish weather services. The Dutch weather service organised an open day last year, inviting visitors to submit suggestions for names - and Babet was among those involved, reported the Daily Telegraph. Further down the list is Storm Elin, which was named after a visitor who said they had a 'tempestuous granddaughter' with the same name. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. 'Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required, and we continue to work with the Met Office to monitor the situation 247. 'Impacts from surface water and rivers are likely, and with catchments saturated from recent heavy rain and flooding, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. 'There is also concern that surface water flooding may be exacerbated by debris blocking drainage, culverts, etc as a result of the high winds. 'If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel. Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: 'A disruptive period of weather is on the way. 'There is some high totals (of rain) which have the potential to disrupt travel plans... possibility of power cuts as well as the obvious risk of flooding. 'As you look at Wednesday, the first pulse of rain is looking to particularly influence Northern Ireland, Wales and the southwest of England, and into Thursday.

He added that further weather warnings are likely to be announced by the Met Office in the coming days. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers. Sam Hughes, the charity's water safety partner, said: 'The forecasted strong winds along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' Met Office chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. 'It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'For Scotland, this rain will be fairly heavy and persistent through much of the second half of the week and into the early part of the weekend.

'Gusts in excess of 60mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. It is likely Met Office warnings will be updated through the week.' It comes after southern England experienced its first autumn frost of the year yesterday as temperatures plummeted below zero. Charlwood in Surrey was the chilliest place in England with -1.4C (29F), while the cold snap was also felt in Benson in Oxfordshire, Farnborough in Hampshire and Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the mercury fell to -1C (30F). Gatwick and Stansted airports reported readings of 0C (32F), while temperatures in the Scottish Highlands fell to -2.2C (28F). As many as 35 weather stations reported temperatures below freezing last night, the Met Office said. The last such widespread frost was 172 days ago on April 27. The RAC was fearing an estimated 20 per cent spike in callouts yesterday on what it dubbed 'Flat Battery Monday' as car motors were more likely to fail due to the freezing night. In the Republic of Ireland, Met ireann has issued orange weather warnings for Cork and Waterford as spells of heavy rain and blustery winds were expected to arrive this morning. The Met ireann warning will be in effect from 6am today until 6am tomorrow. The forecaster told residents to expect considerable rainfall combined with 'blustery east to southeast winds at times'. Storm Babet could cause poor visibility, localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide, the forecaster said. Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kilkenny and Wexford were given a yellow rain warning that comes into effect at 6am today. A yellow rain warning for Connacht will be in place from noon today until noon tomorrow, while one for Antrim, Armagh and Down will begin at 6am tomorrow and run until midday on Thursday.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The site was cleared of tons of coal and a half-dozen or more rail cars that plunged off a bridge that was torn away by the derailment. The accident resulted in the death of a 60-year-old truck driver from Compton, California who was headed north on I-25 when the truck was crushed by the debris. Following work by BNSF Railway workers to clear the mess, the Colorado Department of Transportation will work to restore the highway and re-open it. BNSF owns and operated the train that derailed. RELATED: Both directions of I-25 closed after train derails north of Pueblo With that impact, you know that there is going to be some damage. We are anticipating that and we are going to attack the problem as soon as we can so we can get drivers back on I-25, said CDOT spokeswoman Amber Shipley. The National Transportation Security Board said in a statement Tuesday that preliminary information, indicates that a broken rail just to the east of the I-25 bridge caused the derailment. The train was heading south on the east side of the highway and was about to cross over the bridge when the derailment happened. Train cars hit the 65-year-old bridge. NTSB investigators also believe the broken rail preceded the derailment and the bridge collapse occurred after the derailment, the statement went on to say. That will direct less attention to the integrity of the bridge, which showed cracks in its concrete supports in recent Google Map images before the derailment. More concerning is that there appeared to be no warning of problems ahead for the train crew. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warning systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, the NTSB said. Such systems are low-voltage electrical circuits that are an indication of rail integrity. When severed, the signal would indicate a problem. The NTSB's statement does not indicate whether a break in the rail line would have been significant enough to trigger a warning, or if the system was working. What was also unclear Tuesday was who owned the bridge. BNSF said it did not, but the state said there was conflicting information. CDOT Communications Director Matt Inzeo said the department was, going through every document that we have, to look into the provenance of the structure. He said they would reserve further comment until they could, give a definitive answer. RELATED: It could be days before Interstate 25 reopens after deadly Colorado train derailment, Polis says As the highway remained closed in both directions, drivers took Highways 50 and 115 as a detour routing them through Penrose west of Pueblo. It meant more business for places like Coyote's Coffee Den along 115. It is staying steady like this, said supervisor Wanda Massey. Traffic on Highway 50, she described was, way heavier, than usual. It meant a different experience, but one metro area residents know well; traffic jams. It takes 10 minutes to get across town.

Initial investigation into a train derailment in southern Colorado suggests the accident was caused by a broken rail, officials said Tuesday. The derailment, which took place on Sunday, sent 30 cars from a BNSF coal train off the tracks, collapsing a bridge over Interstate 25 and killing one person who was driving a semi trailer on the road. A nine-mile-long stretch of I-25, between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, will remain closed for days while crews clean up spilled coal and other debris. Authorities will need to investigate whether the spilled cargo damaged the roadway. Traffic that would normally travel on I-25 is being routed through Penrose, Colorado. Federal investigators will now try to determine what broke the rail, and why train crews did not receive warnings about the damage. SEE MORE: Train derailment closes Colorado interstate It was not known Tuesday whether the affected track had a system in place to monitor stress on track rails. Such systems can provide early warning before an accident occurs, and can stop approaching trains in the event of a track failure. BNSF had not responded to questions from The Associated Press on the matter as of Tuesday. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick told the outlet investigators would determine if the track was equipped with that system as part of their inquiry. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said.

The brazen late-morning shooting occurred on Interstate 95 near the World Golf Village in Florida's 5th district on Tuesday, causing a shutdown. Per News4Jax: According to the Sheriff's Office, suspects who were riding in the red car opened fire on a victim's vehicle on the interstate around 11:20 a.m. on Tuesday. The victim, who was driving, was struck by the gunfire and crashed into the center guard rail and a female passenger had glass-break injuries. Both were transported to local hospitals but their conditions are unknown. The red car sped off southbound and has not been found, the Sheriff's Office said.A white Mercedes was seen at the scene of the shooting surrounded by law enforcement vehicles including a forensics van. The highway's southbound lanes in the vicinity of World Golf Village were shut down until it later reopened. Rescue vehicles and over a half a dozen police cars were seen amid the pileup around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. As Breitbart News reported, Jim Jordan was denied the Speaker of the House gavel on Tuesday due to 20 Republican holdouts, including John Rutherford. The six Republican holdouts voting for Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Mike Lawler (R-NY), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-NE), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) and Don Bacon (R-NE). McCarthy has endorsed Jordan and voted for him, said the report.

Scalise withdrew from the race last week after failing to see a path to victory. He, too, voted for Jordan, it added. Democrats have largely celebrated the holdouts as a delay of Jordan's speakership bid.

Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. High levels of arsenic have been found in ash on Maui, posing a potential health risk to anyone exposed to the debris from wildfires that damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings and claimed the lives of at least 98 people in early August. The findings, along with warnings to avoid contact with the ash, were announced in a news release Sunday from the Hawaii Department of Health. The preliminary analysis of ash from the remains of eight homes burned in the community of Kula also show other toxins including lead and cobalt.

Officials expect to find similar toxins in the piles of ash there. Where Did The Arsenic Come From And Why Is It Dangerous? Arsenic is present in building materials made from sugar cane, commonly used in some older buildings in Hawaii. It is also found in Hawaii's volcanic soils. Wildfire ash is known to contain all kinds of toxins from metal, paint, wood, chemicals and anything else that might burn in a fire. But the high concentration of arsenic is of particular concern to Hawaii health officials. While the presence of these substances is not unexpected, the concentration of arsenic in particular demonstrates the high toxicity of the ash and reinforces the importance of avoiding exposure to the ash, State Health Director Dr. Kenneth Fink said. Parents Worry Air Is not Safe For Kids To Breathe Concern over toxins in the wildfire debris is one reason access to Lahaina is still being strictly monitored more than two months after the historic town burned. I feel like it is like back to COVID, where every decision you make is wrong and you are, like, putting your kids' lives at risk, Debbie Tau, who has two school-aged children, told The Associated Press. Tau worries the air is not safe for her children to breathe, and plans to keep them in a different school farther away. (MORE: 911 Calls From Deadly Lahaina Wildfire Show Residents' Terror And Desperation To Escape) School officials say they are monitoring the air quality and taking other steps to help make sure students are not exposed to toxins from the ash. The Department of Education continues to strongly believe that reopening our Lhain schools for in-person learning is critical for the well-being of our students and the community. We have been reassured that our campuses are safe for students and staff to be at based on current air quality conditions and the extensive environmental testing we have done over the last several weeks, DOE Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in the news release. No One Knows When Residents Can Return To Lahaina The Health Department says anyone in the area should take steps to limit contact with toxins in wildfire debris. It is important to remember that people can take action to minimize their exposure to these contaminants, including avoiding disruption of ash and wearing proper PPE when in impacted areas, Fink said. In addition, for people near the impacted areas, keeping surfaces clean of dust and ash and frequent handwashing will greatly reduce exposure.

Maui Mayor Richard Bissen has said it could be up to two years before people can even begin rebuilding their homes and disaster experts say it will take much longer than that to recover. About 13,000 people lived in Lahaina before the wildfire disaster.

The ministry's spokesman, Ashraf Al Qudra, estimated that at least 200 were injured. Officials in Gaza and in Israel blamed each other for the carnage. Al Qudra said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had targeted the hospital for bombing. Hamas also blamed Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that, saying, It was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the IDF. Photos of the hospital showed fire engulfing the halls, shattered glass and body parts scattered across the wreckage. Videos posted to a Palestinian paramedic's Instagram stories show first responders arriving at the hospital and taking bloodied bodies out. Looking visibly she will-shocked in a video shared with NBC News, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah said there were three artillery attacks on the hospital. Part of the roof started to fall, he said, as he was treating a patient for a jugular injury. If the hospital bombing death toll of 200-300 is confirmed, it would be the deadliest incident inside Gaza since Hamas' terror attack on Israel on October 7. Doctors Without Borders said on the X platform that it was horrified by the bombing. This is a massacre. It is absolutely unacceptable, the organization said in a statement. The World Health Organization said it strongly condemns the attack. The hospital was operational, with patients, health and care givers, and internally displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries, it said in a statement. The WHO also said Israel's orders to evacuate the north side of the Gaza Strip last week -- the equivalent of 1.1 million people -- has been impossible to carry out for al Ahli and other hospitals. Before the hospital bombing, the estimated death toll in Gaza was more than 3,000 people, with more than 12,500 estimated to be injured. Israel's evacuation orders came as it appeared ready to launch a ground invasion into Gaza, bringing scores of military equipment to the border after Hamas terrorists killed 1,400 people and wounded 4,000 people in kibbutzim, at a musical festival and in streets across the south. The situation for civilians in Gaza has grown increasingly dire as Israel continues its airstrikes and imposes a blockade of water, food, fuel, medical supplies and electricity. Those resources are now in short supply, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled south. The bombing is the latest hit to the medical community in Gaza, which is already on the brink of collapse. Hospitals have provided refuge for people trying to escape the bombardment of the besieged enclave since last week. Dr. Ahmad Moghrabi, head of plastic surgery at Gaza's Nasser Hospital, likened the medical situation in Gaza to a disaster, and said most of his patients are women and children. It is like earthquake, everybody under attack, he said in a video diary sent to NBC News on Tuesday, where he is seen sobbing at his desk. Even my child -- 3 years old, she got injured. Really, it is pitiful -- my heart. Really, I am speaking to you, I want to cry. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of general mourning for the victims of the hospital attack, according to the Palestinian news agency.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

A man was killed when the steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed onto his semi-truck that was passing beneath the bridge. He was identified by the Pueblo County Coroner as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California. Thirty cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over the interstate at 4:45 p.m. Sunday. The derailment scattered coal and mangled railroad cars across both lanes of I-25. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a news release. Both directions of I-25 are expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris from the site. HOW TO GET AROUND THE CLOSURE IF YOU LIVE SOUTH OF FOUNTAIN Drivers who may live or work south of Fountain and may be traveling toward Pueblo will be detoured to exit 110 toward Overton Road then toward Jerry Murphy; drivers will then head toward I-25 via westbound Colorado Highway 47. This access route is recommended for local traffic only, the CDOT spokesperson said. HOW TO GET AROUND THE CLOSURE IF YOU LIVE AROUND COLORADO SPRINGS If you are going south: Take Colorado Highway 115 toward Penrose and then turn east on US Highway 50 toward Pueblo. If you are going north: Exit I-25 at US Highway 50Colorado Highway 47 and travel west toward Colorado Highway 115. Drivers will then head north toward Colorado Springs. Those using Highway 115 will encounter a 12-mile-long construction project and should expect temporary driving surfaces and frequent traffic pattern changes. Impacts include only one lane being open in each direction, reduced speed limit of 45 mph and there is a width restriction of 11-feet. Vehicles over 11 feet should seek alternative routes other than CO 115: Those driving east should use US 50, CO 96 or CO 17. Those heading west should use US 50 and then use US 285.

Rachel Powell, a Pennsylvania woman in her early 40s, mother of eight and grandmother of six, was convicted on nine federal counts back in July after a bench trial. Federal prosecutors sought eight years in federal prison for Powell, saying she developed an obsession with keeping former President Trump in power after his 2020 election loss, and that she even conducted surveillance at a female legislator's home before taking part in the Capitol attack. Powell, in emotional comments during her sentencing, said she did not want there to be any doubt about what she thought of what she did. I am deeply ashamed of my conduct, she said. I regret it, and it will never happen again. Powell said she feels remorse and regret every day. My conduct was disgraceful, Powell said. I apologize to my family for the hell they have endured because of me. After pushing against a police line at the Capitol, summoning other rioters to join her and others and smashing the window on January 6, 2021, Powell used a bullhorn to try to bring order to the chaos. People should probably coordinate together if you are going to take the building, Powell yelled. In the immediate aftermath of January 6, she said it WAS F--KING WAR TO GET IN, that rioters were not f--king welcomed in and that police had to retreat into the building and fight back because patriots were relentless. But she changed her tune since, prosecutors noted, and has painted a picture of police brutality.

The report's conclusions are based on high-quality satellite imagery of ports and train shipments. If its assessment is correct, it would appear that Vladimir Putin's ingratiating hosting of totalitarian North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on a six-day visit to Russia in mid-September, complete with a 40-second handshake, has done the trick -- worrying amounts of North Korean arms are already in the possession of Russia, and Ukraine has a problem. Dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and a little-known port in Far Eastern Russia's Primorsky Krai known as Dunai, the RUSI report revealed. And, according to the RUSI analysis, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, it said, likely contained North Korean armaments. The RUSI report also cited images showing dozens of shipping containers of the same colour and size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, bordering the Black Sea. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, the imagery is said to show. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the RUSI report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they added. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Russia has denied receiving weapons from North Korea but in September White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said US intelligence had been monitoring the potential supply of armaments from North Korea to Russia for some time. Sullivan said Moscow had made an intense effort to secure this kind of weapons support from North Korea because we have continued to squeeze... Russia's defence industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition. In a report released earlier this month, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies documented evidence indicating much increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia that likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The broken rail was just east of the bridge over I-25, the NTSB said. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warnings systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, NTSB spokeswoman Sarah Taylor Sulick said in an email. The update comes as state officials are still seeking to determine who has responsibility for the bridge that collapsed. BSNF Railway, which operated the train and owned the line upon which it ran, said the bridge was owned by the state. The Colorado Department of Transportation initially said the bridge was owned by the railway, but a spokesman said Monday afternoon that the agency is now digging back through its records to determine who has ultimate responsibility for the 65-year-old structure. NTSB's investigation may last up to two years, though an initial report is expected to be released within a month.

(David ZalubowskiAssociated Press) A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said October 17, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a news release. The steel bridge built in 1958 collapsed October 15 when 30 cars from a BNSF train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away piles of coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has previously recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where the October 15 derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was under investigation. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, Sulick said. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Federal investigators late October 16 approved cleanup work along I-25 after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records October 17, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by October 18, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data that is based on reports submitted by railroads. Pressure for the industry to improve safety has grown in recent months following a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the FRA. That is just over two accidents annually on average. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit a wind energy company in Pueblo the day after the accident but postponed the trip at the last minute to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons of hot asphalt. The accident remains under investigation.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

It is revolting and dangerous to tear people apart right now with cruel poison that undermines our basic values as Americans, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to NBC News. And no one who praises Iran-backed terrorist groups has any credibility when it comes to protecting our national security from terrorist threats. Biden, and his White House, have been in recent weeks increasingly willing to engage with Trump, who remains far and away the frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. On Monday, Trump called for a new -- and more expansive -- ban on immigrants from certain countries, and for the first time, he included Gaza. As a candidate in 2015, Trump first proposed a total shutdown on Muslims entering the YOU.S. As president, he tried to enact a sweeping executive order, which was eventually limited to five Muslim-majority countries, along with North Korea and Venezuela. Biden then rescinded that ban when he took office. Following the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, President Biden has been unequivocal: There is no place for hate in America -- not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anyone. On his very first day in office, President Biden was proud to rescind the hateful Muslim travel ban instituted by his predecessor, which violates core Americans principles, Bates said, adding, After the terrorist atrocities in Israel and after heartbreaking murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American child this week -- a 6-year-old child -- this is a moment when all leaders need to come together against hate; against Islamophobia, against antisemitism. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said it was incorrect to call it a Muslim ban and it showed how stupid the Biden people are. Truly moronic. Trump has faced significant criticism -- including from within his own party -- for his initial response to the Hamas attacks on Israel. He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and praised Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group designated by the YOU.S. as a terrorist group, as very smart. Since then, Trump has chosen a different approach, being sure to emphasize that he stands with Israel and supports a harsh approach toward Hamas and anyone who might have a whiff of support for Hamas. On Monday, Trump also said he would proactively send immigration agents to pro-jihadist demonstrations in the YOU.S. to remove noncitizens and implement strong ideological screening of all immigrants, which would include a person's rejection of Hamas. Bates said immigrants already undergo extensive vetting. There is strict national security vetting to determine whether individuals coming from anywhere in the world have ties to terrorist organizations, he said, adding that no one who praises Iran-backed terrorist groups has any credibility when it comes to protecting our national security from terrorist threats. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Within the Republican field, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has fought to outflank Trump on the right of the Israel issue, first calling for a ban on refugees from Gaza and baselessly claiming that Palestinians are all antisemitic. On Tuesday, he also said he opposed sending any humanitarian aid to Gaza.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a ban on using formaldehyde as an ingredient in hair relaxers, a huge step in raising awareness about the potential harms these products create for the many Black women that typically use them. The proposed rule would ban the chemical in hair-smoothing or hair-straightening products, also called relaxers. The FDA currently discourages consumers from using hair-straightening products that contain formaldehyde and similar ingredients, according to a fact sheet from the agency. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas that is used in a wide range of household products, including medicines and cosmetics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is highly toxic, and repeated exposure can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, lungs and throat. It is also linked to certain cancers, including myeloid leukemia, a cancer that occurs in the blood and bone marrow, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even products that do not contain formaldehyde as a main ingredient may contain other ingredients that, when heated, can be converted into formaldehyde, such as methylene glycol, which is found in some hair-straightening products. Some soaps, shampoos, lotions and cleaning products contain formalin, which is formaldehyde dissolved in water. The current law does not require the FDA to approve cosmetic products and ingredients before they go on the market -- only color additives, according to the agency's website. Companies and individuals selling products have a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of their products, the agency says, but federal law and regulations do not require companies to share their safety information with the FDA. Research in recent years has helped raise awareness about the potential dangers of using chemical hair relaxers. A study published last year by the National Institutes of Health found that women who used hair-straightening chemicals more than four times in the previous year were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the products. While the study did not collect information on specific brands or ingredients used by the participants, the researchers noted that formaldehyde, parabens and other ingredients found in chemical hair straighteners may contribute to the increased risk of uterine cancer. Additional research published this month by Boston University's Black Women's Health Study -- a long-running study, launched in 1995, that tracks the health of 59,000 Black women -- found that postmenopausal Black women who used chemical hair straighteners long term had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. The study was designed to emphasize the dangers of chemical hair straighteners and help identify safer alternatives, said Kimberly Bertrand, the study's lead author and an associate professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. We know that these products are very poorly regulated by the federal government in terms of what goes in there, Bertrand said. You cannot look at an ingredient label and know that it contains these endocrine disruptors. They do not list phthalates and parabens on the box -- they say fragrance and preservative. So, women do not really know what they are being exposed to. Endocrine disruptors are often found in chemical hair straighteners and can be absorbed into the body when the product is placed on the scalp, Bertrand said. These chemicals can interfere with the body's endocrine, or hormone, system, and are linked to early onset of puberty, fibroid tumors and infertility, she added. An additional study published by the American Journal of Epidemiology in March found that current and former use of chemical hair straighteners was associated with lower fertility in women. Several Black women within the past year have filed lawsuits against Revlon, L'oreal and other cosmetic brands, alleging that the companies' hair straightening products caused the women to develop uterine cancer, breast cancer and other health complications. In other cases, women also claimed the products caused infertility. The FDA's proposed ban comes months after Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, wrote an open letter in March requesting the federal agency to conduct an investigation to determine if chemical hair straighteners contain carcinogens that lead to a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. Many Black women use these hair straightening products to adapt to societal standards as a result of anti-Black hair sentiment, the letter stated. In addition to the FDA's proposed ban, Pressley and other advocates have pushed for policies like the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, known as the CROWN Act, which prohibits employment and educational discrimination based on hair texture. Since the YOU.S. House of Representatives passed the bill in March 2022, more than 20 states have followed suit, including Texas, where a Black teenager was suspended earlier this year after school officials said his dreadlocks violated the district's dress code. The target date for the FDA's proposed ban is April 2024.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The main north-south highway in Colorado is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris after a weekend train derailment and bridge collapse, authorities said Tuesday. Federal investigators approved cleanup work after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed onto Interstate 25 north of Pueblo, Colorado, killing a truck driver. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, said Sarah Taylor Sulick, of the National Transportation Safety Board. The bridge, built in 1958, collapsed when 30 cars from the train derailed Sunday afternoon, the NTSB said. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials said the derailment caused the bridge collapse but have not said what caused the derailment. A preliminary report from investigators is due in several weeks. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records Tuesday, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo, of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit a wind energy company in Pueblo the day after the accident but postponed the trip at the last minute to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East.

Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average.

The situation at the Rafah crossing was growing increasingly desperate as massive civilian crowds were still under threat of falling bombs while unable to access convoys of water, food, hygiene items, blankets, tents, and medical supplies sitting unused in neighboring Egypt, according the United Nations. The border crossing with Egypt has been shuttered since October 7, when Hamas launched a barrage of coordinated attacks on Israel, whose military responded in an all-out siege on the Gaza Strip. After a week of fighting, tons of essential goods poured into Egypt's El Arish International Airport over the weekend from Jordan, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, before being shipped to Gaza aboard hundreds of big rigs. The World Health Organization sent medical supplies from a hub in Dubai to help those injured in the crossfire, as well as those suffering from trauma or persistent health conditions like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The YOU.N. World Food Program was also delivering food and water to Gaza, which had no fuel, electricity and limited access to clean drinking water as Israel's bombing campaign continued to pummel major population centers, reducing them to rubble. Previously, YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Israel to open a safe aid delivery corridor as Gaza was running out of basic supplies to support life. On Tuesday, Tamara Alrifai, who serves as the spokesperson for the YOU.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, urged Israel to reopen the border crossing to allow the crowds to reach the desperately needed aid. In one episode, about 6,000 civilian refugees were huddled in a warehouse in southern Gaza with little if anything to eat or drink, she told CNBC. Over the last two days, reports of about 1 million people -- that is a sea of people -- going south moved using whatever means they could and given the lack of fuel in Gaza a lot of them moved by feet, Alrifai said. So, the images we have been receiving from my colleagues are harrowing images of people on their feet walking under airstrikes and air bombings to try to find shelter in a safer area. Over the weekend, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Rafah border crossing would be reopened as Israel initiated a ground invasion into the Palestinian enclave, where more than 2 million civilians were trapped in a worsening humanitarian crisis. However, discussions to resolve the matter broke down Monday after Egypt's leadership refused to open their side of the crossing unless Israel let the waiting supplies into Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced pressure from Washington to allow humanitarian aid to come into Gaza as water and other supplies were starting to run out. But Netanyahu's office said Monday that Israel had received no assurances from Hamas on a cease-fire agreement that would allow the aid into Gaza and the refugees to seek safer ground in Egypt. Meanwhile, Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry blamed Israel for delaying the move and putting innocent lives at risk.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit vital military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear programme. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The US unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a US aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the spectre of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a US plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The US has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in the production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defence ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments have been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken and Kuleba discussed the latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The suspected because of the incident was announced Tuesday by the National Transportation Board. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Sulick said investigators believe the broken rail preceded Sunday's derailment, and the bridge collapse occurred following the initial derailment of the train. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warnings systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, Sulick said. Numerous traffic detours remain in place as crews continue to work the scene of the train derailment. According to reports from Gazette news partner, KKTV, several trucks arrived on the scene Tuesday morning, just before 8 a.m., awaiting mangled train tracks and coal to be picked up and cleared from the scene, with additional crews on standby. Local and state law enforcement officials remain on the scene, patrolling the area.

The main north-south highway in Colorado is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear piles of coal and other debris after a weekend train derailment and bridge collapse, authorities said Tuesday. Federal investigators approved cleanup work after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed onto Interstate 25 north of Pueblo, Colorado, killing a truck driver. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, said Sarah Taylor Sulick, of the National Transportation Safety Board. The bridge, built in 1958, collapsed when 30 cars from the train derailed Sunday afternoon, the NTSB said. The 60-year-old driver of a semitrailer truck that was passing beneath the bridge was killed. Officials said the derailment caused the bridge collapse but have not said what caused the derailment. A preliminary report from investigators is due in several weeks. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Meanwhile, the bridge's ownership remained unclear two days after the accident. Railroad companies typically own the bridges that trains use. However, BNSF said the steel girder bridge that collapsed onto I-25 was owned by the state. Colorado officials initially said the bridge was the property of the railroad but later backed off that claim. Officials were still combing through records Tuesday, trying to determine ownership, said Matt Inzeo, of the Colorado Department of Transportation. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration.

I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away piles of coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has previously recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was under investigation. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. There is no reason believe the derailment was sabotage, Sulick said. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Federal investigators late Monday approved cleanup work along I-25 after largely completing their evidence collection where the BNSF coal train derailed. A 9-mile stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was closed.

There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data that is based on reports submitted by railroads. Pressure for the industry to improve safety has grown in recent months following a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration.

Images and video released by the Colorado State Patrol show a semitrailer crushed under the bridge and more than a dozen derailed train cars that spilled coal across the highway. Two sets of train car wheels can be seen among the coal. BNSF, the train operator, said no injuries were reported among the crew. The railroad said it was working with authorities to investigate and clean up the site. State Patrol spokesman Gabriel Moltrer said the truck driver was fatally injured. The Pueblo County coroner's office has not released the driver's name. A stretch of the interstate, which runs north-south through Colorado via Denver, remained closed in both directions Monday. The section of highway carries about 40,000 vehicles daily. This will be an extended closure, the Colorado Department of Transportation said in a bulletin for drivers. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the derailment, with a team expected to arrive at the scene Monday. Sarah Taylor Sulick, an NTSB spokeswoman, said the investigation also will examine the bridge and its maintenance. The bridge's ownership on Monday was not clear. The state Transportation Department said it is owned by BNSF, but the railroad said it is owned by the state agency. The crossing is listed in state bridge records that do not indicate ownership. The records rank its condition as poor, a designation that does not necessarily indicate a safety risk. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday he talked to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) about the derailment, adding that officials from his federal agency were on their way to the scene. BNSF has had 177 derailments this year, according to Federal Railroad Administration data. Most accidents recorded by the FRA occur in rail yards rather than on mainlines. Also Monday, the NTSB released findings from a BNSF derailment in Raymond, Minn., this year that led to 800 people being evacuated because some of the derailed cars were carrying ethanol. Investigators found that five tank cars released hazardous materials. The March 30 derailment was caused by a broken rail, the NTSB concluded. The safety of freight railroads has been under scrutiny this year following the February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. In that case, a Norfolk Southern train came off the tracks, and officials decided to vent and burn cars carrying vinyl chloride. Black smoke billowed over the community, leaving residents concerned about their health. The Ohio derailment, which is still under investigation by the NTSB, prompted the FRA to push for stronger railroad regulations as lawmakers also vowed to make changes to safety laws. A Senate committee approved a bill in May, but it has not come up for a vote on the Senate floor. Legislation has not moved forward in the House.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

While civic officials claimed that it is leading to cost escalation and may delay the flyover project, a Metro official said one report has been submitted and others will follow in a phased manner. The PMC has undertaken the construction of the flyover -- from Rajaram Bridge to Fun Time Cinema -- to decongest the road, which is notorious for traffic jams and accidents. A total of 39 pillars of MahaMetro are coming up in the descents after the flyover. It has not submitted the report on the design of these pillars even after repeated requests. Due to this, the work of the flyover is getting delayed, Ajay Vaise, executive engineer, PMC, told Mirror. Sources in the civic body said the flyover project cost is escalating by Rs 1 crore per month due to the delay in submission of the report by the rail authorities. MahaMetro executive director Hemant Sonawane refuted the claims. We have submitted reports on the design of 12 out of 39 pillars to the PMC. The reports on the design of other pillars will be submitted in a phased manner. We are cooperating with the civic body, he told Mirror. The sources in the civic body said: Metro poles up to a height of one meter from the ground will be constructed on the routes where the flyover ends. On November 21 last year, the PMC had requested for the plan from MahaMetro as to where and how these pillars would be. After repeated follow-up, a report on the design of these pillars was given in the beginning of September this year, the sources in the civic body said. A joint meeting of PMC and MahaMetro officials was held on September 27. At that time, it came to light that the report on the structure of the pillars submitted by metro authorities was given without underground investigation. Since then, the civic body has been following up for the revised report. The construction of the flyover is being delayed due to a lack of roads to the landing site of the flyover. The material for the flyover construction is currently being taken to the bridge with the help of a lift. The flyover is scheduled for completion by March 2024, and the work is being done at 80 percent capacity, claimed the officials.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

They will also look at the adequacy of prior track inspections and the condition and maintenance history of the bridge. The federal agency will release its preliminary report within 30 days. A final report could take up to two years. The broken rail was east of the bridge over I-25, the NTSB said. Both northbound and southbound lanes of I-25 remained closed as crews continued to clear debris from the road. BNSF expects cleanup to be completed by Wednesday, when CDOT engineers and maintenance crews will assess the damage and determine what repairs are needed to reopen the highway. Drivers headed south are advised to use Colorado 115 until they reach Penrose, before heading east on YOU.S. 50 toward Pueblo. Northbound drivers can exit the interstate at YOU.S. 50 and go west, toward Pueblo West, then north on Purcell until they reach I-25, CDOT said. There still remains confusion over who owns the bridge that collapsed and who was responsible for maintaining it. A spokesperson for BNSF, which operated the train that derailed and owns the line it runs on, told The Colorado Sun the state owns the bridge. But the state told The Associated Press on Monday that the ownership was unclear and that officials are reviewing records to figure it out. It is also unclear where the train was headed. But an Xcel Energy spokesperson said the coal was not en route to the Comanche power plant in Pueblo and will not affect the plant's operations. The Pueblo County Coroner's Office identified the truck driver as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, Calif. None of the train's crew were reported injured.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Ahmad Hasaballah  Getty Images The taps in the besieged Gaza Strip are running dry, and residents are scrambling to save every last drop of water as the shortage reaches a crisis point. Dunia Aburahma said her family has rationed supplies, allowing her only a quart of drinking water per day. I have not taken a shower for four days now, said Aburahma, 22, an architecture student who fled northern Gaza with her family last week ahead of Israel's threatened ground invasion and is now living with relatives in Zawaida in central Gaza. After Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel left at least 1,400 people dead and about 200 people taken hostage, Israel announced a full blockade of Gaza, preventing food, water and fuel from entering the area, which is home to 2 million people. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Gaza and about 12,000 people have been wounded. The lack of water is so dire that surgeons at Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital have reverted to chemical disinfectants. Water pressure down in hospital to the point we cannot sterilize instruments, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon at the hospital, said in a message over WhatsApp. At the heart of the water supply issue is the lack of fuel and electricity, which powers everything from water pumps to treatment centers. Only about 10 of Gaza's water comes from Israel; most of what residents drink is drilled locally, and then needs to be treated to remove salt and contamination, said Elai Rettig, an assistant professor at Bar-Ilan University who studies environmental policy. But about 50 of Gaza's electricity comes from Israel, while the rest is generated in Gaza with diesel-powered generators. Much of Gaza's fuel is trucked in from a refinery in Haifa, and Hamas has rapidly diminished Gaza's supplies for its own use. Without enough fuel and electricity to run the desalination and water treatment plants, there is no clean water to flow through the pipes, Rettig said in an interview Monday. And so the major consequence of cutting electricity supply is not necessarily electricity, but water supply to the population, Rettig said. And that is where things can become a humanitarian crisis. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) warned in a situation report Tuesday that concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases are high given the collapse of water and sanitation services. Water remains a key issue as people will start dying without water, the group said. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday that the YOU.S. and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. Even before the current conflict, 97 of the population of Gaza had to rely on informal and unregulated private water tankers and small-scale informal desalination plants for drinking water, according to a 2021 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Direct pipelines were a luxury, and the risk of waterborne diseases was rampant. The private water tankers would load up at the nearest water station and then go around to neighborhoods. Those who are in need of water could fill their tanks, which are usually placed on the roofs of their homes. But those tankers run on fuel, which is now in short supply. And water pulled directly from the ground, which would require electricity and then treatment, is unsafe to drink. The situation is near catastrophic, Imene Trabelsi, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told NBC News on Tuesday, adding that there were already reports of water contamination, which can pose serious health risks. Trabelsi said the two main water desalination stations in Gaza were no longer functioning. Aburahma's family was among the approximately 1 million people who have been displaced in Gaza since the conflict began, according to the UNRWA. Many of them moved from northern Gaza to the south over the past several days after Israeli authorities said they would resume supplying water in the south, as a way to make people leave the north, amid an anticipated ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza City. Israel's bombardments and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people to the south have put pressure on Gaza's infrastructure, and water has not arrived to places where people need it. The UNRWA said Israel had supplied water for only three hours in parts of southern Gaza on Monday. We cannot get our clothes cleaned, said Aburahma, who is staying at a relative's house with 53 other people. Whenever I need to clean some of the laundry, I fill a bottle of the water we keep and a bit of soap to clean them on my hands. Jonathan Conricus, international spokesman for Israel Defense Forces, blamed Hamas for using goods, including fuel, that could support civilians in Gaza. The people in Gaza are not our enemies, Conricus told NBC News' Tom Llamas. We are not targeting them. Palestinian authorities say that even if Israel were to resume supplying more water, without power, it cannot be pumped to homes. For us as a water authority, if Israel pumps water, it cannot be supplied to the population due to the interruption of the electricity required to pump it, the Palestinian Water Authority told NBC News in a Facebook message. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands have fled after the evacuation order, the water pressure was so low that Rahaf Abuzarifa was using cups and buckets to collect any drops that would fall. We gave each a 2-liter bottle and each one is managing his own bottle, said Abuzarifa, 21, who is living in a house with 17 other people. Those 2 liters must last for three days, she said, adding that everyone in the family had only taken a bath once since the war broke out earlier this month.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm of rainfall and gales which, according to the forecaster, could cause a danger to life. What is an amber weather warning? For a storm to be named, it needs to have the potential to cause an amber or red weather warning on the Met Office's national severe weather warnings service in the UK, or the Irish or Dutch equivalents. Weather warnings can be issued for the following types of weather: They can be issued for the whole of the country, or just for specific areas. The latter is more common. Sometimes dual warnings are made, for example for rain and wind. There are three tiers of weather warning; yellow, amber and red. The colour a warning is given depends on a combination of both the effect the weather may have and the likelihood of damage occurring. These impacts can include damage to property, travel delays and cancellations, loss of water supplies, power cuts and, in the most severe cases, bring a danger to life, the Met Office says. Here is how each level is defined: Yellow warning: Yellow warnings can be issued for a range of weather situations. Many are issued when it is possible that the weather will cause some low level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places. Many people may be able to continue with their daily routine, but there will be some that will be directly affected and so it is important to assess if you could be affected. Other yellow warnings are issued when the weather could bring much more severe damage to most people but the likelihood of those impacts is much lower. It is important to read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning. Amber warning: There is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans. This means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property. You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact. Red warning: Dangerous weather is expected and, if you have not already done so, you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the severe weather. It is very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. You should avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities. The influence of Storm Babet will begin to be felt late on Tuesday and into Wednesday, the Met Office says, but the worst of the weather will be from Thursday through to Saturday. Heavy and, in places, disruptive rainfall will move in from the south and west, impacting Northern Ireland and much of England and Wales, it adds. As the rain moves northwards it will stall across central and eastern parts of Scotland, where it will become heavy and persistent. Strong south-easterly winds will also create dangerous conditions along the east coast of the UK, with large waves an additional hazard. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wardle said: Storm Babet will bring disruption for parts of the UK in the coming days, with heavy rain and strong winds likely for many. Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. As well as heavy rain, Storm Babet will bring some very strong winds and large waves near some eastern coasts too. Gusts around 70mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. Met Office warnings will continue to be reviewed as the forecast develops.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The record confirms that this part of the world's largest rainforest is suffering its worst drought, just a little over two years after its most significant flooding. In the morning, the water level in the city's port went as low as 44.3 feet, down from 98.5 feet registered in June 2021 -- its highest level on record. The Negro River drains about 10 of the Amazon basin and is the world's sixth largest by water volume. Madeira River, another main tributary of the Amazon, has also recorded historically low levels, causing the halt of the Santo Antonio hydroelectric dam, Brazil's fourth largest. Throughout Brazil's Amazon, low river levels have left hundreds of riverine communities isolated and struggling to get access to drinkable water. The drought also has disrupted commercial navigation that supplies Manaus, a city of 2 million with a large industrial park. Manaus is the largest city and capital of Amazonas, the state hit hardest by the drought. In late September, 55 of 62 municipalities there entered states of emergency due to the severe drought. There is no more water to go through. Navigation is over, boatman Cledson Lopes Brasil told The Associated Press. (MORE: Floating Amazon Village Sunk To Dry Lake Bed) Brasil operates in Marina do Davi port, a getaway to dozens of riverine communities, some of them with sandy beaches that attract tourists. The once bustling area is now surrounded by parched soil, with many boathouses high and dry. Manaus and other nearby cities are also suffering from high temperatures and heavy smoke from nearby man-caused fires for deforestation and pasture clearance. The drought is also the likely because of dozens of river dolphin deaths in Tefe Lake, near the Amazon River. This is a startling contrast to July 2021, when Negro River waters took over part of the Manaus downtown area. The historic flood, which also ruined crops of hundreds of riverine communities, lasted for about three months. Negro River ends near Manaus, where it converges with the Amazon River, which is called the Solimoes River in Brazil upstream from this confluence. In Brazilian maps, this marks the beginning of the Amazon, with Negro as the second main tributary. In international maps, however, the Amazon River begins in Peru. Philip Fearnside, an American researcher at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research, a public agency, expects the situation to deteriorate, both during the ongoing event and in the future with increasing frequency and severity of similar events with climate change. (MORE: El Nio October Update: Strong Event Still Favored This Winter) He said surface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is now warmer than during the Godzilla El Nio of 2015-16 and is expanding. In the Amazon, these Pacific warmings primarily lead to droughts in the northern part of the region. Moreover, a warm water patch in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean is causing drought in the southern part of the Amazon, similar to what happened in 2005 and 2010, according to researchers. The forecast is for the start of the rains to be delayed compared to normal, and for a drier-than-normal rainy season, Fearnside said. This could result not only in extreme low water this year, but also low levels in 2024. Until the rainy season begins in the basin, the situation that is already underway should worsen.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Blinken, Netanyahu and the Israeli war Cabinet were forced to hide in a bunker for five minutes before moving their meeting to an underground military command center, an indelible reminder of the fragility of life near the front lines. After nine hours of discussions, some with his Israeli counterparts and some with his YOU.S. team, Blinken emerged to say that President Joe Biden would visit Israel on Wednesday to demonstrate America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security and that Netanyahu had promised to work to secure humanitarian assistance for Palestinians. The United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza and them alone, including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way, Blinken said. That plan, whose details have not been released, represents a small but significant step in the direction of America's goals for managing the crisis -- and a personal diplomatic achievement for Blinken. For nearly a week, Biden's top emissary and longtime confidant has lived at the brink of an unfolding war in the Middle East, shuttling among seven countries over the past 133 hours as he articulates why America is supporting Israel's counter-offensive while seeking to keep other nations on the sidelines and limit the loss of civilian life on both sides of the Gaza border. Along the way, Blinken spoke with Biden daily -- every airplane ride or when we got back to the hotel, according to top Blinken adviser Derek Chollet -- to stay in close coordination. He is making a Herculean effort to stay in touch with the Arab World and trying to convince them that this is a different time for Israel, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who spoke at length with Blinken by phone Sunday night. The job of the secretary of state right now is to convince the region and the world writ large that this attack has changed the game -- that the old way of doing business died with the babies killed by Hamas -- and to prepare the Arab world for some tough times. Importantly, Graham added, he is also trying to get Israel to do all they can to minimize casualties. Blinken's charge is to make room for Israel to destroy Hamas without drawing Arab nations or their populations into the fight, which may require persuading Israel to exercise more restraint in its response than its leaders envision and convincing the Arab world that Israel is, in fact, doing that. As he spoke with Netanyahu, Israeli forces appeared to be on the verge of a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. It would be a monumental task for any diplomat in any era to contain a conflagration in the world's oldest tinder box, much less in the midst of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a massacre in Sudan. In that mission, Blinken has the confidence of Biden and top White House officials. The challenges we face in the Middle East and around the world require a secretary of State who is respected, who everyone knows speaks directly for the president, who has worked these issues going back many years, and who can get things done, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said in a statement. Secretary Blinken's deliberate marathon diplomacy across the region over the past few days is just the latest example of the great value he brings to President Biden on behalf of the American people. Blinken, who built his career as a Washington foreign policy hand with aggressive advocacy for intervention in defense of liberal democracy and human rights, is trying to restrain Middle East powers without the star power of many of his predecessors. In that way, he is reflective of a Biden Cabinet that departed from the high-profile Team of Rivals approach that President Barack Obama took in filling the top ranks of his administration with an all-star cast that included Biden, Hillary Clinton and several former governors. If Blinken has been the consummate Washington staffer, he is also something of the ideal Biden aide -- personally close to the boss, an expert in his field and unlikely to outshine the president. Unflappable and urbane, Blinken came to office with neither the medal-bedecked uniform of retired Gen. Colin Powell nor the international acclaim -- and presidential ambitions -- of Clinton. That can be a double-edged sword as he negotiates with foreign leaders who expect high-level attention from the YOU.S. and also value knowing that the secretary speaks to and for the president. Chollet said that he did not know whose idea it was for Biden to accept Netanyahu's invitation for a presidential visit, but that the secretary of state was the key player in laying the groundwork. Blinken's voice, from my perspective, was the most important because he was out here with everyone. He was on point, said Chollet, who is traveling with Blinken. He was able to get that fingertip feel of how it would land in Israel if the president visited, Chollet added. Daleep Singh, a former deputy national security adviser in the Biden White House, praised Blinken for executing a tough balancing act, noting the value his presence brings in prodding Israel to demonstrate restraint. Time is certainly your friend if you are trying to help a country think through the strategic implications of the day after -- every day allows for more thought to be put into a response, Singh said. Also, with him on the ground and the president on the way, it just increases the odds that Israel is not going to do anything that does not have alignment with the YOU.S. Foreign leaders can be sure there is little daylight between Biden and Blinken, who has no apparent agenda or aspiration for higher office, but there is also little public cost for slighting an official who does not have the global profile of some of his predecessors. Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly kept Blinken waiting overnight for a meeting in Riyadh this weekend. On Sunday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi noted that Blinken had spoken to Israelis earlier in the week as a Jew and claimed -- incorrectly and in front of Blinken -- that his own country had never persecuted Jews. I come first and foremost as a human being, a human being like so many others appalled at the atrocities committed by Hamas, Blinken responded in an apparent effort to play down the tribal appeal he had made to Israelis. Now 61, Blinken began his career as the chief foreign policy speechwriter on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton. He later served as staff director when Biden was the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as Biden's national security adviser and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration, and as the top foreign policy adviser on Biden's 2020 campaign. Friends say that background helps Blinken navigate effectively with little fanfare. It is actually a pretty big advantage, said former New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, who worked closely with Blinken in the Clinton administration and has remained a friend as their careers have crossed paths repeatedly in the ensuing decades. This is not a guy who is chasing headlines or seeking credit or worried about what his next job is going to be, Malinowski said. He is driven, and I have seen this over the years, by a very intense and intensely personal sense of responsibility to save lives in these situations and uphold a set of principles that he believes are at the heart of American foreign policy -- which is often easier said than done, especially in the Middle East. Blinken has spoken publicly about his sense of personal responsibility, as he did during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2021. His grandfather fled anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia, and his step-father, Samuel Pisar, survived four years in Nazi concentration camps. On a death march at the tail end of the war, Pisar ran away and hid in the woods, Blinken told the senators. He emerged when he saw a tank decorated with a five-pointed YOU.S. Army star, falling to his knees in front of an African American soldier. Pisar knew just three words in English, and he said them: God Bless America. That is who we are, Blinken said to the Senate committee where he had once served as the top aide. That is what we represent to the world, however imperfectly, and what we can still be at our best. Blinken's work is a manifestation of that view of the YOU.S. as a force for good, according to friends. You cannot know Tony without knowing the extent to which that family history shapes who he is, said Susan Rice, a former YOU.S. ambassador to the YOU.N. and national security adviser who worked with Blinken in the Clinton administration. He is been able to bring a clarity and a moral urgency and empathy to this work and this mission that he is on, which I hope the world sees is really human and deeply felt, Rice said. People who have worked with Blinken say that he has a rare ability to remain calm in stressful situations while also displaying empathy for those in distress. That lends Blinken credibility with his counterparts. But Tom Nides, Biden's former ambassador to Israel and onetime Obama deputy secretary of State, said Blinken's demeanor can be deceiving. I have been in the room when he was very aggressive with Netanyahu when he felt he was not doing the right thing, Nides said. People get confused between his appropriate attire, his dark tie and his white shirt. They should not misjudge his ability to have a velvet hammer in his right hand. Over the years, Blinken's worldview has often put him in a camp of Democratic foreign policy thinkers who favor using the American military to stop humanitarian crises -- either through threat or action. Blinken has written that force can be a necessary adjunct to effective diplomacy. He believes the YOU.S. did too little in confronting Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. In 2003, he helped Biden think through President George W. Bush's request for authorization to go to war in Iraq. Though Biden preferred giving Bush more limited powers, he voted with the Republican president. For Biden and for a number of others who voted for the resolution, it was a vote for tough diplomacy, Blinken told The New York Times nearly two decades later. At times, his tendency to turn to military force has placed him at odds with Biden, such as when the Obama administration struck Libya. Biden opposed that mission, which Blinken backed. When Biden sought to pull the YOU.S. out of a two-decade war in Afghanistan in 2021, Blinken pushed back privately, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Though he defended the move publicly, Blinken had resisted sticking to a withdrawal timeline negotiated by then-President Donald Trump and argued for creating more leverage with American military force, this person said. Biden and Blinken are close enough that Blinken attended the wedding of Biden's granddaughter at the White House last year. Although he has a reserved, low-key manner in public, Blinken has staked out a more hawkish stance on Ukraine than some others in the administration, according to sources familiar with the matter. During the course of the war, he has argued for sending more advanced weapons to Ukraine and disagreed with the idea that the YOU.S. should hold off on some arms shipments to avoid provoking Russia, seeing that as merely playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy. Blinken has been instrumental in Biden's successful effort to rally the NATO alliance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His response to the war in Ukraine reflects his strong belief that America has a leading role to play in the world, and that it can only succeed by working with allies. At Foggy Bottom, Blinken -- whose father served as ambassador to Hungary -- has been a reassuring presence for State Department diplomats after the turmoil of the Trump presidency, which was often at war with the foreign service. The diplomatic corps suffered an exodus of senior figures and a decline in applications during the previous administration, but career foreign service officers say Blinken has helped restore things to a more even keel. Graham, a close Trump ally, praised Blinken for taking a hawkish approach on Ukraine and said it is a benefit to Biden to have a lower-profile diplomat running the State Department. This is literally Biden's alter ego and most trusted ally running the foreign policy shop, he said. It is a secretary of state who has no agenda other than that of the president and who has no ambitions other than serving the president. And when he speaks, people know he is speaking for the president. Right now, Blinken is talking to everyone in the Middle East -- from Egypt to Qatar and Israel to Saudi Arabia. Whether those discussions prevent a broader war -- or limit civilian casualties -- remains to be seen. It is too soon to talk about results, Malinowski said. But I think this is a moment where a lot of Americans are seeing just how hard Tony works and how effective he can be in a moment of crisis.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Finance minister Rebecca Evans has told the Senedd all departments except health and climate change have had to provide savings. In the summer, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the government had a 900m gap in its budget due to the financial crisis in the public sector and he had told every minister to find savings in their department. Now the finance minister has revealed where those cuts will come. The Welsh Government has found some money via taking 100m extra from reserves; an expectation there will be 150m in Barnett consequentials as a result of decisions taken in England, a proposed transfer of 147m from capital to revenue budgets, if the UK Treasury allows; and cuts within departments. READ MORE: When the tourism tax could be introduced for holidaymakers to Wales READ MORE: Blunt response to motorhome owner's review about 'pooping dog' at Gwynedd campsite Schools budgets have however been hit with a 40m cut to its capital spending budget and there are cuts to all departments except for health and climate change. Funding for health (10.4bn) has had to go up 425m because of the huge pressures health boards are facing. Transport for Wales will receive an extra 125m and the revenue support grant which funds councils has been protected. Education will take a funding hit and in the economy brief, 17.5m has been taken from apprenticeship funding and 5.3m from the React scheme which helps people facing or who have been made redundant. The Government has come under fire from Tory and Plaid members in the Senedd. The Welsh Conservatives said the government had the wrong priorities while Plaid said it was poor management of the finances. Minster Rebecca Evans said: Since setting these plans, we have experienced record prolonged levels of inflation along with continued challenges in the fiscal context, particularly in areas such as public sector pay. As a result, overall, we are having to spend more than previously planned this year, placing unprecedented pressure on the devolved Welsh Budget. Unlike the UK government, the Welsh Government is extremely constrained by a combination of the Fiscal Framework, a requirement to balance the budget and limitations on our ability to borrow or increase tax revenue. To deal with particular pressures facing the NHS and rail, we are having to reallocate funding meaning reductions in some areas. We have taken prudent action by revisiting spending plans for 2023-2024, to enable us to balance our duty of robust fiscal management with this Government's commitment to protect core public services whilst continuing to target support to those with the greatest need, as far as we are possibly able to. The cuts by department: Education: Revenue down 74.4m, capital down 40m Finance and local government: Revenue down 28.5m, capital down less than 10m Economy: Revenue down 28.6m, capital down 36.5m Rural affairs: Revenue down 17.3m, capital down 20.2m Social justice: Revenue down 7m, capital down less than 10m Running costs for Welsh Government: Down 27.5m Health: Up 425m (revenue), no change for capital budget Climate change: Up 86.2m (revenue) down 37.7m (capital). Savings elsewhere in the portfolio will see 125m extra to Transport to Wales What the opposition say: Welsh Conservative shadow finance minister Peter Fox MS said: The Labour Government have grossly mismanaged their budget, for them to be scrambling to make cuts wherever possible shows the desperation they have found themselves in by spending frivolously on unneeded pet projects whilst Plaid Cymru have enabled them by backing every decision through their cooperation agreement. Labour continues to impose a real terms health budget cut, whilst spending 120 million on 36 more Senedd politicians, and blanket 20mph speed limits costing the Welsh economy up to 9bn. It is clear, Labour have the wrong priorities, whilst the Welsh Conservatives will continue to priorities the people's priorities. Plaid Cymru finance spokesman Peredur Owen Griffiths MS said: Poor management from the Labour government in Cardiff and an unfair funding formula from Westminster has left the Welsh Government scrambling to fill gaps in already stretched public services. Labour have been telling us since August that they have been working to address a 900m blackhole in their budget - which is almost 5 of the entire block grant for the current financial year. I am sure many will be scratching their heads as to how they have been able to find an additional 550m now. There are vast discrepancies here between the level of initial allocated funding and the actual level of spending. This raises questions over how the figures were derived in the first place.

The show features all the elements that have come to define his distinct approach to horror cranked up to 11: steely visual palettes, full-circle plotting, an intimate blend of genre thrills and family melodrama, and monologues that gush out of his characters' mouths like that scene in The Exorcist. Flanagan also seems mighty angry. Usher is an anti-capitalist revenge fantasy in which members of a Sackler-inspired family are systematically killed off in impressively diverse ways owing to its patriarch's Faustian bargain with the literal embodiment of Death. Here, the ways the Ushers meet their ends are not unlike a Flanagan monologue: intricate, elaborate, and illustrative of the character experiencing it. Not all deaths are created equal, however. Let us rank the ways. (Needless to say, major spoilers lie ahead.) 10. Roderick Usher (Death by House Collapse) After being responsible for the deaths of millions and millions, the guy gets off easy. -- Nick Quah 9. Madeline Usher (Death by Egyptian Ritual and House Collapse) Madeline is the queen bitch of the Usher family, a woman whose genius has convinced her that she deserves to be immortal. Remember the plot of that not-good Johnny Depp movie Transcendence? That is Madeline's goal for herself: to upload her consciousness into an algorithm so she can live forever digitally. It is some egotistical rich-person shit, as is Madeline's obsession with the Egyptian queen Twosret. Lo and behold, the Egyptian artifacts Madeline collects throughout the miniseries come back around in a gruesome way. Madeline's sense of self-preservation is her downfall -- figuratively when she tries to poison brother Frederick and makes an enemy of her strongest ally, and literally when Roderick kills her using the same method, replaces her eyes with sapphires, and pulls out her brain with a traditional hook tool. You are a goddess, and you are going to live forever, Roderick promises her, but the Ushers are not good at bringing people back to life; they are good at torturing them. So Madeline staggers around blind in the basement, knocking into stuff for hours, while Roderick gets to tell his side of the story -- that is insult upon injury for this woman who considered herself the mastermind behind everything the siblings accomplished. You know she hates that she died with Frederick instead of fulfilling her wannabe-pharaoh desires. Good riddance! -- Roxana Hadadi 8. Napoleon Usher (Death by Fall) Edgar Allan Poe's short stories are filled with people driven to madness by guilt, but in this case, Leo's mania is driven less by guilt and more by trying not to get into trouble with his boyfriend, whose cat Leo found mysteriously shanked to death. But it is madness all the same, and we spend much of The Black Cat watching Xbox Gatsby being tormented by the replacement cat he got at the pound -- sold by Verna, natch -- which nobody else seems able to see. Dude gets his eyeball scratched! Gnarly. After wrecking the apartment in search of the spectral feline (a reasonable response), Leo spots the thing on the balcony, and his lunge to catch the animal leads him to fall over the railing to his death. A lame way to go, frankly, and points are docked for Verna's mutilating the boyfriend's perfectly innocent cat. -- NQ 7. Tamerlane Usher (Death by Mirror-Shard Impalement) This woman is so obsessed with how people perceive her that she cannot actually have sex with her husband, instead hiring sex workers to impersonate her and sleep with him while she watches. Her vanity and her need for control are combined into a toxic stew. Death makes an easy meal of Tammy by increasingly appearing as her double and undermining Tammy's sense of self. Of course, Roderick's only born-of-marriage daughter dies in a way that nods to her deep narcissism: impaled by countless glass shards from the mirrors she smashes in a failed attempt to exorcize Death's reflection. The slow-motion scene of Tammy bouncing on her mattress, skewered with fragments from the mirror hanging above her bed? Satisfying! -- RH 6. Victorine LaFourcade (Death by Self-Stabbing) Victorine's actual manner of death is kind of a snooze, but it is the stuff around the killing that makes a wicked impression. In The Fall of the House of Usher's take on Poe's classic The Tell-Tale Heart, the phantom sound is reimagined as that of Victorine's bionic device, a light mechanical wheeze that haunts the good doctor, who has already been losing it throughout the episode. Based on the title inspiration alone, we know the ever-present wheeze probably has something to do with Victorine sorta-kind of accidentally bludgeoning her partner, Alessandra Ruiz, to death. The turn arrives when Roderick eventually discovers Dr. Ruiz's body in Victorine's apartment. She had carved it open at the chest to implant the device and left it to rot in a room for days on end. Pretty metal. -- NQ 5. Eliza Usher (Death by Illness and Buried Alive) Annabeth Gish has the least screen time of anyone on this list, but man, she makes it worth it. Following in her own Haunting of Hill House footsteps as another tightly wound, religiously faithful matriarch, Gish plays Roderick and Madeline's mother, Eliza, who is so devoted to her abusive boss, Mr. Longfellow, that she never pushes him to acknowledge her children, the result of their secret affair. Or at least she does not push him when she is alive. But then she gets very ill, refuses to take any medicine or go to a hospital, and seemingly dies in bed, traumatizing the children. Roderick and Madeline then bury her in the backyard for some more trauma. Then she comes back to life, or maybe was never dead at all, and attacks the kids before eventually strangling Mr. Longfellow and finally dying on top of his corpse. It is all very dramatic and, thanks to Gish's wide-eyed, Bible-thumping performance, slightly campy -- a pleasant accompaniment to the absurdity of watching this woman get buried alive, crawl out of her coffin, and then go on a violent rampage. Good for her. -- RH 4. Frederick Usher (Death by Rube Goldberg Pendulum Axe) The ponytail alone should be enough to communicate Fred as a pathetic character, but there is also the whole maiming and torturing of his wife, Morelle, over his torment at almost being cuckolded. His death is consistent with the vibe. Having developed a (thematically appropriate) addiction to a drug that causes paralysis in high doses, he seizes up with his dong let loose while desecrating the abandoned warehouse once operated by the family's pharma corporation, i.e., the site of his wife's near infidelity. Mimicking his voice, Verna calls the demolition crew to go ahead with the building's destruction, and while a simple cave-in would have sufficed, physics and otherworldly forces conspire to create a deadly pendulum over the still-conscious Frederick, who is forced to watch as the makeshift blade slowly descends and severs his body in half. Maximum points for creativity and contrivance. -- NQ 3. Lenore Usher (Death by ... Death) Lenore's death is not gory or bloody or gross, but this ranking is not just about bloodshed -- it is also about impact, and this killing is the saddest of all. If you know your Poe, the name of Roderick's compassionate, responsible, principled granddaughter is already a bit of a tell; Poe's poem Lenore is about the tragic passing of an angel, a young woman gone too soon. Despite Auggie's assumption that Lenore is still alive and sending Roderick texts while the Usher patriarch confesses to his children's deaths, the possibility that the only good member of the family would survive the series is too good to be true. If Death had a heart, killing Lenore just to maintain Roderick's trade of legacy for success would break it. Because she does not, it breaks ours instead. -- RH 2. Camille L'Espanaye (Death by Chimp Attack) Thank you to Flanagan for the gnarliness of this death, reminiscent of that fantastic scene in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes when experimented-on-by-humans Koba tricks and kills two men who treat him as a circus attraction. Justice comes in many forms! The same goes for the death of Camille, basically the Usher Family consigliere who has secret files on every single person she knows and who loathes her half-sister Vic. Vic is no saint either since she is rumored to be killing, abusing, and torturing apes in her medical experiments. But Camille is not trying to expose Vic because she cares about these animals; she is doing it for her own gain, which makes her fatally brutal beating by Death in the form of a chimp feel earned. That moment when Verna jumps straight up onto the lab's surgical table, then stalks across it toward Camille? The gargantuan amounts of blood smeared on the lab's floor by Camille's ripped-apart body the next morning? The CGI smile on the chimp's face when it is discovered next to Camille's corpse? It all works to make this demise very nearly the miniseries' most disturbing. -- RH 1. Prospero Usher (Death by Warehouse Acid Rain) No other death in The Fall of the House of Usher tops the second episode's set piece: a spectacular shot of nightmare fuel that rockets the body count into the stratosphere. Perry, the youngest and horniest of the Usher clan, moves to burnish his capitalist cred by founding a monetized Eyes Wide Shut-esque sex rave for the debaucherous elite at the previously mentioned abandoned chemical warehouse once operated by the Usher family's company. But cursed offspring that he is, what was supposed to be a party that climaxes with fire sprinklers dousing everyone with water turns into pure horror as the partygoers are instead showered with acid rain. As the guests are penned in by locked doors, the room swiftly transforms into an H.R. Giger tableau: gooey masses of skin-stripped bodies cover the floor, so juicy you can almost hear the squish. It is a perverse and beautiful sight made even more unsettling by the sound of Perry's dying breaths. -- NQ",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

NTSB spokesperson Sarah Sulick said investigators believe the broken rail preceded Sunday's derailment. Investigators will continue to determine the because of the broken rail and why warnings systems did not alert the crews to the condition of the track as part of the ongoing investigation, Sulick said. Numerous traffic detours remain in place as crews continue to work the scene of the train derailment. According to reports from Gazette news partner, KKTV, several trucks arrived on the scene Tuesday just before 8 a.m., awaiting mangled train tracks and coal to be picked up and cleared from the scene, with additional crews on standby. Local and state law enforcement officials remained, patrolling the area. Local and federal officials said cleanup from the incident is anticipated to take at least two days, once the process begins. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway continues to function as the primary entity dealing with the cleanup, response and reconstruction, officials said in a news release Monday. News Truck driver killed in train derailment near Pueblo identified; stretch of I-25 closed indefinitely The Associated Press and The Gazette BNSF estimates that clearing activities will take approximately two days, once the cleanup begins. As all of the entities involved determine other timeline elements, additional details and updates will be shared with the public. Semi-truck driver Lafollette Henderson, 60, was trapped under the bridge and debris and died on scene, the Pueblo County Coroner's Office said. According to Pueblo County spokesperson Gayle Perez, Lafollette's truck was the only vehicle involved in the crash. The derailed train consisted of five locomotives and 124 cars carrying coal, according to an email from the NTSB. Officials said a total of 30 cars derailed. According to an announcement from the NTSB, a team of track discipline, mechanical discipline and railroad operations specialist arrived on the scene Monday to assist in the investigation.

Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill this month that would have given grocery store workers who are laid off as a result of a merger or acquisition a week of severance pay for every year of their service. Advocates began pushing for the severance package since last fall, when Kroger and Albertsons announced plans for a massive merger. The 24.6 billion deal involving two of the largest grocery chains in the United States faces antitrust scrutiny but, if approved, it could happen in early 2024. In the Bay Area, Kroger operates Food 4 Less, Foods Co. and Ralph's, and Albertsons operates Albertsons and Safeway. The veto announced last week comes after the governor signed two other grocery worker protection bills.Newsom said he vetoed the bill -- Senate Bill 725 -- because other laws already protect these workers. He cited the state's Grocery Worker Retention law, which since 2016 has required companies that merge or buy another grocer to retain existing workers at least 90 days, and the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires companies with 100 or more workers to give them 60 days notice before mass layoffs. He also noted that affected workers could tap unemployment insurance. While the goal of limiting the disruptions caused by grocery mergers and acquisitions ... is laudable, existing law already provides protections for displaced workers, he said. The additional obligations in this bill are unduly prescriptive and overly burdensome. California could be among the states most affected by a Kroger and Albertsons merger. Kroger operates 233 stores under the Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co brands in California, and Albertsons operates 579 stores under the Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions names, according to a report by the Los Angeles research group, Economic Roundtable. Counting merger's costs In Los Angeles and Orange counties, 115 of 159 Albertsons stores are located within two miles of a Kroger store. The merger could result in 5,750 jobs lost in the Los Angeles region, according to the report. The union that represents many California grocery workers is raising alarms about the potential layoffs. The United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council said in a statement: A merger between these two companies could result in large-scale layoffs for workers, grocery stores closing down, particularly in food deserts and rural areas, increasing food costs, and a reduction in a variety of products, including seasonal, organic, and climate-friendly plant-based foods for consumers, The companies denied that, saying no frontline employees would lose their jobs, because the companies plan to sell hundreds of stores to CS Wholesale Grocers, which has agreed to maintain store jobs and bargaining agreements and may use the Albertsons name in California. Some grocery workers said they would feel more secure with legal protections. Judy Wood, a cake decorator at Albertsons who has worked in grocery stores for 36 years, said she feels let down by Newsom's veto. We were deemed essential workers during the pandemic and we stood behind our governor at that time, she said. We kept the food going to people if they needed it and we stood on those frontlines. We were subjected to COVID all the time. We were there for him during that time ... but he is not there for us now. Wood, 65, said she is nearing retirement and plans to leave California because living here is hard on her 21.02 hourly pay. 'Essential heroes' State Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, the Los Angeles Democrat who authored SB 725, said the governor's veto is disappointing. Without our bill, it leaves essential workers vulnerable to a potential merger, as a vast majority of these workers are already struggling to make ends meet for their families, she said. Hours before the veto, the United Food and Commercial Workers praised Newsom for signing two companion bills to strengthen protections of grocery store workers. Assembly Bill 853 will require grocery or drug store companies to notify the state attorney general 180 days before finalizing a proposed merger or acquisition, and to submit an impact analysis of the deal. The analysis would include effects on community food deserts, prices, the supply of experienced grocery workers, as well as unemployment, wages and benefits. Grocery workers have seen the effects of mergers and acquisitions in the industry -- from job loss to centers of their communities going dark, said Todd Walters, president, UFCW Local 135 in a statement. AB 853 will give California's decision makers the information needed to know just how proposed mergers in the grocery and drug-retail industries will affect their lives and can make an informed decision on the impact of mergers on our state. AB 647 will strengthen the state's existing Grocery Worker Retention Law, expanding its 90-day retention provision to include warehouse workers. And it includes stronger enforcement mechanisms, including giving grocers 33 days to resolve a violation before a worker can sue. Mark Ramos, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council, said he is grateful Newsom signed the two bills but worries the veto will mean displaced workers will not have enough money if the merger goes through.

A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. The NTSB has long recommended that railroads install more automatic monitoring systems that can detect problems with tracks early on and prevent accidents. The agency repeated its call for those systems in July in response to a fatal Amtrak derailment along BNSF-owned tracks in northern Montana two years ago. It was not immediately known whether the track where Sunday's derailment occurred had such a system. NTSB spokesperson Sarah Taylor Sulick said that was part of the investigation. They will be pulling maintenance records. They will be interviewing people involved. They will be talking to the railroad. They will be talking to the state, Sulick said. Representatives of BNSF did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Former NTSB investigator Russell Quimby said an automatic warning system likely was in place in Colorado because the accident happened along one of BNSF's main routes between Denver and Texas, where the railroad is headquartered and which has numerous coal-burning power plants. Those systems are integrated into the track and built so that if a rail breaks, they would stop any approaching trains, Quimby said. However, if the rail broke as the train was traveling over it, there would be little the engineer on board could do, since it can take over a mile to stop a fully loaded freight train, he said. The most stress you are going to have on that rail is when something is sitting on it. A fully loaded rail car, it is putting over 15 tons of pressure on the track per wheel, he said. Railroads regularly inspect their tracks, looking for cracks or other defects in the rails that could make them more susceptible to breaking. Repairs are scheduled based on the severity of the defect, so even if a problem had been identified, it might not have been fixed immediately. BNSF has not said when it last conducted an inspection or responded to requests to view its inspection records. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down. Traffic was being detoured around the derailment site and through the town of Penrose, almost 30 miles west of Pueblo. Hundreds of tons of coal and mangled railcars that landed on I-25 were expected to be cleared from the road by Wednesday afternoon, officials said. After that, officials will be able to assess how badly the road is damaged and what repairs are needed. The truck driver killed was Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California, said Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter. Pressure for the railroad industry to improve safety has grown since a February derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals that triggered evacuations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the YOU.S. in the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads. Since 1976, at least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of derailment reports submitted by railroads to the Federal Railroad Administration. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The accident remains under investigation.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said a few hours before Biden was set to take off that the trip would be rescheduled.

Crews are working to clear toppled train cars and spilled coal at the the derailment site near the city of Pueblo, which lies about 45 miles south of Colorado Springs, the Colorado State Patrol said. The train operator, BNSF Railway, said its personnel are assisting in the cleanup. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has begun its investigation at the scene, where 30 train cars derailed and caused a partial bridge collapse. Images of the scene posted online by the state patrol show several cars toppled over the side of the bridge and nearby embankment, blanketing the ground with coal. A semi-tractor trailer passing underneath the bridge at the time of the collapse became trapped between the bridge and coal cars, the federal agency said Monday. The male driver of the truck was killed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler told CNN. No other details on the victim were provided. There were no reported injuries among BNSF crew members, the rail company said. The interstate closure extends approximately 12 miles beginning at Exit 100B in Pueblo and extending northward to Exit 110, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. Both northbound and southbound lanes remained closed as of Monday evening. This will be an extended closure. Drivers heading between Pueblo and Colorado Springs must detour, the transportation department said in a closure notice. The National Transportation Safety Board said a preliminary investigation report is expected to be completed within 30 days. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said he has communicated with Colorado Governor Jared Polis about the incident and has been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway Administrations. US Department of Transportation staff were headed to the scene Sunday night, he said. State  local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected, Buttigieg said.

Two major container carriers - CMA CGM and Maersk - have advised customers that direct service to the port of Manaus is suspended until further notice. The port, the main transport hub for the upper Amazon basin, ison the Rio Negro, near where it meets the Solimoes River to form the Amazon. Monday's reading on the port's website shows the lowest water level since records were established in 1902, with the water still receding further. Some communities further up the river are virtually cut off from transport services as the water has become too shallow for navigation. A barge that was moving trucks and empty gas tanks has been stuck on a sandbank since last month. The federal government has set up a task force to mitigate the impact of the severe droughthitting the region, and move emergency supplies of water, food and medicine to the affected communities. It has also allocated BRL41m (8.2m) for dredging to re-enable navigation on the river. However, the state government of Amazonas is preparing for what is believed to be the worst drought the region has experienced. and it is exacerbated by the El Nio phenomenon and by the warmer waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which produce air currents that obstruct the formation of rain clouds. According to one report, as many as 90 of the regular vessels on the river are now operating with some kind of restriction in Amazonas, and the state has called for cargo capacity to be halved. This is affecting the movement of supplies to the region and its exports, from grain to mobile phones and other consumer electronics produced in the large free trade zone in Manaus. And officials have warned of possible disruptions to grain exports. On Friday, CMA CGM alerted customers that the conditions have reached an alarming level, limiting container vessel accessto the port. It added: As a result, CMA CGM has no other option than to divert its vessels on the Manaus Shuttle Service to other ports. Vessels would instead discharge cargo for Manaus and Vila do Conde at the ports of Pecem and Fortaleza. Earlier the container line had announced a lowwater surcharge in Manaus from 25 September of 750 per teu, rising to 1,100 per teu from 25 October. Marsk has also informed its clients of contingency plans to cope with the worsening conditions on the Amazon. It said: Our feeder provider Alianca declared force majeure, and the cargo on board vessels bound for Manaus will be discharged in alternative ports. And the container lines cannot make predictions when cargo can return to Manaus.CMA CGM said: The weather conditions that generated these restrictions are unstable, which does not allow us to accurately provide a forecast of improvement. Cargo onboard these vessels will be shipped to Manaus as soon as the water level allows. As water levels were still declining yesterday, there seems little hope of improvement in the near future. Observers expect the drought to last longer than usual, pointing to adverse weather and smoke from wildfires in the Amazon region. Some predictions are for the rainfall deficit in the region to last until the latter half of December,possibly into next year. This raises the possibility of further shipping restrictions in the area, which would send freight rates higher still. For now, Maersk offers a limited alternative transport option that combines truck and barge service between Vila do Conde and Manaus. This does not apply to hazardous and refrigerated cargo.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The report, published on October 16 by the London-based Royal United Services Institute, is based on high-quality satellite imagery surveying ports and train shipments. It adds further evidence to accusations made by the United States and other Western countries that Pyongyang has been helping Russia rebuild its weapons stocks. More than 18 months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has already ramped up its military industrial infrastructure, retooling factories and supply lines to bolster production of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for the war effort in Ukraine. But Russian forces are believed to have struggled to keep up with the furious rate of fire of some important weaponry, such as artillery shells. This summer, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to North Korea in what Western officials said was likely a negotiation to acquire armaments from Pyongyang. Weeks later, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare trip abroad, traveling by train to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and to tour Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome, where satellites and other Russian rocketry are launched. According to the London institute, known as RUSI, dozens of satellite images taken in recent months appear to show two Russian-flagged cargo ships moving between Rajin, a port on North Korea's eastern coast and an obscure port in Russia's Primorye region known as Dunai. According to RUSI's account, the ships transported hundreds of containers that, the institute said, likely contained North Korean armaments. One of the cargo ships is alleged to have ties to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it, along with a Russian maritime leasing company, were sanctioned by the United States last year. RUSI said the images also show dozens of shipping containers of the same color and same size arriving weeks later in Tikhoretsk, in Russia's Krasnodar region, nearly 10,000 kilometers to the west of Primorye. An ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk has been expanded noticeably since August, according to the imagery. North Korea's supplying of significant quantities of munitions to Moscow will have profound consequences for the war in Ukraine, the report's authors wrote. For the Russians, a major North Korean supply line will alleviate shortages of munitions, they said. Ukraine and its supporters will also have to contend with this new reality, potentially escalating their support by providing additional quantities of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's defenders. Last month, White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said that YOU.S. intelligence had been tracking the possibility of North Korea supplying Russia with weapons for quite some time. And the reason why...there is such an intense effort on the part of Moscow to generate this kind of support from North Korea is that we have continued to squeeze...Russia's defense industrial base, and they are now going about looking to whatever source they can find for things like artillery ammunition, Sullivan said in September. Other researchers have also documented evidence pointing to increased rail traffic between North Korea and Russia following Kim's visit to Russia. The level of rail traffic is far greater than what has been observed at the facility during the past five years, even compared to pre-Covid-19 levels, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report released earlier this month. Given that Kim and Putin discussed some military exchanges and cooperation at their recent summit, the dramatic increase in rail traffic likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Whether it is through interactions with guests, or by offering his personal take on a story, Madeley is known to audiences for expressing himself in an unfiltered manner. Viewers are quick to share their thoughts on Madeley's most eyebrow-raising moments on social media. Here is a rundown of his most controversial moments so far. 'Appalling' discussions on Israel-Hamas war Madeley sparked intense backlash on social media on 17 October, when he asked a British-Palestinian Liberal Democrat MP if she had any indication of Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel before it unfolded. Hamas's shock attack on 7 October killed more than 1,300 Israelis, as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore vengeance on the militant group. Israel has retaliated with relentless airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas, killing more than 2,750 Palestinians as of Monday (16 October). The Lib-Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the escalating conflict in the Middle East. GMB viewers accused Madeley of appalling behaviour when he asked Moran: With your family connections in Gaza, did you have any indication of what was going to happen 10 days ago ... was there any word on the street? Moran appeared taken aback by Madeley's question before replying she was as surprised by the attack as anyone else. Audiences called for Madeley to apologise to Moran or be taken off-air, one day after he compared civilian deaths in Gaza to those in Nazi Germany. During a GMB episode on Monday, he asked his co-host Susanna Reid if it was fair to draw a parallel between the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, with those of German civilians during the Second World War. Not just the holocaust, but with what the allies, the British, the free French did when they invaded Europe in 1944 and defeated the Nazis by going into Germany and in doing so, by going into Germany, apart from the bombing campaigns that the RAF and the American airforce launched, lots of German civilians were killed, Madeley said. Comparing climate activists to paedophiles Madeley's most recent moment of controversy took place on 28 March during a conversation about the decision of a group of Britain's top lawyers to refuse to prosecute climate activists. If these people, these barristers and lawyers, have announced they will not prosecute - they simply will not even get started in a court of law - someone who has glued themselves to the road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest, are they still happy to defend, say, a paedophile? Madeley asked. Some viewers expressed their disdain for his comments online, with one writing: Note to Richard Madeley - if you do not have anything sensible to say please do not say anything. Madeley was passionate in his questioning of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) leader, and pressed Lynch on the timing of the strikes. Why could not you have put all these strikes in January? Madeley asked Lynch. Why do you have to target people at Christmas? You will be putting people out of business who run hotels, who run restaurants, who run bars, and retail. Well, we are not targeting Christmas, Lynch replied. It is not Christmas yet, Richard. I do not know when your Christmas starts, but mine starts on Christmas Eve. Viewers were less than impressed with Madeley's conduct in the conversation, with one online commenter tweeting: Richard Madeley needs to calm down and let other people speak. A lot of the public stand with the rail strikers and nurses etc. Shamima Begum and Hitler Youth comments During a discussion on whether former Isis bride Shamima Begum should be allowed to return to the country, Madeley went off on a tangent about the Second World War. Obviously, we had the Nuremberg trials after the war and we hanged quite a few Nazis and imprisoned a lot of others and we let them out eventually. But we did not go after the Hitler Youth as far as I am aware. We did not go after the Hitler Youth - we only went after adults who served in the Hitler regime. And that is something to reflect on, I think. Susanna Reid appeared to be baffled by her co-host's reflections, and it led to some viewers comparing him to Alan Partridge, Steve Coogan's bumbling broadcaster character. Debating with Dr Hilary about Covid lockdown restrictions In July 2021, Madeley clashed opinions with Dr Hilary Jones, a longtime contributor to the programme, over their differing views on lockdown restrictions. The GP claimed that the UK should take rising Covid-19 cases more seriously - as Australia was at the time - rather than abandoning restrictions altogether. However, Madeley opposed Dr Jones's caution, telling him: But we have the vaccine and Australia has not. When Hilary explained that vaccines did not provide 100 per cent protection, Madeley said that he was being misleading.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

No further injuries were reported and the victim refused further medical treatment, police said. The NYPD Hate Crimes Unit is investigating. Police shared photos of the suspect, described as a man between 25 to 35 years old, with a dark complexion, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with brown eyes and black hair, wearing blue jeans and sneakers. The Sikh Coalition, a national Sikh faith organization based in New York, said it was in contact with the victim and offering him support. We thank allies from across all communities who have spoken out, and urge vigilance for all given the current climate -- especially given the heartbreaking recent news out of Illinois, the organization said in a statement, citing the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in suburban Chicago, which authorities have described as an anti-Muslim attack. As we stand alongside our allies from all communities, we will continue to insist that no one should have to fear for their personal safety while simply existing in public, The Sikh Coalition said. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Mark Stewart has said that the department has seen some recent hate crimes in the city fueled by the Israel-Hamas war and tensions in the Middle East, NBC New York reported. We do not tolerate it, Stewart said. We do not condone it.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Sunday afternoon incident sent train cars and coal falling onto the highway, killing a 60-year-old truck driver and closing I-25 indefinitely in both directions -- potentially for longer than a week. It may take up to two years for investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board to complete their work and release a final because for Sunday's derailment and bridge collapse, though an initial report should be released within a month, the NTSB said. The interstate cannot be cleaned up or reopened until investigators finish their on-site inspection, state and federal officials said Monday. That process is expected to take at least several days. In an interview, Shailen Bhatt, the leader of the Federal Highway Administration and a former head of the Colorado Department of Transportation until 2017, reiterated a state timeline that the closure could extend for days to weeks. Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that state officials' immediate priority is safely getting the highway open both ways, but he cautioned the reopening would take time, given that the NTSB was in control of the site. (For the most up-to-date information on local and regional traffic detours, travelers should check CDOT's website and social media as well as cotrip.org.) The safety board said in a statement Monday afternoon that the derailment of the BNSF Railway-operated train caused the bridge to partially collapse, crushing the semi-truck and killing its driver. Thirty rail cars on the 124-car train derailed, spilling coal and debris across the interstate about four miles north of Pueblo. CDOT said six or seven train cars landed on the highway itself. Once the NTSB's initial field work is complete, it may take crews another two days to fully clear the debris, Polis said. A long line of trucks were arrayed near the scene Monday afternoon, waiting to begin clearing the scene. One driver said he would been waiting since midnight. Just being down here, you see all of the coal from the overturned train cars -- it is a significant recovery effort, Bhatt said of the work to come. Polis' statement expressed condolences for the truck driver and his family. The Pueblo County Coroner's Office on Monday identified the driver as Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, California. The governor said he had spoken with YOU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and that the state was prepared to move as quickly as possible to reopen I-25 once given the green light. Our administration has been working for months to position Colorado to take advantage of the safety and rail investments that Congress and President Biden made possible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Polis said. Sadly, those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, but it is clear that federal funds for rail support are critical for Colorado. Questions remained Monday about who owned the rail bridge and who had inspection and oversight authority for it. The bridge did not have an official name, according to Sarah Sulick, a spokeswoman for the safety board. Initially, state officials said it was owned and operated by BNSF, which owns the train that derailed. Railroads typically own, inspect and maintain the tracks and bridges over which their trains run, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, with rail bridges numbering in the tens of thousands across the United States. The railroad administration also said BNSF owned the line. But the company told The Denver Post that the state owns the bridge, as did Bhatt, the federal highway administrator. CDOT spokesman Matt Inzeo said the agency still was trying to confirm who had responsibility for the bridge, noting that staff were digging through records going back to its construction in 1958. He confirmed that the state inspected the bridge in 2022, though he said the structure was not covered by federal rules requiring regular inspections. The bridge was a 188-foot-long, 14-foot-wide steel girder bridge, according to CDOT. Jaime Horowitz, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents at least one crew member on the derailed train, said he could not comment Monday because the union is part of the federal investigation team. There have been 11 train derailments in Colorado this year, all involving BNSF, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. The Texas-based railway and competitor Union Pacific together operate the vast majority of Colorado's more than 2,800 miles of railroad. BNSF has had 177 derailments nationwide so far in 2023, federal data shows. Company spokeswoman Kendall Kirkham Sloan wrote in an email that the state owned the collapsed bridge but declined to comment further, beyond providing a statement confirming the derailment and the subsequent investigation. Bhatt said the White House had been informed of the derailment and interstate closure. Asked about potential causes, he deferred to the federal investigators, who are interviewing witnesses and reviewing video recordings. I would just say that this is being tracked at the highest levels, he said, and we are very aware of the national impacts of a closure of an interstate, but also the local impacts to Pueblo and other communities down here. The derailment comes as legislators here are taking a closer look at railroad safety and oversight in the wake of a February train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, that sparked a large fire and raised concerns about hazardous chemicals aboard. Two weeks ago, state lawmakers on the Transportation Legislation Review Committee approved a bill that would cap the length of trains in Colorado at 8,500 feet, require operators to maintain safety detectors and allow crew members to report safety concerns. Commercial rail incidents have become more frequent and with increased severity over the last decade, said Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat. And I think we are overdue for taking action to mitigate that, to put some safeguard into the commercial rail transportation network.

Ford, who has been a part of UAW negotiations since 1982, pleaded with union members and leaders to work with the company, instead of against it, to reach a tentative deal to end to this acrimonious round of talks. Such comments by the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford are uncharacteristic during contract talks with the UAW. We are at a crossroads, Ford said during a news conference at the company's massive Rouge Complex in metro Detroit. Choosing the right path is not just about Ford's future and our ability to compete. This is about the future of the American automobile industry. Ford, ahead of speaking on stage, told reporters he wanted to elevate the conversation about the contract negotiations. Ford said he did not want to get personal in his remarks because it does not matter at this point. The UAW's leaders have called us the enemy in these negotiations. But I will never consider our employees as enemies. This should not be Ford versus the UAW, Ford said. It should be Ford and the UAW vs. Toyota and Honda, Tesla, and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home. UAW President Shawn Fain countered Ford's plea by ratcheting up the pressure. Bill Ford knows exactly how to settle this strike. Instead of threatening to close the Rouge, he should call up Ford CEO Jim Farley, tell him to stop playing games and get a deal done, or we will close the Rouge for him, he said in a statement. It is not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It is autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed. If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits. Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy -- they are the UAW members of the future. Ford did not threaten to close the Rouge Complex in his remarks. He did mention if American carmakers such as Ford lose to the competition, then jobs, future investments and factories like the one we are in today will be lost. Ford's remarks come after a week of contentious talks between the company and the UAW, including the union unexpectedly announcing a strike Wednesday night at the company's highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant. More than 19,000 of Ford's 57,000 UAW members are currently impacted by the strike, including more than 16,600 striking workers. Another roughly 2,480 employees have been laid off as a result of the work stoppage. Ford last week said it was at the limit of what it can offer the UAW in terms of economic concessions. The company's most recent proposal included 23 to 26 wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health-care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments; and other benefits. Overall, only about 34,000 YOU.S. autoworkers with the companies -- or roughly 23 of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers -- are currently on strike. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. Fain last week said the union has entered a new phase of the targeted strikes in which it would no longer pre-announce the work stoppages, as it had been. Fain has said it is ultimately up to the members to decide when the strike ends, not UAW leadership. Opinions of the strike and current contract proposals varied on picket lines Monday outside Ford's nearby Michigan Assembly Plant, which was the first of three facilities to go on strike last month. I trust Shawn Fain, said Latosha Smith, a four-year worker at the plant. All the steps he is taken, it is for the because. Tamika Genus, a worker at the plant for roughly five years, said of course she would like it to come to a resolution, but it is worth it. She later added, We are doing what we have got to do. Jeff Nichol, a body shop worker at the plant who was laid off due to the strike, said he wishes that the sides would come to a conclusion a lot sooner than later. He also would like union leaders to be more transparent regarding exact details of the company's proposals. Nichol, who is been autoworker for over 11 years, said he knows it is an unpopular opinion, but he would support Ford's current proposal, including a 23 wage increase. What I have been getting is good enough, so any little bit of extra does help, especially with the current economy, he said. The way I look at it, too, is the amount of time that we are off, that also plays into how long it is going to take for us to make a difference for the amount of money that we lose every single week. Ford said Friday employees who have been on strike since Sept. 15 have on average lost about 4,000 in pretax income through four weeks of the strike.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The UK's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain and gale-force winds that could bring widespread flooding and pose a 'danger to life'. Forecasters said the most severe conditions will hit eastern Scotland where a 36-hour amber warning has been activated from 6am on Thursday until 6pm on Friday. Yellow weather warnings are in force for much of the rest of the UK from tomorrow until Saturday morning, but the alert level could even reach red in parts of Scotland. As the storm approaches tonight, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. Travel disruption is also expected across the UK - with National Rail already saying CrossCountry and Great Western Railway services between Exeter, Paignton and Plymouth are likely to be disrupted from 5.30pm today due to the severe weather. CrossCountry said no trains would run between Exeter and Plymouth from 6.30pm today until 11.30am tomorrow because of the conditions due to hit Dawlish, an exposed part of the line where the railway runs alongside the south Devon coastline. Network Rail said its teams were concerned by the high risk of flooding and strong winds potentially uprooting trees, with weather specialists in its control room considering whether any speed restrictions will be required in Scotland this week. The Met Office's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain. This graphic shows total rainfall over the course of the warnings from tomorrow until Saturday A Nasa satellite image released today shows Storm Babet approaching Europe last night Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. The warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. Some of these alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During Storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days.

There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves. The heaviest rain is expected in eastern areas of Scotland, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7 to 8 in Scotland, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. Communities in Aviemore, Highlands, Argyll and Bute, and Perthshire were badly impacted October, with weather so bad it was compared to the Beast from the East in 2018. Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83, and large parts of the Scottish rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive.

How Babet was named after a Dutch woman born during a gale Storm Babet was named after a woman from the Netherlands who said she had been born during a gale. The Met Office compiles its annual list of storm names in conjunction with the Dutch and Irish weather services. The Dutch weather service organised an open day last year, inviting visitors to submit suggestions for names - and Babet was among those involved, reported the Daily Telegraph. Further down the list is Storm Elin, which was named after a visitor who said they had a 'tempestuous granddaughter' with the same name. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. 'Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required, and we continue to work with the Met Office to monitor the situation 247. 'Impacts from surface water and rivers are likely, and with catchments saturated from recent heavy rain and flooding, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. 'There is also concern that surface water flooding may be exacerbated by debris blocking drainage, culverts, etc as a result of the high winds. 'If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel. Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: 'A disruptive period of weather is on the way. 'There is some high totals (of rain) which have the potential to disrupt travel plans... possibility of power cuts as well as the obvious risk of flooding.

He added that further weather warnings are likely to be announced by the Met Office in the coming days. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers. Sam Hughes, the charity's water safety partner, said: 'The forecasted strong winds along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. 'The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. 'If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' Met Office chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. 'It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'For Scotland, this rain will be fairly heavy and persistent through much of the second half of the week and into the early part of the weekend.

'Gusts in excess of 60mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. It is likely Met Office warnings will be updated through the week.' It comes after southern England experienced its first autumn frost of the year yesterday as temperatures plummeted below zero. Charlwood in Surrey was the chilliest place in England with -1.4C (29F), while the cold snap was also felt in Benson in Oxfordshire, Farnborough in Hampshire and Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the mercury fell to -1C (30F). Gatwick and Stansted airports reported readings of 0C (32F), while temperatures in the Scottish Highlands fell to -2.2C (28F). As many as 35 weather stations reported temperatures below freezing last night, the Met Office said. The last such widespread frost was 172 days ago on April 27. The RAC was fearing an estimated 20 per cent spike in callouts yesterday on what it dubbed 'Flat Battery Monday' as car motors were more likely to fail due to the freezing night. In the Republic of Ireland, Met ireann has issued orange weather warnings for Cork and Waterford as spells of heavy rain and blustery winds were expected to arrive this morning. The Met ireann warning will be in effect from 6am today until 6am tomorrow. The forecaster told residents to expect considerable rainfall combined with 'blustery east to southeast winds at times'. Storm Babet could cause poor visibility, localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide, the forecaster said. Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kilkenny and Wexford were given a yellow rain warning that comes into effect at 6am today. A yellow rain warning for Connacht will be in place from noon today until noon tomorrow, while one for Antrim, Armagh and Down will begin at 6am tomorrow and run until midday on Thursday.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Ukrainian Special Forces said nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher and other equipment had been destroyed, runways had been hit, and heavy losses had been inflicted on Russian forces. Russia's Defence Ministry did not mention the attacks. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region which is partly controlled by Moscow, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defences had ensured the attack on the Berdiansk airfield was not successful. But a number of Russian military bloggers reported the attacks, and the Russian Telegram channel Fighterbomber said Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv and the Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS at Russian forces for the first time on Tuesday. Kyiv has been seeking the missiles to enhance its ability to attack supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory but has not confirmed receiving them. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made no direct mention of the overnight attacks but said after meeting military chiefs: Thanks also to those who powerfully destroy the logistics and bases of the occupiers on our land. There are results. I thank some of our partners: effective weapons, as we agreed, he said. UKRAINIAN COUNTEROFFENSIVE Since starting a counteroffensive in early June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in areas Russian forces occupy in Ukraine. The counteroffensive has made only gradual gains through vast Russian minefields and heavily entrenched Russian positions, and Kyiv says Moscow is attacking in some areas ahead of the second winter since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter, and that fighting continued around the town of Avdiivka on the eastern front. Kyiv says its forces are holding their ground, including around Avdiivka and Kupiansk. The Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, said in its latest report on the conflict that Moscow had made only limited gains in the area around Avdiivka and that the pace of its advance there had slowed.

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges.

A yellow weather warning has been issued by the Met Office, with roads and public transport set to be badly affected by the conditions. Here is everything you need to know as the storm approaches... A yellow weather warning covers the whole of Ayrshire from 6am on Thursday through until 6am on Saturday. The original warning, issued on Monday, was in place from Wednesday, October 18, but this has since been revised. Spray and flooding will develop on roads, with potential disruption to journey times and some areas prone to flooding could be badly affected. The Met Office said: While there is still some uncertainty in detail, there is the potential for periods of heavy, prolonged and potentially disruptive rainfall to develop on Thursday and perhaps continue into Saturday across parts of the area. Widely 20 to 40mm of rain is expected, but some upland areas of northern England and Scotland could see as much as 70-100 mm of rain. A separate amber warning is in place for parts of eastern Scotland where higher rainfall amounts are likely to cause greater impacts. The rain will be accompanied by very strong southeasterly winds across parts of Scotland, which could exacerbate impacts. The BBC says persistent and heavy rain will be most extreme in central and eastern Scotland. Train services could be severely affected by the incoming weather, with Network Rail planning ahead for potential disruption on the network. Strong winds could cause wave overtopping along the Ayrshire coastal line, which could disrupt services between Glasgow, Ardrossan and Largs.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said a few hours before Biden was set to take off that the trip would be rescheduled.

The Minnesota candy-man was having limited success with his Mar-O-Bar. The chocolate-coated whipped cream confection was too fragile to travel far and looked destined to join previous failures. As he sat with his son Forrest at a Minneapolis diner, the younger Mars had an idea that would change their lives -- and candy -- forever: Why not make a candy bar version of a malted milkshake? One hundred years ago, in 1923, the first Milky Way bar was made and sold in Minneapolis. Within a year, sales reached 800,000 -- the equivalent of more than 14 million in today's dollars. Not bad for a 5-cent candy bar -- which, to be clear, was named after the popular milkshakes of the time, not the galaxy. People are also reading...

He launches this bar and starts advertising a chocolate malted milk in a candy bar. He is making that connection with consumers. From a warehouse dubbed the Nougat House, the company that became Mars Inc. quickly grew to employ hundreds. Advertising campaigns and a national sales force got the word out about the new-fangled confection of fluffy nougat, caramel and chocolate. The success of the Minnesota-born Milky Way would lead to other long-lasting hits such as Snickers, Three Musketeers and MM's, making the Mars family billionaires in the process. Today Mars is the fourth-largest private company in the YOU.S. with annual revenue of more than 45 billion, according to Forbes. We hold Milky Way in high esteem, said Anton Vincent, CEO of Mars Wrigley North America. The people that preceded me many years ago had an eye on the future and ensured that we had a place in people's lives. Who would-a thought it? The Milky Way went into full production in 1924. It is a nougat bar, which made him very different from the competition, layered with caramel then enrobed in chocolate, Borghesani said. That mechanical enrobing was key to the Milky Way's success -- it coated the sides of the bar evenly and advanced the industry beyond time-consuming hand-dipped chocolates. Similarly, it was a technological breakthrough that gave Milton Hershey the ability to scale his dreams into the first national chocolate empire decades earlier. Hershey would become a key chocolate supplier for Mars before the companies became bitter rivals, in part due to the success of the Milky Way and the threat it posed to Hershey bars. Mars dispatched sales teams to cities around the country -- a 1925 Minneapolis Journal ad sought detail men to sell Milky Ways. Lima will be campaigned this week by a crew of eight young men advertising the famous Milky Way candy bar, the News and Times-Democrat of Lima, Ohio, reported in 1925. By the end of the decade, sales had grown to 26 million -- almost half a billion in today's dollars -- and the dark chocolate and vanilla nougat bar that would become Milky Way Midnight was seeing early success. Having outgrown the Minneapolis warehouse, Mars Inc. built a factory in Chicago and moved its headquarters there in 1929. The company, now based in Virginia, announced just last year it would be closing that Chicago plant. 'I had an empire in my mind' Frank and Forrest Mars had a rocky relationship, and Forrest's ambition far outshone his father's. My father says, 'We are making enough money.' ... I had empire in my mind, Forrest Mars said in a family archive videotape, according to Jol Glenn Brenner's 1998 book The Emperors of Chocolate, which recounted the stories of the private Mars and Hershey families in unprecedented detail. Frank Mars gave his son 50,000 and the foreign rights to Milky Way in 1932, Brenner reported. Forrest then moved to London and introduced the Mars Bar -- essentially the Milky Way under a different name -- which still sells well in Europe today. After introducing Snickers and Three Musketeers bars during the company's first few years in Chicago, Frank Mars died in Baltimore in 1934, where he had gone to seek treatment for an illness. Forrest Mars eventually returned to the YOU.S. and ran Mars for decades, introducing MM's in 1941 and growing the company through pet food brands like Pedigree and Iams. He died in 1999, at the age of 95. His heirs still own the company. Vincent attributes the Milky Way's success to a century of strong relationships with consumers. There is a universal truth around what chocolate is and how it fits into people's lives. It is broadly appealing, Vincent said. Frank was a natural advertiser, and we have kept that tradition strong. ... I am responsible for the next 100 years. As Halloween approaches and candy bags fill with century-old brands, the cycle of nostalgia will continue. Consumers try it and like it and pass it down generation to generation, company historian Borghesani said.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Biden will visit Tel Aviv before going to Jordan where he will meet with King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The White House said Biden will reiterate that the militant group Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination, and discuss the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza. '(The) president will hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimizes civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas,' YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken also said his talks with Netanyahu yielded a possible breakthrough in getting humanitarian assistance to besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returns to Amman, Jordan, early October 17, 2023, after over seven hours of negotiations that went overnight with officials including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Today, and at our request, the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza - and them alone -- including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way, Blinken said in a brief statement to reporters. He said it is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible, but expressed concern that Hamas militants may try to seize supplies or prevent their distribution. Grave humanitarian crisis Palestinians in Gaza have been without electricity and under a complete Israeli siege with no food, fuel or water allowed into the Hamas-controlled territory since October 9. Israel says it imposed the blockade in response to the deadly terrorist attack Hamas launched on Israeli towns on October 7, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis. Nearly 200 others were taken hostage by the terror group. Israel has amassed 300,000 troops on Gaza's border, poised for a likely ground invasion, as it vows to wipe out Hamas. Israeli forces have been hitting Gaza with airstrikes since the Hamas attack, killing more than 2,800 people and wounding at least another 10,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have heeded Israel's orders to evacuate northern Gaza for the southern half of the Strip ahead of the expected offensive. There continues to be no water for the vast majority of the population in Gaza, said Juliette Touma, spokesperson for the YOU.N. agency that assists Palestinians, UNRWA. We are talking about 2 million people in the Gaza Strip who do not have water, and water is running out, and water is life, and life is running out of Gaza, Touma said. UNRWA said Monday that there are not enough body bags for the dead in Gaza. Embed share Israeli volunteers look for civilians, including babies and the elderly, taken hostage by Hamas Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Touma said an estimated 1 million Palestinians have fled toward the south and nearly 400,000 of them are sheltering mostly in UNRWA schools. One group is being housed in an UNRWA warehouse, which Touma said is not equipped to be a shelter. UNRWA has deployed an advance team to Egypt to prepare for the possible opening of a humanitarian corridor to bring aid supplies into Gaza. The United Nations said humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths will head to Egypt on Tuesday for several days. He also plans to visit Israel. At the United Nations, the Security Council voted late Monday on a Russian-drafted resolution seeking a humanitarian cease-fire and the release of all Israeli and foreign hostages. The measure, which Russia did not negotiate with council members, failed to receive the necessary support. Only five of the 15 council members supported the measure, four voted against it and six abstained. The United States was among those who did not support it. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said civilians should not have to suffer for Hamas' atrocities, but said the proposed text failed to condemn the terror group. By failing to condemn Hamas, Russia is giving cover to a terrorist group that brutalizes innocent civilians, she said. It is outrageous, it is hypocritical, and it is indefensible.

Speaking to the Israeli Knesset Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah, 'Do not test us in the north. Do not make the mistake of the past. Today, the price you will pay will be far heavier,' he said, referring to Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. The United Nations has a peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon that monitors the border with Israel. It said Monday that its headquarters in the Lebanese town of Naqoura was hit, but no one was injured. A spokesperson said the YOU.N. is investigating to see who fired at the facility.

While a threatened Israeli ground invasion has not yet begun, not even a temporary ceasefire appears to be anywhere on the horizon. A UN Security Council resolution drafted by Russia calling for an immediate ceasefire the and release of captives held in Gaza was voted down on Monday. A vote on a draft resolution from Brazil that, unlike the Russian text, specifically condemns Hamas, has been delayed until late Tuesday. In the meantime, Gaza's morgues and hospitals continue to overflow with casualties. The Gaza health ministry recorded 108 Palestinian fatalities over the past 24 hours as of 6pm local time on Monday, bringing the death toll in the territory since 7 October to 2,778 people. More than 1,000 of those killed were children, accounting for more than a third of the fatalities. Forty-seven Palestinian families have been killed and wiped from the civil registry, according to the health ministry. Hundreds of people are missing and believed to be trapped under the rubble, according to the UN. Mohammad Abu Rukbah, a field researcher for the children's rights group in Gaza, said that the psychological repercussions of Israel's war will be catastrophic. Witnessing the deaths of other children compounds their distress, leaving indelible scars on their mental well-being, Defense for Children International-Palestine added. Entire families are being wiped out in the blink of an eye, shattering the very foundations of these households. Children have been left orphaned and will now grapple not only with the pain of the current situation in their city but also with the daunting challenge of navigating life without the foundational support of their families. Hospitals are about to run out of fuel to power generators, endangering the lives of thousands of patients, according to the UN. Meanwhile, there is an imminent risk of death or infectious disease outbreak with the collapse of virtually all water and sanitation services in Gaza. As many as one million people - around half the population of Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas on the planet - are internally displaced, with many people moving from northern Gaza to the south after Israel ordered its evacuation ahead of a threatened ground invasion. More than 50 Palestinians, including 16 children, have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Monday that at least 15 journalists were among the more than 4,000 dead on both sides since the war began on 7 October. The press freedom watchdog said that freelance journalist Salam Mema is among the 11 Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza during that period. Her body was recovered from the rubble three days after her home was hit in an Israeli airstrike in Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza on 10 October. Mema held the position of head of the Women Journalists Committee at the Palestinian Media Assembly, an organization committed to advancing media work for Palestinian journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists said. The New York-based group said that three Israeli journalists were killed on 7 October: Shai Regev, an editor for Maariv; Ayelet Arnin, a news editor with Israel's public broadcaster; and Yaniv Zohar, a photojournalist for Israel Hayom, who was killed along with his wife and two daughters. Issam Abdallah, a videographer for Reuters, was killed when Israeli shelling targeted a group of journalists marked as press near the Lebanese border on 13 October. Israel says that 1,300 people were killed in the 7 October surprise attack led by the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. However, evidence is emerging that a significant number died not at the hands of Palestinians, but from Israeli police and military fire. Israel says that 199 people were captured and taken into Gaza on 7 October, though Hamas officials gave higher figures on Monday. Israel says that it is holding the bodies of 1,500 Palestinian fighters killed during the 7 October attack. An unknown number of those who Israel claims were militants may have actually been unarmed civilians from Gaza. Israel said on Monday that military forensic teams examining the bodies of people killed in the 7 October attack found multiple signs of torture, rape and other atrocities. Israeli military officers repeated thus far unsubstantiated claims that children were beheaded. In its report on the new claims on Monday, Reuters said the military personnel overseeing the identification process did not present any forensic evidence in the form of pictures or medical records. While serious abuses surely did occur during the 7 October attack, sensational claims made by the Israeli military on Monday may be another attempt to justify atrocity crimes in Gaza. Shawan Jabarin, the director of the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, called for an international independent investigation on Monday. Speaking from Ramallah, Jabarin condemned the EU and US for facilitating Israel's aggression on the civilian population in Gaza, which he said reached the threshold for the crime of genocide. Jabarin urged third states to pressure Israel to allow the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry to enter and investigate all crimes committed regardless of the perpetrators. Israel continued to target residential buildings in its nonstop bombardment of Gaza between late Sunday and Monday. The UN said that 10 Palestinians were killed in a strike targeting a residential building in Jabaliya; at least 11 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed in the Musabah area of Rafah in Gaza's south; and 11 Palestinians were killed when a charity organization's building was hit in Rafah. On Monday morning, 22 Palestinians were killed when Israel targeted a residential building in Khan Younis. The UN said that several attacks occurred in close proximity to a hospital and main roads, creating significant access challenges. Palestinians are meanwhile rationing whatever food, water and cooking gas they still have. He warned of additional casualties if hospitals, which are being powered by emergency generators, run out of fuel. Meanwhile, 2,500 people were sheltering at al-Shifa hospital, the largest health facility in Gaza. This is an urgent appeal. Please, if you are a human ... please stop this. Save Gaza, please support Gaza. On Monday, UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, denied reports that one of its Gaza warehouses had been looted. Israeli media reported that UNRWA had tweeted that fuel and medical equipment had been removed by the Gaza health ministry without authorization before deleting the tweets. In an urgent clarification, UNRWA said that the images circulating on social media showed a routine transfer of medical supplies to its health partners. Meanwhile, footage showed an UNRWA warehouse that was said to have been hit in an Israeli strike overnight Sunday: Water cannot be pumped and distributed without electricity and damage to water infrastructure from Israeli bombardment will make it difficult to access water even if the electricity and fuel is restored, Gisha said. The group noted that the last of Gaza's water desalination facilities shut down yesterday for lack of electricity. Israeli warplanes bombed Rafah crossing along the Egypt-Gaza boundary for the fourth time while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was meeting with Israel's emergency cabinet in Tel Aviv on Monday. On Sunday, Blinken said that an agreement had been reached to open Rafah crossing on Monday morning to let foreign passport-holders out of Gaza and let desperately needed humanitarian aid into the territory. The Egyptian group Sinai for Human Rights said on Monday that Israel targeted the barriers on the Egyptian side. Those barriers were put there by Egypt last week to prevent a feared mass exodus of Palestinians from Gaza to the Sinai. Giora Eiland, a reservist major general, stated that creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the goal. Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist, he added. Israel announced on Monday that residents of 28 settlements in close proximity to the border with Lebanon would be evacuated. Cross-border fire between the Israeli military and Hizballah in Lebanon have raised fears of a regional escalation. Some two dozen communities in the south of Israel near the Gaza boundary have already been evacuated, including the city of Sderot. A large proportion of Ashkelon's residents have also reportedly left, the UN said. Meanwhile, the Biden administration in Washington was deploying more offensive forces into the Middle East, to back Israel and attempt to deter Iran and Hizballah from opening a second front on Israel's north, the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz reported on Monday. CNN meanwhile reported that the US was sending 2,000 Marines and sailors to join the warships it has already sent to the eastern Mediterranean. The Biden administration has put on a big show of seemingly unconditional solidarity for Israel and has demonized Palestinians and parroted Israeli propaganda to manufacture consent for the genocidal campaign underway in Gaza. Gallant said that this will be a long war; the price will be high. But we are going to win for Israel and the Jewish people, and for the values that both countries believe in. US President Joe Biden is traveling to Israel to make a display of support on Wednesday. But behind the scenes, US officials are reportedly pressing Israel to determine an endgame. The Biden administration is surely aware that the situation could rapidly escalate and embroil the United States in a broader regional war that will cost more American lives, as Sam Heller and Thanassis Cambanis state in an analysis for The Century Foundation. Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said on Monday that more than 200 people captured in the 7 October attack are being held in Gaza. He said that Hamas was holding 200 of the captives and that as many as 50 additional captives were being held by other factions. Islamic Jihad has previously said that it is holding 30 captives. He said that the captives were being treated humanely and that they eat what we eat, and they drink what we drink. Israeli airstrikes had killed 22 captives, Abu Obeida said, most recently a 26-year-old artist from Tel Aviv. He said that foreign nationals being held captive in Gaza are our guests and that they would be protected and released when circumstances allow. But the Qassam spokesperson said that foreign nationals who had joined the Israeli army to fight against the Palestinian people would be treated like Israeli soldiers regardless of any other nationality they hold. The Qassam Brigades also released its first video of one of the captives. The video shows a woman who identifies herself as Maya Sham and who says in Hebrew that she was captured in the Sderot area. The video shows Sham being treated for an injury to her hand. They have been taking care of me, providing medication, she says and asks please get me out of here as quickly as possible. Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas' diaspora office, said in a lengthy interview with AlAraby TV on Monday that the captives include high-ranking officers from the Israeli military's Gaza Division. He said that the resistance has enough captives to free all 6,000 Palestinians being held in Israeli jails and prisons. Both Meshaal and Abu Obeida reaffirmed that Palestinians in Gaza would not be uprooted. The Qassam spokesperson said that a threatened ground invasion does not intimidate us and would provide the resistance with an opportunity to punish the enemy for its crimes. Meshaal said that an expulsion of Palestinians to Egypt was not only contrary to the interests of that country, but also to Jordan, implying that an ethnic cleansing of the West Bank would come next. Meshaal indicated that resistance was now the only path to liberation since all attempts at a peace process have failed for decades. He expressed confidence that Israel's vows to destroy Hamas would fail, asserting that it had tried numerous times to destroy the resistance and had emerged defeated. Underlining that Hamas did not stand alone, he said that Hizballah thankfully took steps since the current confrontation began, but said that the battle requires more. That may soon come, as Iran's foreign minister said on Monday that preventive action by the resistance axis may happen in a matter of hours. Echoing the UN secretary-general, the world body's humanitarian aid chief Martin Griffiths called on Monday for the immediate release of Israelis and foreign nationals being held in Gaza. The International Committee of the Red Cross told Israeli media that it was speaking directly with senior Hamas officials to demand access to Israeli hostages, The Times of Israel reported. Israeli media, citing foreign diplomatic sources, reported on Monday that talks have been underway to secure the release of some of the captive. The Israeli military says that 199 civilians and soldiers captured on 7 October are being held in Gaza. The Israeli government has prioritized exacting revenge in Gaza and reestablishing deterrence over the release of the captives, saying that negotiations would take place only after the war. Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to have crashed a meeting between the prime minister and families whose relatives are being held in Gaza. Netanyahu has come under fierce criticism in Israel for not taking responsibility for the government's failure to prevent the 7 October attack. He did not meet with the families of captives held in Gaza for more than a week. Representatives of five families were present at the meeting that was coordinated with the prime minister's office at short notice. According to Israeli media, members of a family unknown to the organization representing the families of captives and missing persons joined the meeting. One of the members of the family unknown to the organization that coordinated the meeting said that he loves his daughter as much as the others love their family members. But at the end we have to look at the people of Israel and the future of our existence here - suggesting that he would rather that Israel pound Gaza than negotiate the release of the captives. An Israeli journalist whose family members were being held in Gaza accused Netanyahu of deliberately drawing divisions between the families of captives. Netanyahu's office denied planting people in the meeting. Meanwhile, parents of Israelis being held in Gaza who are camped outside of the Israeli defense ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, demanding that Netanyahu prioritize their release, are being attacked and threatened by Israelis who want to see the continued annihilation of Gaza. The father of a captive was even told I hope your daughter dies by an apparently right-wing activist, according to Israeli media reports.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Earlier, a video allegedly showing explosions in Berdiansk appeared in local mass media. City residents said they witnessed how ammunition detonated in the area of the local airfield. Major-in-exile of the occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, also announced the news and released a video. While we were sleeping, the Armed Forces eliminated Russian troops at the Berdiansk airfield, Fedorov said. Residents of the city spent half the night listening to the wonderful 'tracks' of the impacts and detonation of ammunition. Later, the Ukrainian army's General Staff reported that the strikes destroyed two Russian helicopters, an ammunition warehouse, and an artillery system. What we know about situation in occupied Luhansk and Berdiansk The southern city of Berdiansk, Zaporizhzhia region, has been under Russian occupation since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. Now, explosions are being heard more and more often in Berdiansk, mainly near the local airfield. After the start of the full-scale war, the Russian occupiers used it to deploy their units and base helicopters. In mid-August, occupied Berdiansk was rocked by an explosion near the port. In late June, a series of explosions happened in the city, with more than ten strikes on the Russian troops and equipment. Recently, there have also been more and more explosions in Luhansk, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. In late September, the impact destroyed the Russian ammunition warehouse at the Yunist radio equipment and radio electronics factory. In mid-June, sounds similar to explosions were heard in the occupied Yuvileine, Luhansk region. Then, the Ukrainian armed forces released a video of the damage to the Russian missile arsenal in the Luhansk region. Luhansk hosts a large number of Russian occupiers. According to Ukraine's General Staff, the Russians are turning hospitals in the city into hospitals for wounded soldiers. As Rubryka reported, Russia has concentrated more than 420,000 of its troops in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories, including Crimea.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

CBS News reported that the Colorado State Patrol said the driver was a 60-year-old man from California. According to the Associated Press, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said it has yet to be determined if there were any other vehicles involved in the accident. Per CNN, no train personnel were injured from the derailment and resulting bridge collapse. Related: 'Wonderful' 12-Year-Old Boy and His Grandfather Die After Head-On Crash with Semi-Truck On Sunday, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg shared on X that he was in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and debriefed by the Federal Railroad  Federal Highway administrations on the accident. He noted that the United States Department of Transportation's staff are en route. Buttigieg wrote in a separate post: State  local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected. As of Monday afternoon, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) said the nine-mile road traveling northbound on Interstate 25 where the accident occurred is closed and will be an extended closure. Related: Family Escapes After Car Crashes Into Home, Causing Fire That Destroyed 1M Baseball Collection Per AP News, Perez said it will remain unclear when the section of the highway will be open until investigators examine the scene. BNSF Railway, the Forth Worth-based operator of the coal train, said its staff is helping to clean up the wreckage, according to CNN. CBS News reported that heavy construction equipment was brought in to help with the effort. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) wrote in a post on X on Sunday that it is investigating the accident. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby told AP News that the bridge most likely did not collapse because it was not strong enough. Instead, Quimby said part of the train probably crashed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that hold it up to be displaced and thus the structure to give way. However, Quimbly also noted that investigators will examine if foul play was involved.

The Denver-based BNSF owns and operated the train. The driver was in a truck that was crushed when 30 cars of a 124-car coal train derailed late Sunday afternoon, taking down part of a bridge over Interstate 25. It is likely to take days to reopen the highway, which remained closed Monday night. The incident left rail cars on the highway as well as tons of coal. RELATED: It could be days before Interstate 25 reopens after deadly Colorado train derailment, Polis says That many rail cars and coal all over the road it is a pretty big deal, said the Colorado Department of Transportation's Amber Shipley. National Transportation Safety Board investigators were on site Monday to attempt to establish what went wrong. Early indications appear to indicate the train derailed before the bridge came down. The bridge over the highway is 65 years old. BNSF released a scant statement on the crash, including noting that no crew members were hurt and that the because is under investigation. It is a tragedy, said Nick Hinrichsen, a state senator in Pueblo County, whose district includes the area of the derailment. Regardless of what specifically happened here there is a trend nationwide of increasing derailments and increasing severity. The state of Colorado has been looking at creating additional regulations to enhance safety on its rail lines. At least a dozen states around the country have initiated efforts to tighten regulations after Congress, amid pressure against changes by railroads, has declined to pass any changes, which have been advocated by the Federal Railroad Administration after a major derailment in February of this year in East Palestine, Ohio. That derailment containing hazardous chemicals was allowed to burn for days, bringing anger from local residents over what some viewed as lax regulation. Among the states to create regulatory change is Kansas, which now requires two operators on trains. Train derailments have become somewhat more frequent and there is been somewhat of an increase in the severity of the accidents when they do derail, said Hinrichsen. The Colorado Senate's Transportation Legislative Review Committee has voted to approve legislation for the upcoming legislative session that will include several safety requirements in Colorado. Those include limits on train length to 8,500 feet. Hirichsen notes some now exceed 2 miles in length. The legislation under consideration would also include the requirement of bearing heat sensors that could indicate a problem. The data, says Hinrichsen, would go not only to command centers possibly hundreds of thousands of miles away, but to the train's engineers. Colorado would also look at limiting the amount of time trains could be parked at highway crossings. Emergency vehicles have had to go around some trains parked for extended periods. Among additional concerns for Colorado lawmakers is the potential of the Uinta Basin Railway Project which is proposed to connect oil drilling sites in Utah with rail networks that would allow the shipment of crude oil through track along the Colorado River. That project has been put on hold by a federal judge after the idea was approved by the federal Surface Transportation Board. That is going to be a significant amount of hazardous materials, said Hinrichsen. The safety statistics are blinking red, he said. So it is important that we get this right now. because the potential for health impacts, for ecological impacts for community-wide damage, is a lot more significant.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

This is significant not only because it would make the NNPC Ltd the first state-owned national company to sign onto the global initiative, it is committing to sustainable, socially responsible business practices, something the national oil company is not always reputed for. It could also signal, that the corporation, long accused of being opaque may now be ready to turn the corner. Launched in 2000, The United Nations Global Compact is a non-binding United Nations pact to get businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies and to report on their implementation. Under the Global Compact, companies are brought together with UN agencies, labour groups and civil society. Its founding principles are Human Rights -Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour: Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

Nwokolo - Executive Director, UN Global Compact Nigeria Environment: Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti-Corruption: Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Through these principles, it seeks to catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It seeks commitments to specific sustainability and social responsibility goals from CEOs and highest-level executives, and in turn, offers training, peer networks and a functional framework for responsibility. Why it matters In her remarks shortly after signing on behalf of the UN Global Compact, Naomi Nwokolo, the Executive Director, UN Global Compact Network Nigeria, described NNPC Ltd.'s move to become a participant of the UN Global Compact as a pivotal step in fostering a culture of ethical business conduct, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. This strategic alliance provides NNPC Ltd. with an invaluable platform to showcase best practices, engage in collective sustainability initiatives, and contribute substantially to the attainment of the 2030 Agenda. The event will catalyse the adoption of best practices throughout the Nigerian energy sector, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and environmental stewardship.

Nigeria is one of the largest producers of crude oil in Africa, a transition from an energy system driven by fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy will have a far-reaching impact on the economy. In the interim, the disposition of the current president and in fact, his policies have been geared towards more drilling, this could conflict with the stated goals of shift towards cleaner energy. By joining the pact, the NNPC Ltd is pledging an unwavering commitment. This momentous development holds profound significance, signifying a substantial leap towards the promotion of sustainable development and ethical business practices within Nigeria's oil and gas sector, the UN Global Compact said in its release. The quiet part about this pact is that companies also committed themselves to ethical business practices. For a company like the NNPC Ltd which has often been abused by successive governments to serve as a patronage system for politicians or other interests, it calls for better business practices. In the very least, the corporation will actively collaborate with a global community of more than 15,000 like-minded enterprises and over 4,000 non-business entities to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within Nigeria. In 2022, the corporation imported petrol with high sulphur content and there are legitimate concerns that its refineries are not being retooled to produce cleaner fuels. It would do more than issue a terse press statement denying unethical practices but must transparently give an account of its operations. We are confident that NNPC Limited's participation will catalyse the adoption of best-in-class practices throughout the Nigerian energy sector, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and environmental stewardship... Read also: Ki-moon appoints Bola Adesola to UN Global Compact board To foster this culture of transparency and accountability, NNPC Ltd. like its peers signed on to the pact is under obligation to publish its audited financial statements as well as begin publishing its operations and financial reports which gives a window to its activities. This also requires that the organisation provide lawmakers on oversight function, with clear and unambiguous answers to questions about its operations. It further requires that it must let the sun into contracts with other operators and agreements including crude swaps, deals such as crude for collateral and proper responses to the audit queries from the Accountant General's office. Kyari said that as a dynamic global energy company with businesses and operations spanning the entire energy value chain, NNPC Ltd.'s participation in the UN Global Compact serves as a testament to Nigeria's commitment to working with global partners to achieve a just Energy Transition. It is the company's actions in the days ahead that will determine its true commitment.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The main north-south highway in Colorado remained closed Monday morning and the Colorado Department of Transportation said it expected an extended closure. The truck driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident along Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. (Colorado Highway Patrol via AP) DENVER -- A truck driver was killed when a train derailed near Pueblo, Colorado, and caused a railroad bridge to collapse onto a major highway -- crushing the semitruck, spilling coal and mangled rail cars across the roadway and shutting down traffic indefinitely, authorities said Monday. The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. The partially collapsed bridge could be seen Monday afternoon with the semitruck caught beneath it in the northbound right lane. Derailed train cars were piled up on the bridge and along the tracks to the northeast and large amounts of coal covered a portion of the highway. A nine-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge partially collapsed when the train hauling 124 cars of coal derailed at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday just as the semitrailer truck passed beneath it, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Thirty cars derailed, the agency said. Investigators from the NTSB arrived Monday at the site, just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. They will determine the because after looking at the adequacy of prior track inspections, the condition and maintenance history of the bridge and any issues with the train or rail cars, the agency said in a statement. A preliminary report will be released in 30 days. It was not immediately known whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. It could take as long as 48 hours to clear the coal and other debris and make the highway passable, Gov. Jared Polis said. That work will not begin until federal investigators give the state clearance to proceed, Polis said. He added that Colorado had been waiting months to receive federal money already dedicated for safety and rail projects. Those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, the Democratic governor said in a statement. I am saddened that a life was lost in this train derailment and send my condolences to his family and loved ones. The bridge was built in 1958, Colorado Transportation Department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said the most likely scenario was that the derailed cars slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that support it to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which were ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain the ones that they own. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem. At least 111 railroad accidents have been caused by bridge failures or bridge misalignments since 1976, according to an Associated Press review of federal accident records. That is just over two accidents annually on average. Combined, those derailments caused about 40 million in damages, the records show. That figure does not include the June derailment. Only one of the accidents involved a fatality, when one person was killed and dozens of people injured after an Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in 1997 while crossing a bridge damaged by runoff from heavy rain. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said a few hours before Biden was set to take off that the trip would be rescheduled.

Nicole Fahey is pictured getting a Covid booster shot in Los Angeles on November 3, 2021. Gary Coronado  Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file As the winter respiratory illness season fast approaches, this is the first year that four vaccines are being recommended during pregnancy. Yet, there are already signs that fewer pregnant women are getting vaccinated -- putting themselves and their newborns at increased risk of severe illness or death. We are meeting more resistance than I ever remember, said Dr. Neil Silverman, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UCLA Health. We did not get this kind of pushback on this scale before the pandemic. Now all vaccines are lumped together as 'bad,' he said. In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended for the first time that pregnant people get the RSV vaccine to protect against an infection that is usually mild in healthy adults but can be dangerous for children younger than 5. The new guidance means pregnant women will be encouraged to get four vaccines to protect against the flu, Covid and pertussis (also called whooping cough), as well as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. However, a recent CDC report found growing doubts about vaccination during pregnancy. Among almost 2,000 women who were pregnant during the height of last year's cold and flu season or when the survey was conducted in March and April, almost a quarter said they were very hesitant about getting a flu shot. That is a significant increase over the 17.2 who said they had the same level of reservations during the 2021-2022 respiratory illness season. That reluctance has translated to fewer pregnant women protected against influenza and other illnesses. Even prior to the pandemic, it was a struggle to get pregnant women vaccinated, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, vice president for medical affairs at the University of Iowa Health Care, as well as a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Since then, skepticism about vaccines has ballooned and spread to common flu shots that have been given to millions of pregnant women over several decades without any evidence of problematic side effects. Last year, the CDC study found, 47.2 of expectant mothers got their flu shots, down from 57.5 who got their flu shots during the pre-Covid 2019-20 season. Just more than half, or 55.4, got their Tdap vaccines and only 27.3 of women got the Covid booster before or during pregnancy last season, when omicron infections were filling hospitals. The Tdap vaccine protects newborns against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis and has been recommended during pregnancy since 2011. Tdap is just barely recovering from pre-pandemic levels, Jamieson said. The number of women vaccinated for Covid is disappointing. According to Dr. Linda Eckert, an OB-GYN and global health and immunization expert at the University of Washington, there is a bias that some patients have, more than they used to, about how they feel about a vaccine. When Eckert recommends a vaccine to her pregnant patients, more now react with, I am not going to talk about it, she said. Pregnant women are primed to question everything they put in their body, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. That instinct is a good one. It is protective mothering, said Dr. Jodie Dionne, associate director of Global Health in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for Women's Reproductive Health. We actually want women to question what they are putting in their body. There are a lot of myths out there, what I would call blatant disinformation that is intended to be more politically charged, not based in science, said Dr. Melissa Simon, an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The only way doctors can address those concerns effectively, Dionne said, is to create an open atmosphere where they feel comfortable telling you what they are worried about. A key finding in the CDC report is that when obstetricians or providers talked to women about the need for vaccination, they were less hesitant. A lot more people are vaccine hesitant than anti-vaccine, Eckert said. Vaccine hesitant individuals tend to be curious. Doctors perfected their skills addressing patients' vaccine concerns when Covid shots became crucial, said Dr. Sarah Pachtman, a maternalfetal physician at Northwell Health's Katz Women's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York. We have had so much practice, she said, adding that she is encountered less vaccine hesitancy this year compared to before the pandemic. I noticed myself spending more time counseling patients, she said. That helps decrease their hesitancy. During pregnancy, the belly enlarges, pushing up against the diaphragm, decreasing lung capacity. That makes pregnant women -- especially those late in their pregnancies -- more vulnerable to breathing difficulties, Simon said. When an infection like RSV or Covid or influenza gets into that lung space, it is even harder for people who are pregnant to breathe, she said. Pregnant women are one of the most at-risk groups for flu complications. Covid can also be harmful during pregnancy, and can increase the risk of preterm births and other complications. The virus almost killed Haeli Graham of Swansboro, North Carolina, and caused her son to be born three months early. On July 4, 2021, Graham, then 27 years old and six months pregnant, went to the emergency room, gasping for air, she said. I could not breathe and I could not feel my baby moving anymore, she said. A Covid test came back positive. Within days, her lungs collapsed and she developed two pulmonary embolisms. She was intubated and put into a medically induced coma to give her lungs time to heal. Graham had no idea that doctors had to deliver her baby early until she woke up more than a month later. I was speechless, she said. It was just shocking that me -- a very healthy, active 27-year-old female -- could have died. Her son, Colton, was born at just 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Despite some delays, he is now a healthy 2 year old. Though Covid vaccines were available by summer 2021, Graham's doctor at the time advised her against getting the shot, citing a lack of evidence about their safety. It was a very scary time, Graham said. We had no idea what to do. It was not until August 2021, a month after she had been hospitalized with Covid, that the CDC said it had gathered enough evidence to recommend the shots for pregnant people. Now is the time for flu, as well as Covid shots -- just ahead of the typical winter respiratory virus season, experts say. Those shots can be given at any stage of pregnancy, according to the CDC. Timing for the two other recommended shots is more specific and should be given during the third trimester. The Tdap vaccine is given between the 27th and 36th weeks of gestation, ideally during the earlier part of that timeline. That timing helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth, the CDC says on its website. That is especially important when it comes to protecting against whooping cough. Babies are not eligible for the shots themselves until they are several months old. Babies who catch whooping cough, especially those younger than 3 months old, are most likely to have serious problems, have to be cared for in a hospital, and possibly even die, Tami Skoff, a CDC epidemiologist, wrote in an email. Vaccinating women during every pregnancy is critical for providing the best protection to the youngest of babies. A CDC study published in February found that the number of babies 2 months and younger who developed whooping cough was significantly lower after the vaccines were recommended. The vaccine is given during each subsequent pregnancy because those antibodies decrease in the mother's body over time. The single-dose RSV shot from Pfizer is recommended between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. It was found to lower the risk of severe RSV among infants by 91 within the first three months after birth, a time when babies are especially vulnerable. Last winter, a surge of RSV among young children overwhelmed hospitals. Doctors insist there is no danger in vaccinations during pregnancy. We have been vaccinating pregnant people for decades, Silverman said. While any vaccine for any person, pregnant or not, can have a rare side effect, those serious side effects are exceedingly low. And none of these vaccines have ever been shown to have any negative impact on the fetus or newborn. Vaccines are a very efficient way to protect mothers and to protect their babies in one fell swoop, he said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

In 2019, the DRC created Entreprise Gnrale du Cobalt (EGC), which holds a monopoly on the purchase and sale of artisanal cobalt, in order to improve the working conditions of artisanal miners, known as creuseurs. Since then, the state-owned company has remained largely inactive. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people are working in disastrous conditions in informal cobalt mines in the DRC, the world's largest producer of this mineral essential for the manufacture of electric batteries, against a backdrop of accusations of child labour and corruption. Speaking on the sidelines of a cobalt workshop in Kinshasa, EGC's managing director told AFP that the company was studying eight pilot sites from which it could soon start sourcing. These sites are located on concessions belonging to state-owned Congolese mining company Gcamines, in Lualaba and Haut-Katanga, two provinces in the south-east of the country. We are in the process of analysing the mineralisation to ensure that we can use them as pilot sites, explained Eric Kalala. Confirmation of the designation of these sites is expected within the next few weeks, he added, explaining that the EGC would then endeavour to control access to the mines, distribute protective equipment and launch an ore traceability programme. This is a first step, he said. According to EGC officials present at Thursday's meeting, the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and delays in setting up a market regulator have contributed to the difficulties in getting the company off the ground. Speaking before the meeting, mining activist Franck Fwamba accused politicians with interests in the informal cobalt mines. He also referred to the supposed hostility of the Minister of Mines, Antoinette N'Samba, towards EGC and its monopoly, which she considered illegal. When contacted for comment, the minister's office had not responded by the end of the day on Thursday.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Instead, they have evolved a repertoire of biological and behavioural techniques to resist undesirable advances, from expressing disinterest through body language to physically rejecting unwanted suitors. In some cases, however, they must get rather inventive. A new study, led by Carolin Dittrich and Mark-Oliver Rdel from the Museum fr Naturkunde in Berlin, delves into two such exceptional instances of creative rejection tactics exhibited by female common frogs. In the world of amphibians, particularly frogs and toads, romance is a high-stakes, high-speed affair. These creatures are known for their explosive breeding seasons, characterised by a brief and intense reproductive period that typically spans a few days to a few weeks. During this window, hundreds to thousands of frogs congregate at breeding sites. But here is the catch: female frogs often need to mature before they can reproduce, and they do not breed every year. As a result, males significantly outnumber females, leading to fierce competition among the males, who passionately latch onto anything that moves. Should a male mistakenly grab another male, a peculiar release call is used to signal the blunder to the fellow in error. It was previously thought that female frogs within these breeding aggregations were largely defenceless against male coercion. In the chaotic environment of amphibian amorousness, it is not unusual for numerous males to cling to a single female, forming a perilous mating ball that often results in the female's demise. Amidst this tumult, female frogs have developed peculiar behaviours as a means to escape the relentless pursuit of males. The most common tactic employed by these females is to rotate on their axis, effectively dodging the advances of eager suitors. But Dittrich and Rdel's research reveals that female frogs have more tricks up their proverbial sleeves to elude the tenacious males. In one of nature's more unconventional strategies, female frogs have been observed imitating the calls of males, producing a deeper, lower-frequency grunt that emulates the male's release call, effectively tricking their persistent paramours into releasing them. Elaborating on this behaviour, Dittrich said: Tonic immobility in the context of mating is exceptional and very rarely observed. I know of only a few studies that have found tonic immobility associated with mating, for example in spiders or dragonflies. It is generally assumed that this strategy is used as a last resort to avoid predation. Rdel adds: We, therefore, suspect that this defensive behaviour has evolved to protect the female from the formation of 'mating balls,' which can often lead to the death of the female. Calling allows females to show that they are not ready to mate, and if this is of no use, stressed females can fall into tonic immobility. The findings leave one pondering the intricate dance of nature, where even the most ordinary and well-studied species can spring forth surprises as captivating and imaginative as any tale of love in the human world. It is a testament to the art of survival, reminding us that in the animal kingdom, much like in our own, love often takes the most creative and unexpected forms.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Weather experts say it will bring a month's worth of rain in just 24 hours. The Met Office has issued warning for a huge stretch of the country from Cambridge in the southeast to East Renfrewshire, Scotland. The main focus of the warning is on counties Antrim and Down, where the heaviest rain is most likely over high ground, said the BBC. The naming of the storm Babet was named by the UK's Met Office, which said the severe weather will continue will Saturday. Babet is the second named storm of the season after Agnes in September, which brought 129 kmph winds in Wales. The name was coined by the Dutch weather service, after a woman who said she had been born during a storm. What is the severe weather forecast? The heavy rain will continue from Wednesday to Saturday and the accumulation is expected to be as much as 150-200mm, said the BBC. The Met Office has issued a yellow alert.

The Met Office's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain and gale-force winds that could bring widespread flooding and a 'danger to life'. Yellow weather warnings are in force from tomorrow morning until Saturday, but the alert is likely to be escalated and reach amber or even red in parts of Scotland. As the storm approaches tonight, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. Travel disruption is also expected across the UK - with National Rail already saying CrossCountry and Great Western Railway services between Exeter, Paignton and Plymouth are likely to be disrupted from 5.30pm today due to the severe weather. Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. The yellow warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. These alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days.

People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days. Parts of England can expect more than 100mm (4in) of rainfall during the week with some isolated areas facing up to 150mm (6in). Downpours may cause 'fast-flowing and deep floodwater' that could pose a 'danger to life' and the transport network could suffer major disruption. There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend.

The Met Office 's second named storm of the season will bring up to 200mm (8in) of rain and gale-force winds that could bring widespread flooding and a 'danger to life'. Yellow weather warnings are in force from tomorrow morning until Saturday, but the alert is likely to be escalated and reach amber or even red in parts of Scotland. As the storm approaches tonight, forecasters said gale-force gusts could occur along the coasts of Wales and South West England, as well as to the west of higher ground areas such as Dartmoor in southern Devon and Eryri in North West Wales. Travel disruption is also expected across the UK - with National Rail already saying CrossCountry and Great Western Railway services between Exeter, Paignton and Plymouth are likely to be disrupted from 5.30pm today due to the severe weather. Babet - which comes three weeks after 84mph Storm Agnes hit the UK - is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. The yellow warnings for rain and wind cover much of Scotland, eastern Northern Ireland, the North East of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia. These alerts - which also warn of power cuts and the possible collapse of buildings due to flooding - could be upgraded to amber or even red over the coming days. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in the UK, with only a handful of recent examples including in February 2022 for Storm Eunice, which was the most damaging storm to hit England and Wales since February 2014. Others were issued for Storm Arwen on north-eastern coasts in November 2021 and Storm Dennis in parts of South Wales in February 2020. During storm Babet, as much as 150mm (6in) to 200mm (8in) of rain is expected to fall on central and eastern areas of Scotland and there is a possibility of 70mph gale-force winds affecting northern parts of the UK, forecasters warned. Scotland typically receives 168mm (6.6in) of rainfall in October, but the country will receive more than this amount in the span of a few days. Parts of England can expect more than 100mm (4in) of rainfall during the week with some isolated areas facing up to 150mm (6in). Downpours may cause 'fast-flowing and deep floodwater' that could pose a 'danger to life' and the transport network could suffer major disruption. There is also a chance of essential services like gas, water and mobile phone signals being disrupted. The east coast of Scotland could also be battered by huge waves. The heaviest rain is expected in eastern areas of Scotland, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7 to 8 in Scotland, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. Communities in Aviemore, Highlands, Argyll and Bute, and Perthshire were badly impacted October, with weather so bad it was compared to the Beast from the East in 2018. Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83, and large parts of the Scottish rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required, and we continue to work with the Met Office to monitor the situation 247. Impacts from surface water and rivers are likely, and with catchments saturated from recent heavy rain and flooding, we are urging people to be prepared for potential flooding. There is also concern that surface water flooding may be exacerbated by debris blocking drainage, culverts, etc as a result of the high winds. If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel.' Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: 'A disruptive period of weather is on the way. There is some high totals (of rain) which have the potential to disrupt travel plans... possibility of power cuts as well as the obvious risk of flooding. As you look at Wednesday, the first pulse of rain is looking to particularly influence Northern Ireland, Wales and the southwest of England, and into Thursday. But it is as you move from Thursday and into the week that shift very much focuses more towards central and eastern Scotland, but also some central and eastern areas of England as well.' He added that further weather warnings are likely to be announced by the Met Office in the coming days. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers. Sam Hughes, the charity's water safety partner, said: 'The forecasted strong winds along with heavy rain are likely to cause dangerous conditions for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland. The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life. If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard if by the coast, or the fire service if inland. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Do not go in the water yourself - you may end up in difficulty too.' Met Office chief meteorologist Steven Keates said: 'Heavy and persistent rain will fall onto already saturated ground bringing a risk of flooding. 'It is important to stay up to date with warnings from your local flood warning agency as well as the local authorities. 'For Scotland, this rain will be fairly heavy and persistent through much of the second half of the week and into the early part of the weekend. 'As well as heavy rain, Storm Babet will bring some very strong winds and large waves near some eastern coasts too. 'Gusts in excess of 60mph are possible in eastern and northern Scotland from Thursday. It is likely Met Office warnings will be updated through the week.'Great Western Railway It comes after southern England experienced its first autumn frost of the year yesterday as temperatures plummeted below zero. Charlwood in Surrey was the chilliest place in England with -1.4C (29F), while the cold snap was also felt in Benson in Oxfordshire, Farnborough in Hampshire and Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the mercury fell to -1C (30F). Gatwick and Stansted airports reported readings of 0C (32F), while the Scottish Highlands was hit by temperatures of -2.2C (28F). As many as 35 weather stations reported temperatures below freezing last night, the Met Office said. The last such widespread frost was 172 days ago on April 27. The RAC was fearing an estimated 20 per cent spike in callouts yesterday on what it dubbed 'Flat Battery Monday' as car motors were more likely to fail due to the freezing night. In the Republic of Ireland, Met ireann has issued orange weather warnings for Cork and Waterford as spells of heavy rain and blustery winds are expected to arrive this morning. The Met ireann warning will be in effect from 6am today until 6am tomorrow. The forecaster told residents to expect considerable rainfall combined with 'blustery east to southeast winds at times'. Storm Babet could cause poor visibility, localised flooding, difficult driving conditions and possible wave overtopping at high tide, the forecaster said. Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kilkenny and Wexford were given a yellow rain warning that comes into effect at 6am today. A yellow rain warning for Connacht will be in place from noon today until noon tomorrow, while one for Antrim, Armagh and Down will begin at 6am tomorrow and run until noon on Thursday.

As representatives of 130 countries gather for a summit in Beijing to mark a decade of the project, AFP looks at some of the key issues surrounding the massive infrastructure project: - Debt, opaque costs - The Belt and Road is a landmark project in President Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas, with Beijing saying it has now inked over two trillion dollars in contracts around the world. Its most high-profile projects have laid down high-speed rail tracks crisscrossing South East Asia and massive transport, energy and infrastructure works through Central Asia. But the flip side of the massive infrastructure spending is the huge debts incurred by participating countries. China said this month that BRI participants owe more than 300 billion to the Export-Import Bank of China. And BRI nations were hit especially hard during the Covid-19 pandemic as soaring inflation and interest rates hurt their ability to repay debts. Critics have also pointed to opaque pricing for the projects built by Chinese companies, with countries including Malaysia and Myanmar renegotiating BRI deals to bring down costs. Residents of BRI nations have also complained that the majority of jobs at infrastructure projects are being done by Chinese workers who send their wages home rather than spend them in local businesses. China has been forced to hand out billions of dollars in bailout loans to BRI countries in recent years to allow the countries to extend their loans and remain solvent, according to a joint report this year by the World Bank and other institutions. - Chinese influence - The BRI has functioned as a diplomatic vehicle burnishing China's image as leader of the global South, while giving Chinese infrastructure firms a foothold in many emerging economies. That has fueled concerns, especially among Western nations, that China is seeking to rebuild the global world order to its advantage, while opposition voices in BRI countries have also decried what they see as increasing Chinese influence in local politics. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that China could use the initiative as a pretext to build up military bases around the world in the name of protecting BRI investments. - Environmental concerns - The initiative has also drawn scrutiny for its massive carbon footprint and the environmental degradation caused by massive infrastructure projects. The development of megaports, pipelines, railways and highways could render the Paris climate goals unreachable, researchers from China, the United States and the United Kingdom warned in 2019. Meanwhile, a report by experts at Boston University's Global Development Policy warned that Chinese-led hard infrastructure projects carry higher risks to indigenous lands and ecosystems due to the country's relative newcomer status in global development finance and its early stages of developing environmental and social risk management due diligence policies and procedures. China has sought to allay environmental fears, promising in 2021 not to build new coal power plants abroad, though many previously agreed projects are still in progress. - Economic benefits - China argues that the BRI brings high-quality development to partner countries -- insisting that while Western projects offer only short-term aid to the Global South, Beijing provides for long-term opportunities with lasting impact. The Boston University researchers noted the BRI's role in providing additional resources for the Global South and fostering significant economic growth. Chinese overseas development finance has been much more focused on industrial and infrastructure lending, they said. Chinese finance is thus more associated with economic growth, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and increased energy access. The World Bank has also said that BRI transport projects -- including railway lines and highways -- substantially improve trade, foreign investment, and living conditions for citizens in participating countries. BRI transport projects, if fully implemented, could raise global income by 0.7 to 2.9 percent, the World Bank estimates.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

A manhunt was launched after two Swedish men were killed Monday night in the city. The perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died, said Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden on Tuesday morning. We would like to thank the intelligence and security services, as well as the public prosecutor's office, for their swift and decisive action last night and this morning, she said on the social platform X. Verlinden told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the suspected murder weapon had been found. Police said Monday night that the person responsible for the attack had said on social media that he was inspired by Islamic State ideology. Alexander De Croo, the Belgian prime minister, said Tuesday morning that he had offered his condolences to the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson. As close partners the fight against terrorism is a joint one, De Croo wrote on X. Brussels was hosting an international soccer match on Monday night between the men's national teams of Belgium and Sweden, which was abandoned at half time after news of the shootings emerged.

The BRF will be held from October 17 to 18 in Beijing. (XinhuaJu Huanzong) Since its debut, the BRI has been conceptualized as the Green Belt and Road as China is committed to sustainability, environmental protection, and international environmental standards. BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Over the last decade, large infrastructure projects across the land, water, and even deserts of the globe have been erected under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), remarkably facilitating transportation and economic development. Amid appreciation and applause from the host countries, there are some discordant voices in the West alleging that those projects have posed negative impacts on the environment. No doubt, such opinions were misguided and need to be critically examined. PRESERVING BIO-DIVERSITY RATHER THAN DESTROYING Before 2022, travelers from northern Croatia had to pass through a 9-km stretch of Bosnia and Herzegovina's coast to reach Ston, a small town located at Peljesac, a sun-drenched peninsula in southern Croatia. The construction of the Peljesac bridge, a BRI project, shortened the distance, but also made local oyster farmers worry that it would affect the production of shellfish, which has been inscribed into the European Union (EU) Geographical Indications Register. However, the Chinese companies that built the bridge have always adhered to the highest environmental standards, and the local farmers told me that the production and quality of oysters have not been affected at all, and the bridge has actually boosted their sales, said Qi Qianjin, Chinese ambassador to Croatia. A zebra is seen next to a fence as a freight train runs on the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway track in Kenya, on July 28, 2022. (XinhuaDong Jianghui) Actually, environmental conservation measures, such as water protection and management, noise control, and the construction of bridges to ensure the safe passage of wildlife, have been widely employed in BRI projects. In Kenya, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) runs through some sensitive ecosystems such as national parks. The project has designed several wildlife corridors, including seven bridges, several culverts, and embankments to funnel wildlife to the underpasses to reduce the risk of train-wildlife collision. Noise absorbers are also installed along the wildlife corridors to reduce possible disturbance of the animals. It is one of the most important projects where BRI has made substantial efforts to lower impacts on ecologically vulnerable areas, said Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan international relations scholar. In many BRI host countries, traditional dependence on fossil fuels caused air pollution, harmed people's health, and created a dilemma between reducing carbon emissions and economic development. Committed to open, green and clean cooperation towards inclusive and sustainable development, the BRI incorporates many projects designated to promote clean and renewable energy, such as wind farms, solar power plants, and eco-friendly transportation systems. Through BRI projects our government has taken different projects for the reduction of carbon emission and transition to green energy sources in our country, said Dilip Barua, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist). The former Bangladeshi industries minister said China had assisted his country in constructing several solar power plants, such as the Cox's Bazar wind power project, being environmentally friendly energy sources. The recently inaugurated Cox's Bazar wind power project, a flagship initiative invested by Wuling Power Corp. and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp., marked a major milestone in Bangladesh's quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy. The wind power project is located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from the capital Dhaka. Upon operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 metric tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 metric tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households. It is a major watershed in our nation's journey towards cleaner and more sustainable energy, said Md. Habibur Rahman, senior secretary of Power Division under Bangladesh's Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. A number of projects implemented in Kenya under BRI have positively contributed to environment protection and conservation, said Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan international relations scholar. The Nairobi Expressway, built in partnership with China Road and Bridge Corporation, has included the integration of plants along the pillars and walls of the road, to act as carbon sinks for the emissions produced on the expressway as well as the lower road. The Nairobi Global Trade Centre has adopted green building technologies to ensure it cushions the environment from harmful emissions. The tower uses low-E glass to reflect heat while letting light in, and a breathable curtain wall instead of air conditioners. It also pledged to be a plastic straw-free zone. Mostafa Kareem, a member of the faculty for irrigation and hydraulic engineering at Cairo University, spoke highly of BRI projects in Egypt such as the Central Business District (CBD) project in the new administrative capital and the Cairo light rail transit system. These initiatives are not only aimed at enhancing transportation and urban development but also at reducing emissions and supporting Egypt's goals for sustainable development, said Kareem. This photo taken on Sept. 11, 2023 shows the construction site of Central Business District (CBD) project in the new administrative capital, east of Cairo, Egypt. (XinhuaAhmed Gomaa) In partnership with China, Ethiopia is harnessing its massive solar energy potential by launching a research center to fast-track renewable energy development in the East African country. In June this year, with financial support from the Ministry of Commerce of China, the United Nations Development Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Energy of Ethiopia, the Administrative Center for China's Agenda 21, an affiliated entity of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and China Agricultural University, has implemented a project entitled Biogas, Biomass and Solar Trilateral Cooperation -- Transitioning to Sustainable Energy Uses in the Agro-industry between China and Ethiopia. The project primarily supports renewable energy technology dissemination and scale-up for Ethiopia's climate-resilient growth. Hence, the BRI is contributing reduction of carbon emission in Ethiopia, said Melaku Mulualem, senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Strategic Affairs. As the green transition in China is rolled out, Beijing has emphasized South-South cooperation in renewable energy projects. Technology transfer from China to the BRI countries has been scaled up. Throughout the 10 years of the existence of the collaborative initiative, a significant amount of work has been done related to solar energy and hydraulic resources built in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, said Eduardo Regalado, senior researcher at the International Policy Research Center of Cuba. Some claimed that the BRI would cause irreversible damage to land and water. However, experts and people involved in the actual projects in the host countries have drawn a different conclusion. Kenya is one of the African countries that are increasingly learning from the enviable experiences of China in terms of controlling desertification, said Adhere. Kenyan scientists at the Sino-Africa Joint Research Centre are working with counterparts from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography to help address the challenge of desertification not only in Kenya but also in northern African countries. The Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in Uganda is another example, said Jonathan Tabalanga, an international relations expert and lecturer at Uganda's Cavendish University. If you look at the Nambigirwa Bridge, the longest in the country (1.5 km), it preserved the environment. They did not pour sand, or soil waste in the swamp, but they created a bridge so that the water levels remain the same, explained Tabalanga. They always ensure that the issues of environment are taken care of. This photo taken on January 24, 2023 shows the Kingfisher oil field in Kikuube, Uganda. (Photo by Hajarah NalwaddaXinhua) Another example mentioned by Tabalanga is the Kingfisher oil project built in partnership with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in Uganda. Located in a complex ecological and residential environment, the company has been dedicated to employing technological means to minimize the project's impact on the surrounding environment. In the Oromia region of Ethiopia, the China-built Genale-Dawa III Multipurpose Hydropower Project aided in combating desertification through the provision of electricity to the nearby communities that had been dependent on firewood for their power demand. Several mini-projects were also conducted including the construction of bridges and ditches as part of an effort to prevent erosion and land degradation during the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway project. The communities living in China-built wind farms in different parts of Ethiopia also no longer contribute to desertification in their quest for power, said Mulualem. WELL-PREPARED ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Since its debut, the BRI has been conceptualized as the Green Belt and Road as the Chinese government is committed to sustainability, environmental protection, and international environmental standards. In 2015, the Belt and Road Initiative Action Plan was released by the Chinese government, outlining the vision and framework of the BRI and emphasizing the importance of environmental protection and sustainability in BRI projects. China and BRI participating countries have also established frameworks for conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Guidelines for BRI projects, which helped ensure that environmental concerns are addressed during project planning and implementation. At the first BRI Forum in 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that efforts should be made to strengthen cooperation in ecological and environmental protection and build a sound ecosystem to realize the goals set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme on building a green Belt and Road for 2017-2022, reached environmental cooperation agreements with more than 30 countries and international organizations, launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development together with 31 countries, and formed the BRI International Green Development Coalition with more than 150 partners from 40-plus countries. Before any BRI project kicks off in Ethiopia, the government of Ethiopia and experts from China conduct biodiversity assessment, incorporate principles related to biodiversity conservation into the BRI green finance framework, strengthen science-based support, and promote the consistency of standards and norms related to biodiversity conservation, said Mulualem. This photo taken on November 26, 2022 shows main gate of an underwater tunnel in Chattogram, Bangladesh. The underwater tunnel in Bangladesh built by a Chinese company has marked the civil works completion of its south tube. (Xinhua) All these international projects, including the Chinese (ones), done by international companies all go through an environmental impact assessment before the projects take shape. So, I think for the West to come out and argue that most of these projects impact the environment negatively is just wrong, said Tabalanga. All the development projects which were implemented earlier here have shown they have had a positive impact, especially in the environmental field in Bangladesh and are not posing a threat to our environment, said Barua, citing projects like the Padma Bridge, Elevated Expressway, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, and the Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant. Besides, China has promoted green finance, including green bonds and green investment practices, to fund environmentally friendly projects within the BRI framework. Green finance channels funds into renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which help reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating environmental impact and contributing to a more sustainable energy mix. Investments in green finance can also support infrastructure projects that focus on energy-efficient technologies and practices. This includes the construction of buildings with high energy efficiency standards and the implementation of smart infrastructure solutions. A case in point is the Global Trade Centre in Nairobi, said Adhere. Furthermore, green finance encourages the incorporation of technologies and designs that minimize carbon footprints. This photo taken on May 8, 2022 shows a section of the Nairobi Expressway built by China Road and Bridge Corporation in Nairobi, Kenya. (XinhuaDong Jianghui) This can include using low-carbon materials, improving transportation systems, and adopting sustainable construction practices. Examples implemented in Kenya under BRI include the SGR and the Nairobi Expressway, Adhere said.

They called the operation a success as they were able to prevent the vessel from capsizing and the fire from spreading to an adjacent warehouse. The fire was initially reported during the day on October 13 and continued to burn overnight and into the weekend. There were concerns due to the large volume of smoke emanating from the fire but it was mostly drifting over uninhabited areas while the fire department also sought to disperse the smoke. The 2,750 dwt vessel Ann Rousing arrived in Copenhagen overnight on October 13 coming from Odense, Denmark. The vessel, which was built in 1991 and registered in Denmark, was handling scrap metal. It is unclear from the reports if the fire started on the ship or from the scrap metal. The fire took 30 hours to control and extinguish (Hovedstadens Beredskab) Pictures issued by the fire department showed flames and large amounts of smoke coming from the 278-foot vessel's open cargo hold. The fire department reported that the cargo was burning violently. They were using water cannons both from the dock and the harbor in an effort to extinguish the fire. They were also assisted by a neighboring fire company and emergency service. After fighting the fire throughout the night, on October 14 they reported it had been reduced to a few small pockets but later in the day that it was finally considered out. However, the ship remained very hot with ongoing efforts to cool the structure and prevent the fire from re-igniting. They also began efforts to dewater the ship as it was increasingly listing raising concerns that it would capsize. They also strung a containment barrier as a precautionary measure.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The probe revealed that a result of the excessive vibration and the severe jolt, the brake pipe pressure dropped suddenly and the train derailed. A coach of a goods train going on the down line derailed at Dumraon railway station in the Buxar district, Bihar on Monday night. Senior officials have been apprised about the incident and operations to restore the rail services began, CPRO, East Central Railways (ECR) said. Earlier, at least four passengers died and 70 others got injured when six coaches of the Delhi-Kamakhya North East Express derailed near the Raghunathpur station in Buxar district on Wednesday night (October 11). The derailment occurred at 9:53 pm and at least two AC III Tier coaches had toppled over while four other coaches jumped the tracks. A Railway Police Force official said at least 70 passengers have been injured and shifted to local hospitals. Those with serious injuries were rushed to AIIMS, Patna. Will find the root because of derailment, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on X, even as he expressed condolences for the loss of lives. The minister said evacuation and rescue operations were completed and all coaches have been checked. The 23-coach 12506 North East Express had departed the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi at 7:40 am on Wednesday for its nearly 33-hour journey to Kamakhya, about six kilometres away from Guwahati. Reason of accident A fault in railway tracks was the possible because of derailment of all the coaches of the Delhi-Kamakhya North East Express in Bihar, sources said on Thursday citing a preliminary investigation report. It seems that derailment occurred due to fault in tracks, the report, signed by six railway officials, stated. However, other railway officials pointed out that the train was brought to a sudden halt by applying brakes when it was travelling at great speed. The guard of the Assam-bound train, Vijay Kumar, recalled that he felt brakes had been suddenly applied which was followed by jerks. I was busy with my paperwork when I realised that the driver suddenly applied brakes. This was followed by a few jerks and I fainted.

The truck driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon crash on Interstate 25, but on Monday the Pueblo County Coroner's Office said Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, Calif., died on scene. No other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. Photos and videos posted by authorities showed a partially collapsed bridge over the interstate with the semi-truck caught beneath in the right lane. The images also showed a pileup of train cars, train wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway near mile marker 107. The highway remained closed Monday. The Colorado Department of Transportation said it would be an extended closure. Local News Federal authorities will not investigate Union Pacific train derailment in Colorado Springs By Mary Shinn mary.shinngazette.com The train consisted of five locomotives and 124 cars carrying coal. A total of 30 cars derailed at milepost 109.7. A team of four NTSB investigators arrived on the scene today. The team comprises specialists in track discipline, mechanical discipline, and railroad operations. The team will also be in communication with NTSB highway safety experts at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. As part of this investigation, NTSB investigators will determine the probable because of the derailment and examine the adequacy of track inspections, oversight of track maintenance, the bridge's structure and maintenance, and any issues with rail equipment. A preliminary report will be available within 30 days, containing factual information gathered during the initial phase of the investigation. The final report, which is expected in 12-24 months, will detail the probable because of the accident and any contributing factors. The recommended detour between Colorado Springs and Pueblo is Colorado 115 and YOU.S. 50. Northbound traffic will have to divert off at exit 101 (YOU.S. 50 westbound). Southbound traffic is being diverted onto Overton Road via exit 110, according to State Patrol, which said to expect long delays. The bridge was built in 1958 according to Colorado Department of Transportation records, department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. BNSF owns the bridge and is responsible for inspecting it, he said. It was not immediately known whether the truck was caught beneath the collapsing bridge or if it somehow caused the collapse, Perez said. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site about 30 miles south of Denver.

Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing an ongoing investigation. Until investigators are able to assess the scene, it is unknown what the timeline for the highway's reopening will be, said Perez. Between 39,000 and 44,000 vehicles daily use I-25, according to Shipley. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations on the derailment and collapse. He said officials would be ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain them. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. A railroad bridge collapse along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana in June sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. That collapse remains under investigation and involved a steel truss bridge That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet, he said. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said just a few hours before Biden was set to take off for the trip that it would be rescheduled. The derailment near Pueblo comes less than a week after a train derailed October 9 in Colorado Springs. A Union Pacific Railroad train that was carrying Fort Carson equipment home from California went off the tracks on the south side of Colorado Springs. 4th Infantry Division spokesman Lt. Col. Joseph Payton said 13 cars were derailed -- five of them catastrophically, near the El Paso County jail along Las Vegas Street. The cars were carrying 15 pieces of Fort Carson equipment.

The train operator, BNSF Railway, said its personnel are assisting in the cleanup. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has begun its investigation at the scene, where 30 train cars derailed and caused a partial bridge collapse. Images of the scene posted online by the state patrol show several cars toppled over the side of the bridge and nearby embankment, blanketing the ground with coal. A semi-tractor trailer passing underneath the bridge at the time of the collapse became trapped between the bridge and coal cars, the federal agency said Monday.

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. It was unknown whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. Photos and videos posted by authorities showed the partially collapsed bridge with the semi-truck caught beneath in the right lane. The images also show a pileup of train cars and wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge was built in 1958 according to state records, department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. It was not immediately known whether the truck was caught beneath the collapsing bridge or if it somehow caused the collapse, Perez said. It was also unknown if the derailment or collapse came first. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site, which is just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said it was unlikely that the truck caused the accident because rail bridges are built sturdily and the truck would not have had enough force to knock it down. A more likely scenario, he said, is that part of the train derailed and slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that hold it up to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear and that state officials were going through their records to figure it out. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation.

The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem.

Meanwhile, the because behind the suspected leakage was yet to be ascertained. Police said they were trying to ascertain if the partially open space belonged to an agency or an individual. Late on Sunday night, residents living in a radius of 200 metres from the warehouse complained of a foul smell emanating from the unit located in C-block. Police said they received at least six calls in this regard by Monday morning. Initial inquiry revealed some drums containing chemicals were kept inside the warehouse, police said.

The Sunday afternoon incident sent train cars and coal falling onto the highway, killing a 60-year-old truck driver and closing I-25 indefinitely in both directions -- potentially for longer than a week. It may take up to two years for investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board to complete their work and release a final because for Sunday's derailment and bridge collapse, though an initial report should be released within a month, the NTSB said. The interstate cannot be cleaned up or reopened until investigators finish their on-site inspection, state and federal officials said Monday. That process is expected to take at least several days. In an interview, Shailen Bhatt, the leader of the Federal Highway Administration and a former head of the Colorado Department of Transportation until 2017, reiterated a state timeline that the closure could extend for days to weeks. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that state officials' immediate priority is safely getting the highway open both ways, but he cautioned the reopening would take time, given that the NTSB was in control of the site. (For the most up-to-date information on local and regional traffic detours, travelers should check CDOT's website and social media as well as cotrip.org.) The safety board said in a statement Monday afternoon that the derailment of the BNSF Railway-operated train caused the bridge to partially collapse, crushing the semi-truck and killing its driver. Thirty rail cars on the 124-car train derailed, spilling coal and debris across the interstate about four miles north of Pueblo. CDOT said six or seven train cars landed on the highway itself. Once the NTSB's initial field work is complete, it may take crews another two days to fully clear the debris, Polis said. A long line of trucks were arrayed near the scene Monday afternoon, waiting to begin clearing the scene. One driver said he would been waiting since midnight. Just being down here, you see all of the coal from the overturned train cars -- it is a significant recovery effort, Bhatt said of the work to come. Polis' statement expressed condolences for the truck driver and his family. He said he had spoken with YOU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and that the state was prepared to move as quickly as possible to reopen I-25 once given the green light. Our administration has been working for months to position Colorado to take advantage of the safety and rail investments that Congress and President Biden made possible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Polis said. Sadly, those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, but it is clear that federal funds for rail support are critical for Colorado. Questions remained Monday about who owned the rail bridge and who had inspection and oversight authority for it. The bridge did not have an official name, according to Sarah Sulick, a spokeswoman for the safety board. Initially, state officials said it was owned and operated by BNSF, which owns the train that derailed. Railroads typically own, inspect and maintain the tracks and bridges over which their trains run, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, with rail bridges numbering in the tens of thousands across the United States. The railroad administration also said BNSF owned the line. But the company told The Denver Post that the state owns the bridge, as did Bhatt, the federal highway administrator. CDOT spokesman Matt Inzeo said the agency still was trying to confirm who had responsibility for the bridge, noting that staff were digging through records going back to its construction in 1958. He confirmed that the state inspected the bridge in 2022, though he said the structure was not covered by federal rules requiring regular inspections. The bridge was a 188-foot-long, 14-foot-wide steel girder bridge, according to CDOT. Jaime Horowitz, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents at least one crew member on the derailed train, said he could not comment Monday because the union is part of the federal investigation team. There have been 11 train derailments in Colorado this year, all involving BNSF, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. The Texas-based railway and competitor Union Pacific together operate the vast majority of Colorado's more than 2,800 miles of railroad. BNSF has had 177 derailments derailments nationwide so far in 2023, federal data shows. Company spokeswoman Kendall Kirkham Sloan wrote in an email that the state owned the collapsed bridge but declined to comment further, beyond providing a statement confirming the derailment and the subsequent investigation. Bhatt said the White House had been informed of the derailment and interstate closure. Asked about potential causes, he deferred to the federal investigators, who are interviewing witnesses and reviewing video recordings. I would just say that this is being tracked at the highest levels, he said, and we are very aware of the national impacts of a closure of an interstate, but also the local impacts to Pueblo and other communities down here. The derailment comes as legislators here are taking a closer look at railroad safety and oversight in the wake of a February train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, that sparked a large fire and raised concerns about hazardous chemicals aboard. Two weeks ago, state lawmakers on the Transportation Legislation Review Committee approved a bill that would cap the length of trains in Colorado at 8,500 feet, require operators to maintain safety detectors and allow crew members to report safety concerns. Commercial rail incidents have become more frequent and with increased severity over the last decade, said Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat. And I think we are overdue for taking action to mitigate that, to put some safeguard into the commercial rail transportation network.

The election loss has been described in the media over the weekend as a bloodbath, horror show, utter devastation, a loss of biblical proportions, and a historic defeat. What are leftwing and progressive commentators saying about what went wrong and what Labour now needs to do? Labour's forgotten working class traditions Former Alliance president Matt McCarten, who was Labour's Chief of Staff under David Cunliffe and Andrew Little, is scathing about the current state of the Labour party, describing the party as disconnected from its voters, especially the poor and working class. McCarten told Newsroom's Aaron Smale that Labour has been taken over by middle class people and concerns: They look down on the working class. 'We love the poor, but they smell.' Because they are not part of them. They are in the leafy suburbs, the hip suburbs, the Grey Lynns of this world. And they do not live amongst the working class, they are not of them. They are missionaries. That is what Labour does, 'we do nice things for people. But we do not rock the establishment, we do not rock the middle classes. We keep them quiet'. According to McCarten, the Labour Party reflects a global tendency for leftwing political movements to eschew the working class in favour of managerialism and social issues, which means it can no longer articulate the problems and solutions of ordinary people. He says from the Helen Clark era onwards, the best Labour has been able to offer is to manage capitalism better than National and be nicer: They are not visionaries, they are just nice people. Well fck that, when you are poor, you do not care if they are nice or not nice. You just want hope. Leftwing political commentator Josie Pagani agrees, writing in the Post that Labour has lost its class focus: The priorities of traditional Labour supporters, working people on low incomes, were put lower on the agenda than the priorities of the urban middle class. Jacinda Ardern was willing to spend 678 million to subsidise businesses to decarbonise, for example, but said free dental care, at roughly the same cost, was an unaffordable dream. She argues Labour can no longer be identified with any great causes. Similarly, leftwing political writer Max Rashbrooke tweeted in the weekend that Labour has lost its identity and purpose, and this was a problem before the party won power in 2017: Labour did not have a clear set of priorities or a coherent view of the world it wanted. Had not done the work in opposition; and like global counterparts, unsure what being 'Labour' means now. As a result, Rashbrooke says Labour does not focus enough on the needs of working people: The failure to do anything meaningful on the colossal modern issue of insecure work - even though helping 'labour' is literally in the name - is especially striking and speaks to a long term failure of nerve, vision and willingness to shift the narrative on key issues. Priorities were never clear, except when they really dug in on something - like 3 Waters - and people went, 'Oh, so that is a priority. Who knew?' He says the Labour needs a deep rethink of its core ideology, strategy and policies. A failure to focus on economics Labour's disconnect from the importance of the economy and people's day-to-day struggles was epitomised by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's insistence that no cost of living crisis was occurring under her watch. By the time the election rolled around, it became all about the state of the economy and living standards and, according to Listener writer Danyl Mclauchlan, Labour never managed to grasp this: After promising to focus on the cost of living, Labour delivered piecemeal handouts - subscription subsidies, the GST exemption - which were more than cancelled out by their increases in fuel taxes. In a campaign in which the nation demanded change, Hipkins promised stasis. The Spinoff's Hayden Donnell also cites Hipkins' decision to reject radical tax reform for Labour's demise: Hipkins' 'captain's call' sealed off election opportunities for Labour.... Without real tax relief to offer people on lower incomes, Hipkins became a salesman with nothing to sell. And Donnell says that this was a real problem during a cost of living crisis: When it came time to present his alternative, Hipkins could only offer 45c off parsnips and some free dental for some people in three years' time. Leftwing political commentator Gordon Campbell also singles out Labour's weak economic policies as one of the main reasons the public lost faith in the government. In his column he argues the 2020 administration had a mandate to carry out the radical left wing surgery that the country's various ills required. Campbell lists what this might have looked like: A more radical agenda could have included a capital gains tax, a wealth tax, meaningful anti-trust action against the virtual cartels being run by banks and supermarkets, a windfall tax on their profits, making Working for Families income supports available to beneficiary families, funding Kiwibank so that it can compete significantly with the Aussie banks etc etc. Constitutional and co-governance reform If Labour was less focused on traditional leftwing, economic or working class concerns, then what has been the party's reform programme while in government? Some critics on the left have identified co-governance and related decolonisation agendas as filling the void in Labour's reform agenda, arguing that Labour's Mori caucus became increasingly dominant in the government and determined to deliver a radicalism that would help retain their seats from the revived Te Pati Mori. For example, writing for the Interest website, Chris Trotter paints a picture of the 2017-2023 government being equally as radical as David Lange's Fourth Labour Government, and having now been punished in a similar way to the 1990s when Labour's vote plummeted and even Phil Goff lost his Mt Roskill seat to National. But whereas the LangeDouglas Government was radical in terms of a rightwing economics programme, Trotter suggests the ArdernHipkins Government was radical in terms of wholesale constitutional reform and co-governance in particular - that were growing out of the Crown's newfound commitment to 'indigenisation' and 'decolonisation'. Trotter argues that Labour never managed - or even tried - to take the public along with its big reforms, seeking to suppress debate rather than openly communicate their changes: Massive changes in education and health policy were introduced without adequate explanation or justification. Jarring changes in the linguistic structure of official communications were implemented without consultation, leaving many New Zealanders feeling culturally disoriented and politically ignored. Although the Herald's Simon Wilson supports co-governance, he also blames Labour's approach to implementing this policy, saying good people felt estranged by co-governance. As with many of its other reforms, Wilson suggests that Labour did so in a top-down way, failing to take communities with them. Covid-19 and conservatism Wilson wrote that Covid-19 was partly responsible for Labour's demise, as the pandemic's hangover lingered: The social trauma has been far deeper and more widespread than expected. And he also blames Hipkins for not being bolder: He failed to grasp that voters who want change actually do want change and will not settle for trivialities. GST off the veges, but no structural tax reform? Was it a joke? Nope. It was a betrayal. Wilson also makes the very good point that Labour's fear of boldness and change was actually self-defeating, because voters did want action: Labour was scared of change. One of the great fallacies in politics is that there is a big middle ground of voters who like quiet moderation. Actually, voters want things to be better. Those who swing from one party to another are not looking to reinforce the status quo. They have become disillusioned and want a shake-up. Progressive business journalist Bernard Hickey argues that Labour's loss came from its desire to go into government promising great transformation that could not be delivered by remaining economically orthodox: Labour lost the 2023 election in 2017 when it committed to the Budget Responsibility Rules, while also committing to 100,000 Kiwibuild homes, the Auckland CBD-Airport rail line, welfare reform and a capital gains tax review. They were incompatible and the inevitable disappointment upon failing on Kiwibuild, light rail, and welfare reform. He believes that the government's Covid response was an additional factor in its demise: The revolt against government over the Covid restrictions in late 2021 punctured that 2020 election bubble. Listener writer Danyl Mclauchlan also cites Covid and failure to deliver on promises: Hipkins was indirectly responsible for much of his party's decline. He was minister for Covid, and the early phase was a triumph that voters rewarded in 2020. But 2021 saw one of the slowest vaccine rollouts in the OECD after the government failed to negotiate purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies. The lack of vaccine coverage led to the sustained Auckland lockdown of late 2021, a policy failure that the nation's largest city has punished them for by delivering a number of Labour's safest seats to National. Mt Roskill and New Lynn have fallen, Mt Albert and Te Atat look set to fall. Hipkins was also minister for health, education, police and public service: all areas in which his government's legacy is questionable at best. What happens next for Labour? It is clear that Labour now needs to do a lot of soul-searching, or even to rediscover its political and ideological soul. Unfortunately, the Labour caucus is rather lacking in personnel at the moment who might achieve this. Gordon Campbell argues that Hipkins' replacement cannot be Grant Robertson, who is not only past his 'use by' date, but has been more part of the problem than part of the solution, starting with his decision to bind Labour to Blairite budget constraints. He nominates David Parker as the best option among Labour's surviving roster of senior MPs who might have the will and the ability to shift Labour back in the leftwards direction necessary, and he is the only potential leader able to sort out Labour's pressing existential problem of deciding what its purpose is. Other leadership options currently being talked about include Carmel Sepuloni, Peeni Henare, and Barbara Edmonds. Whoever is chosen, Campbell recommends that they keep away from the lobbyists, businesspeople, and focus groups Labour has relied upon so heavily for the last six years in power. Only then will Labour be able to reconnect with its traditional values. Simon Wilson says Labour faces the existential question: What is the point of Labour in the 2020s? He suggests the problem is that the party is against change, and unfortunately, the political right has now claimed the role of giving optimism and hope to ordinary people. According to Josie Pagani, Labour needs significant renewal, and to reach outside the party for debate and ideas - something she says the party has not done for a long time. Finally, she offers the following example of how complacency can be fatal: The French Socialist party is a salutary reminder of the alternative. After many decades in and out of government, the party cratered on just 1.75 percent of the vote in 2022. Parties that do not change sometimes disappear.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

It caused a major scene with spilled coal and mangled rail cars on the roadways for over 24 hours. This massive pileup presented a larger issue within the state's rail system and its overall safety. It is unclear whether the train derailed first or if the bridge collapse caused the crash, but whatever the because, Colorado lawmakers say something must be done. Colorado state Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, D-Pueblo, first heard about the massive scene while traveling down the very interstate where the train derailed and the bridge collapsed Sunday afternoon as he headed home from Fort Collins with his son. Train length limits proposed He is already on the Transportation Legislative Review Committee, or TLRC, which voted earlier this month to approve legislation for the upcoming session to address rail system safety. The proposals include limiting train length, which Hinrichsen said has been changing within the industry. The bigger the train, the more tonnage of cargo, the longer the span, the more you are opening up to issues, the more time you have grades or spans that have continuous pressure on them. So you have 2 miles of train rather than a mile of train crossing that bridge, Hinrichsen said. The legislators also plan on increasing safety inspections, which would include detectors to identify train defects. Colorado has fortunately been able to avoid a large impact, and we are not avoiding that anymore. And I think we need to realize that and we need to take that seriously, as we have to make adjustments and we have to get real safety right going forward, Hinrichson said. Polis on rail safety rules FOX31 asked Gov. Jared Polis' office if he would support more rail regulation. They said the governor will review and comment on specific legislation through the legislative process when the state house is back in session. The governor also pointed out that Colorado has gotten more than 4 billion from the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That money could help repair rails and bridges across the state. Our administration has been working for months to position Colorado to take advantage of the safety and rail investments that Congress and President Biden made possible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Polis said. Sadly, those improvements come too late to prevent this incident, but it is clear that federal funds for rail support are critical for Colorado.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. It was unknown whether any other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. Photos and videos posted by authorities showed the partially collapsed bridge with the semi-truck caught beneath in the right lane. The images also show a pileup of train cars and wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway. A nine-mile stretch of I-25 -- the main north-south road corridor in Colorado, used by 39,000 to 44,000 vehicles daily -- was shut down in what the Colorado Department of Transportation said Monday would be an extended closure. The bridge was built in 1958 according to state records, department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. It was not immediately known whether the truck was caught beneath the collapsing bridge or if it somehow caused the collapse, Perez said. It was also unknown if the derailment or collapse came first. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site, which is just north of Pueblo and about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. Former NTSB accident investigator Russell Quimby said it was unlikely that the truck caused the accident because rail bridges are built sturdily and the truck would not have had enough force to knock it down. A more likely scenario, he said, is that part of the train derailed and slammed into the side of the bridge, causing the girders that hold it up to be displaced and causing the bridge to fall. Potential sabotage or vandalism also will be looked at by investigators, he said. Usually that is pretty obvious, Quimby said. If they find something that looks like some kind of vandalism or foul play, they would call in the FBI and it would become a crime scene. There was some confusion over who owned the bridge. Wilson said early Monday that it was BNSF's bridge and the railroad was responsible for inspecting it. But Wilson later said the ownership was unclear and that state officials were going through their records to figure it out. A BNSF spokesperson said it was owned by the state. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing the ongoing investigation. Until investigators are able to assess the scene, it is unknown what the timeline for the highway's reopening will be, Perez said. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations, which are ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain them. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. Sunday's accident follows a railroad bridge collapse in June along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana that sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. The collapse, which remains under investigation, involved a steel truss bridge. That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. Despite the two recent accidents, Quimby said it is extremely unusual for rail bridges to collapse. Quimby said bridges are key pieces of railroad networks and companies have a vested interest in properly maintaining them. Some railroad bridges are more than a century old but still in good repair, he said. The railroads take much better care of their bridges than our government does of our road and highway bridges, he said. If you have a bridge out, that is a major problem.

The SP 500 climbed 1.1 percent Monday. The Dow rose 0.93 percent percent, and the Nasdaq composite added 1.2 percent. Treasury yields rose after tumbling last week on worries that fighting in Gaza will escalate. Crude oil prices dropped, and gold also slipped as last week's flight toward safer investments waned.

Rite Aid seeks bankruptcy to deal with suits, losses NEW YORK -- Rite Aid has filed for bankruptcy protection and plans to sell part of its business as it attempts to restructure while dealing with losses and opioid-related lawsuits. The company said Rite Aid stores will continue to fill prescriptions, and customers will still be able to visit its locations or shop online while it goes through the reorganization. But that process also will allow it to speed up its plan to close underperforming stores and will help significantly reduce the company's debt while helping to resolve litigation claims in an equitable manner, Rite Aid late October 15. Rite Aid Corp. runs more than 2,100 stores in the YOU.S., mostly on the East and West Coasts, and has posted annual losses for several years. The company no longer has any retail presence in South Carolina. The company, which is marking its 60th birthday this year, has been cutting costs and closing some stores as it has dealt with long-standing financial challenges. The company, like its rivals, also faces financial risk from lawsuits over opioid prescriptions. Rite Aid already has reached several settlements, including a deal announced last year with the state of West Virginia for up to 30 million. Pfizer trims outlook as Covid vax sales weaken NEW YORK -- Pfizer is cutting its full-year outlook, citing declining sales of its COVID-19-related products. The company said October 16 that it now foresees 2023 revenue in a range of 58 billion to 61 billion, down from 67 billion to 70 billion. It now projects full-year adjusted earnings between 1.45 and 1.65 per share due to lower-than-anticipated revenue for Covid-19-related products and inventory write-offs. The company previously expected 3.25 to 3.45 per share. JPMorgan said the company's update solves an ongoing YOU.S. Paxlovid inventory debate and it anticipates the company's bigger-than-expected cuts to its sales projections will help put a floor under per-share earnings expectations for next year. Canadian car plant workers ratify GM offer TORONTO -- Canadian autoworkers have voted to ratify a three-year contract agreement with General Motors. Members of Unifor, the union representing about 4,300 Canadian workers at three Ontario GM facilities, voted 80.5 percent in favor of the deal, the union said October 15. The vote followed the pattern of an agreement reached earlier with Ford, and it leaves only Jeep maker Stellantis without a contract. Talks have yet to start with Stellantis, which has the largest Canadian manufacturing footprint of Detroit's three automakers. The GM agreement came after a brief strike last week by the workers at GM factories in Oshawa and St. Catharines, Ontario, and a parts warehouse in Woodstock, Ontario. GM says in a statement that the deal recognizes worker contributions while positioning the company to be competitive in the future. Unifor said that the deal includes pay raises of nearly 20 percent for production workers and 25 percent for skilled trades. Workers would get 10 percent in general pay raises in the first year, with 2 percent in the second and 3 percent in the third. The company also agreed to restore cost-of-living pay raises starting in December of 2024. Temporary workers would get pay raises, and those with at least one year of service would get permanent jobs. In the YOU.S., strikes continue by the United Auto Workers union with nearly 34,000 workers off their jobs at all three Detroit companies. Ford chair says carmaker's future at stake DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. executive chairman Bill Ford called on autoworkers to come together and end a monthlong strike that he says could cost the company the ability to invest in the future. In a rare speech during contract talks in Dearborn, Mich., Ford said high labor costs could limit future investments. The great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford said that will cost many jobs and America will also lose. The company is near an impasse with the United Auto Workers union, which walked out at targeted Detroit Three factories on Sept. 15.

The incident is under investigation. Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez told the Associated Press (AP) Monday that no other vehicles were involved: During the incident, a bridge partially collapsed over the interstate, and the truck was trapped underneath. A massive amount of coal was also spilled onto the roadway. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. ... President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said just a few hours before Biden was set to take off for the trip that it would be rescheduled. Colorado State Patrol Major Brian Lyons told reporters the incident happened at Milepost 107. He added that officials were working to make sure the scene was safe as responding agencies investigated. When a reporter asked him how it happened, Lyons said, That is going to be something over the next couple days that we are going to be working with our state and federal partners to determine exactly how this occurred. In a social media post on Sunday evening, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg addressed the situation. In touch with Gov. Polis and have been briefed by Federal Railroad  Federal Highway Administrations on a BNSF coal train derailment  bridge collapse affecting I-25 near Pueblo, CO, he stated: He later said, State  local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected. Buttigieg has faced controversy over transportation issues across the nation. A Rasmussen Reports survey from March found a majority of likely voters want him to resign for his handling of the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, Breitbart News reported on March 13. Buttigieg was slow to respond to train derailment in the Buckeye State, only opting to visit the area after former President Trump made an effort, the latter of whom made sure that the people of the area knew they were not forgotten, the outlet said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

An in-principle deal that ended weeks of strikes in September fell apart earlier this month after unions said Chevron had reneged on commitments and vowed to resume strikes at the Gorgon and Wheatstone sites, which supply around 6 of the world's LNG. Australia's industrial arbitrator, the Fair Work Commission, mediated three days of talks last week and asked the Offshore Alliance to withdraw the strike plan while talks continued, Chevron said. As a fourth day of talks began, a union representative who declined to be named, told Reuters the parties were apart on key issues and Chevron would need to change its position to avoid strikes restarting. The Offshore Alliance, a coalition of two unions, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chevron said unions continued to introduce new matters into the dispute and were withholding agreement on other issues pending member votes. Members have made it clear that they want Chevron to stop twisting the draft terms of our EBA's (enterprise bargaining agreements) and are prepared to ramp up PIA (protected industrial action) until our EBA's are properly sorted, the post read. Chevron said late on Sunday it was extremely disappointed by the vote to stick with the strike plan, against the arbitrator's request. The union's decision to ignore the recommendation ... while discussions are continuing is very concerning, unreasonable and undermines the considerable progress made prior to Chevron requesting the Commission's assistance last week, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Summary The characters in the Netflix series The Fall of the House of Usher have significant nmes that connect to Poe's stories and poems. Many of the characters in the show face fates similar to their on-page counterparts, adding a dark twist to their storylines. The names of the characters hold deeper meanings that align with their personalities and actions throughout the series. Roderick Usher has six children who are dead by the end of The Fall of the House of Usher, and all of them have significant names. Since the Netflix show is based on Edgar Allen Poe's story of the same name, it is no surprise there are dark twists throughout its eight episodes. The characters in the show are spoiled and entitled, but they all get their comeuppance by The Fall of the House of Usher's ending. Their deaths are even connected to the meanings behind their names. Characters in a show based on Poe's work certainly could not have ordinary names, and The Fall of the House of Usher ensures they do not. In fact, all the names come from Poe's stories and poems. And although not every character faces a fate similar to their on-page counterpart, some of them do. This is a pretty clever way of honoring Poe and fans of his work in Netflix's The Fall of the House of Usher. From the youngest kid to all of Roderick illegitimate children, every character has a deeper meaning behind their name. Frederick Usher Frederick Usher was named after Frederick from Poe's first printed short story, Metzengerstein: A Tale in Imitation of the German. In German, Frederick is known to mean peace or peaceful ruler, which is ironic, as nothing about the Usher family suggests they live in peace. In Metzengerstein, Frederick exhibits cruel behavior due to his immense power at a young age. In the end, he dies in a fire after entering a burning castle. This is pretty similar to how Frederick dies in The Fall Of The House Of Usher: in the demolition of a building. However, Frederick's death is also inspired by Poe's story The Pit and The Pendulum. Tamerlane Usher In The Fall of the House Of Usher, Tamerlane Usher runs her own wellness brand. However, Tamerlane does not practice what she preaches, and she is pretty terrible to her husband. She dies a gruesome death after smashing the mirrors in her bedroom. The Usher child's name comes from Poe's poem, Tamerlane, which is about a ruler who sacrifices love for power. This plays well into the new Netflix series, which is seemingly all about power and money. The name itself is typically used for men, but it translates to power and resilience, two things Tamerlane strives for throughout the series. Victorine Lafourcade Victorine Lafourcade is one of Roderick Usher's illegitimate children. Her death is based on Poe's story The Tell-Tale Heart, but her name comes from a different story. Victorine dies in a murder-suicide after killing her girlfriend, who wants to expose her family. In the Poe story The Premature Burial, Victorine is accidentally buried alive by her lover, causing the narrator to also fear being buried alive. In Latin, Victorine means victory -- and while the Usher child does die, she is victorious in stopping her girlfriend from exposing her family. Camille L'Espanaye Camille L'Espanaye is also an illegitimate child of Roderick and runs public relations for the family. Camille's name comes from Poe's short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue. In the story, a woman and her daughter, Camille, are murdered by an orangutan after escaping a sailor's capture. This is pretty close to how Camille is killed in The Fall of the House of Usher, as she goes to Victorine's lab and is murdered by monkeys. Camille has French origins and is said to mean priest's helper, which connects to the way Camille is Roderick's helper, aiding him in controlling the public image of the family. Napoleon Leo Usher Napoleon Leo Usher is inspired by a character in Edgar Allen Poe's story The Black Cat. However, his name actually comes from another Poe story: The Spectacles. In the story, Napoleon is nearly tricked into marrying his great-great-grandmother. This is not showcased in The Fall of the House of Usher. Instead, Napoleon is dating a man named Julius, and he dies when he falls out the window of their apartment. The name Napoleon has many origins but is seemingly based on the Napoleon Complex (named after Napoleon Bonaparte), which the Usher family certainly has. Prospero Perry Usher Prospero Perry Usher is the youngest Usher to die and the first to be killed by Verna. Prospero hosts a wild party at a warehouse, which ends in him and most of his guests dying from acid rain. The masquerade party Prospero hosts comes straight from the Poe story The Masque of the Red Death. In The Masque of the Red Death, Prince Prospero hosts a masquerade party to avoid a plague, but he is killed by a masked figure during the festivities. Prospero translates to prosperous or fortunate, and while the character dies an unfortunate death in The Fall of the House of Usher, he does live a lavish life while he is alive. As the youngest, he is quite flashy, unapologetically showing up at his brother's wife's house in a fancy car and inviting her to his party. Lenore Usher Lenore is not Roderick's child. She is actually Frederick's daughter, making her Roderick's granddaughter. Lenore is different from the rest of the characters in The Fall of the House of Usher, as she is relatively innocent and does not deserve to die. Roderick even feels that Lenore shares positive qualities with his first wife, Annabel Lee. Lenore is based on the character from the Edgar Allen Poe poem The Raven. In the story, the main character is visited by a raven while mourning the death of his love, Lenore. The name Lenore has been interpreted as meaning shining light, which fits Lenore's character well, as she is the only decent member of the main family in The Fall of the House of Usher. Lenore gets a much more peaceful death than her relatives, which also fits well with her name. Unfortunately, the fact that she is an Usher means that her life cannot be spared. The way Roderick is haunted by Lenore's death is similar to the main character in The Raven who is mourning their love. It is also a nice way to pay homage to Poe's work in the Netflix series The Fall of the House of Usher.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

A queer professor at Arizona State University was allegedly left bloodied after an altercation broke out last week between him and two members of a conservative group, in what authorities are investigating as a hate crime. David Boyles -- who teaches English and is the co-founder of Drag Story Hour Arizona -- was confronted on ASU's campus by two men with the right-wing group Turning Point USA on Wednesday. The next day the group posted online a 96-second video showing Boyles being followed by a cameraman and a personality named Kalen D'Almeida firing contentious questions regarding his work with Drag Story Hour. Drag Story Hour is a national group with local chapters across the country that organizes events where drag performers read children's books to kids at bookstores, libraries, LGBTQ centers and other public venues. You cannot run, D'Almeida said. It is best if you just talk to me on why you want to push sodomy to young people. The Turning Point USA video shows Boyles ignoring the men until the end of the clip, when Boyles appears to strike the camera and the video cuts out. Security footage released by law enforcement shows Boyles striking the camera and D'Almeida subsequently pushing Boyles to the floor, causing him to hit his face. Police told KPNX-TV, an NBC affiliate based in Mesa, Arizona, that they are investigating the confrontation as a potential bias or prejudicially motivated incident. A spokesperson for the Arizona State University Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for an update on the case. Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet told the local outlet that the cameraman plans to file a police report because of the altercation. Boyles posted a photo on Facebook last week showing the left side of his face bloodied. My physical injuries are relatively minor and I am doing ok, Boyles wrote. But I am also feeling angry, violated, embarrassed, and despairing at the fact that we have come to normalize this kind of harassment and violence against anyone who tries to support LGBTQ youth (ironically the topic of the class I had just finished teaching) or just LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups in general. He added, Whether it is bomb threats against children's hospitals and libraries, a store owner being killed for her pride flag, or the now standard rhetoric that anyone who supports LGBTQ youth is a 'groomer,' it has to stop. On Saturday, ASU President Dr. Michael Crow condemned the altercation in a letter posted on the university's website. It is astounding to me that individuals from Turning Point USA would wait for an ASU instructor to come out of his class to follow him, harass him and ultimately shove him to the ground, bloodying his face, Crow said. The ASU incident comes as anti-LGBTQ demonstrations and attacks have spiked in the last year across the country. From June 2022 to May, there was an average of 39 anti-LGBTQ protests per month, compared with just three per month from January 2017 through May 2022, according to a recent report by the Crowd Counting Consortium, a research group that tracks political protests. Additionally, there have been several high-profile acts of violence allegedly incited by anti-LGBTQ sentiments in recent months, including multiple bomb threats. In July, the fatal stabbing of a 28-year-old gay professional dancer, O'Shae Sibley in Brooklyn, New York, made national headlines. Police later deemed the stabbing hate crime. Similarly, the killing of Laura Ann Carleton, a California business owner and mother of nine, sent shock waves around the nation. Carleton was fatally shot during an altercation over a Pride flag displayed in her clothing store. Last month, police in Salt Lake City, Utah, New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, all responded to separate bomb threats to LGBTQ spaces or events within the same weekend.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Unlike America's various ballistic missile defense, designed to shoot down small numbers of nuclear-tipped missiles incoming from China, Russia, or some rogue state like North Korea or Iran, Iron Dome is a strictly local affair. In service since 2011, Iron Dome is a truck-towed, mobile air defense system whose primary job is shooting down Hamas and Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israeli cities. The problem with Iron Dome is that while homemade missiles like Hamas and Hezbollah use are inexpensive, antimissile missiles run up to 150,000 a pop, and each missile battery costs about 50 million to manufacture. The costs do not exactly work in Jerusalem's favor. ASIDE: For the record, MTG never used the phrase Jewish space lasers. But, before she was elected to Congress, she did once share on Facebook a rumor about the possibility that secret lasers controlled by the Rothschilds -- intended to clear land for then-Gov. Jerry Brown's high-speed rail project -- had started a series of deadly wildfires. I have no room to criticize because my entire Twitter feed is one disqualification from public office after another. Enter, Israelis with fricken laser beams. Iron Beam is a: 100kW class High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS). It is designed to intercept a wide range of threats such as Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM) and UAVs. Israeli defense firm Rafael revealed Iron Beam at the Singapore Airshow in 2014. Its job is to defend at ranges too short for Iron Dome -- and for a lot less money, too. Firing a laser beam and an incoming projectile costs just 2,000. Cheap at twice the price! Just a year ago, Defense News reported that deployment had slipped to at least 2024, maybe 2025. Could Rafael speed things up in time for use during the current conflict? Rafael exec Michael Lurie told Defense News back then, We do not have a technology problem or a scientific problem anymore... it is now an engineering problem. Maybe they have rushed things along enough over the last 12 months to produce a working prototype but I would not bet money on that I could not afford to lose. But I would wager a mortgage payment that the IDF has at least one working battery in time for the next major war. What does it all mean? It means that Israel is taking one more step towards fulfilling the prophecy of the great Mel Brooks.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Amid appreciation and applause from the host countries, there are some discordant voices in the West alleging that those projects have posed negative impacts on the environment. No doubt, such opinions were misguided and need to be critically examined. PRESERVING BIO-DIVERSITY RATHER THAN DESTROYING Before 2022, travelers from northern Croatia had to pass through a 9-km stretch of Bosnia and Herzegovina's coast to reach Ston, a small town located at Peljesac, a sun-drenched peninsula in southern Croatia. The construction of the Peljesac bridge, a BRI project, shortened the distance, but also made local oyster farmers worry that it would affect the production of shellfish, which has been inscribed into the European Union (EU) Geographical Indications Register. However, the Chinese companies that built the bridge have always adhered to the highest environmental standards, and the local farmers told me that the production and quality of oysters have not been affected at all, and the bridge has actually boosted their sales, said Qi Qianjin, Chinese ambassador to Croatia. Actually, environmental conservation measures, such as water protection and management, noise control, and the construction of bridges to ensure the safe passage of wildlife, have been widely employed in BRI projects. In Kenya, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) runs through some sensitive ecosystems such as national parks. The project has designed several wildlife corridors, including seven bridges, several culverts, and embankments to funnel wildlife to the underpasses to reduce the risk of train-wildlife collision. Noise absorbers are also installed along the wildlife corridors to reduce possible disturbance of the animals. It is one of the most important projects where BRI has made substantial efforts to lower impacts on ecologically vulnerable areas, said Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan international relations scholar. In many BRI host countries, traditional dependence on fossil fuels caused air pollution, harmed people's health, and created a dilemma between reducing carbon emissions and economic development. Committed to open, green and clean cooperation towards inclusive and sustainable development, the BRI incorporates many projects designated to promote clean and renewable energy, such as wind farms, solar power plants, and eco-friendly transportation systems. Through BRI projects our government has taken different projects for the reduction of carbon emission and transition to green energy sources in our country, said Dilip Barua, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist). The former Bangladeshi industries minister said China had assisted his country in constructing several solar power plants, such as the Cox's Bazar wind power project, being environmentally friendly energy sources. The recently inaugurated Cox's Bazar wind power project, a flagship initiative invested by Wuling Power Corp. and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp., marked a major milestone in Bangladesh's quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy. The wind power project is located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from the capital Dhaka. Upon operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 metric tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 metric tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households. It is a major watershed in our nation's journey towards cleaner and more sustainable energy, said Md. Habibur Rahman, senior secretary of Power Division under Bangladesh's Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. A number of projects implemented in Kenya under BRI have positively contributed to environment protection and conservation, said Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan international relations scholar. The Nairobi Expressway, built in partnership with China Road and Bridge Corporation, has included the integration of plants along the pillars and walls of the road, to act as carbon sinks for the emissions produced on the expressway as well as the lower road. The Nairobi Global Trade Centre has adopted green building technologies to ensure it cushions the environment from harmful emissions. The tower uses low-E glass to reflect heat while letting light in, and a breathable curtain wall instead of air conditioners. It also pledged to be a plastic straw-free zone. Mostafa Kareem, a member of the faculty for irrigation and hydraulic engineering at Cairo University, spoke highly of BRI projects in Egypt such as the Central Business District (CBD) project in the new administrative capital and the Cairo light rail transit system. These initiatives are not only aimed at enhancing transportation and urban development but also at reducing emissions and supporting Egypt's goals for sustainable development, said Kareem. In partnership with China, Ethiopia is harnessing its massive solar energy potential by launching a research center to fast-track renewable energy development in the East African country. In June this year, with financial support from the Ministry of Commerce of China, the United Nations Development Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Energy of Ethiopia, the Administrative Center for China's Agenda 21, an affiliated entity of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and China Agricultural University, has implemented a project entitled Biogas, Biomass and Solar Trilateral Cooperation -- Transitioning to Sustainable Energy Uses in the Agro-industry between China and Ethiopia. The project primarily supports renewable energy technology dissemination and scale-up for Ethiopia's climate-resilient growth. Hence, the BRI is contributing reduction of carbon emission in Ethiopia, said Melaku Mulualem, senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Strategic Affairs. As the green transition in China is rolled out, Beijing has emphasized South-South cooperation in renewable energy projects. Technology transfer from China to the BRI countries has been scaled up. Throughout the 10 years of the existence of the collaborative initiative, a significant amount of work has been done related to solar energy and hydraulic resources built in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, said Eduardo Regalado, senior researcher at the International Policy Research Center of Cuba. Some claimed that the BRI would cause irreversible damage to land and water. However, experts and people involved in the actual projects in the host countries have drawn a different conclusion. Kenya is one of the African countries that are increasingly learning from the enviable experiences of China in terms of controlling desertification, said Adhere. Kenyan scientists at the Sino-Africa Joint Research Centre are working with counterparts from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography to help address the challenge of desertification not only in Kenya but also in northern African countries. The Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in Uganda is another example, said Jonathan Tabalanga, an international relations expert and lecturer at Uganda's Cavendish University. If you look at the Nambigirwa Bridge, the longest in the country (1.5 km), it preserved the environment. They did not pour sand, or soil waste in the swamp, but they created a bridge so that the water levels remain the same, explained Tabalanga. They always ensure that the issues of environment are taken care of. Another example mentioned by Tabalanga is the Kingfisher oil project built in partnership with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in Uganda. Located in a complex ecological and residential environment, the company has been dedicated to employing technological means to minimize the project's impact on the surrounding environment. In the Oromia region of Ethiopia, the China-built Genale-Dawa III Multipurpose Hydropower Project aided in combating desertification through the provision of electricity to the nearby communities that had been dependent on firewood for their power demand. Several mini-projects were also conducted including the construction of bridges and ditches as part of an effort to prevent erosion and land degradation during the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway project. The communities living in China-built wind farms in different parts of Ethiopia also no longer contribute to desertification in their quest for power, said Mulualem. WELL-PREPARED ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Since its debut, the BRI has been conceptualized as the Green Belt and Road as the Chinese government is committed to sustainability, environmental protection, and international environmental standards. In 2015, the Belt and Road Initiative Action Plan was released by the Chinese government, outlining the vision and framework of the BRI and emphasizing the importance of environmental protection and sustainability in BRI projects. China and BRI participating countries have also established frameworks for conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Guidelines for BRI projects, which helped ensure that environmental concerns are addressed during project planning and implementation. At the first BRI Forum in 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that efforts should be made to strengthen cooperation in ecological and environmental protection and build a sound ecosystem to realize the goals set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme on building a green Belt and Road for 2017-2022, reached environmental cooperation agreements with more than 30 countries and international organizations, launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development together with 31 countries, and formed the BRI International Green Development Coalition with more than 150 partners from 40-plus countries. Before any BRI project kicks off in Ethiopia, the government of Ethiopia and experts from China conduct biodiversity assessment, incorporate principles related to biodiversity conservation into the BRI green finance framework, strengthen science-based support, and promote the consistency of standards and norms related to biodiversity conservation, said Mulualem. All these international projects, including the Chinese (ones), done by international companies all go through an environmental impact assessment before the projects take shape. So, I think for the West to come out and argue that most of these projects impact the environment negatively is just wrong, said Tabalanga. All the development projects which were implemented earlier here have shown they have had a positive impact, especially in the environmental field in Bangladesh and are not posing a threat to our environment, said Barua, citing projects like the Padma Bridge, Elevated Expressway, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, and the Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant. Besides, China has promoted green finance, including green bonds and green investment practices, to fund environmentally friendly projects within the BRI framework. Green finance channels funds into renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which help reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating environmental impact and contributing to a more sustainable energy mix. Investments in green finance can also support infrastructure projects that focus on energy-efficient technologies and practices. This includes the construction of buildings with high energy efficiency standards and the implementation of smart infrastructure solutions. A case in point is the Global Trade Centre in Nairobi, said Adhere. Furthermore, green finance encourages the incorporation of technologies and designs that minimize carbon footprints. This can include using low-carbon materials, improving transportation systems, and adopting sustainable construction practices. Examples implemented in Kenya under BRI include the SGR and the Nairobi Expressway, Adhere said.

Images and video released by the Colorado State Patrol show a semi-truck crushed under the collapsed bridge and more than a dozen derailed train cars that spilled coal across the highway. Two sets of train car wheels can be seen among the coal. BNSF, the train operator, said no injuries were reported to its crew. The railroad said it was working with authorities to investigate and clean up the site. State Patrol spokesman Gabriel Moltrer said the truck driver suffered fatal injuries. The Pueblo County Coroner's office has not yet released the driver's name. A stretch of the interstate, which runs north-south through Colorado via Denver, remained closed in both directions Monday. The section of the highway carries about 40,000 vehicles per day. This will be an extended closure, the Colorado Department of Transportation said in a bulletin for drivers. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the derailment, with a team expected to arrive at the scene Monday. Sarah Taylor Sulick, an NTSB spokeswoman, said the investigation also will examine the bridge and its maintenance. The bridge is owned by BNSF. While data on road bridges is released by federal authorities, inspection reports for bridges owned by railroads are not routinely released to the public. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday he talked to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) about the derailment and that officials from his department were on their way to the scene. BNSF has had 177 derailments this year, according to the latest Federal Railroad Administration data. Lawmakers have been weighing changes to rail safety laws after a February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which involved the release of hazardous chemicals. A Senate committee approved a bill in May, but it has not come up for a vote on the Senate floor.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The order from YOU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is a milestone moment in the federal case that accuses Trump of illegally conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Special counsel Jack Smith's team had raised alarm about a barrage of statements disparaging prosecutors, the judge and prospective witnesses. Those comments, prosecutors said, risked undermining public confidence in the court system and causing witnesses or people who might be picked as jurors for trial to feel harassed and intimidated. Chukan said there would be no restrictions statements criticizing the Justice Department generally or statements about Trump's belief that the case is politically motivated.

In seeking a gag order, Smith's team accused the 2024 GOP presidential front-runner of using online attacks to try to undermine the public's confidence in the justice system and taint the jury pool. Trump's lawyer John Lauro accused prosecutors of seeking to censor a political candidate in the middle of a campaign. But the judge shot back that Trump does not have a right to say and do exactly as he pleases. You keep talking about censorship like the defendant has unfettered First Amendment rights. He does not, Chutkan said. We are not talking about censorship here. We are talking restrictions to ensure there is a fair administration of justice on this case. Chutkan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, repeatedly warned Trump's lawyer to keep politics out of the courtroom, and she cut him off when he suggested the case was politically motivated. Prosecutor Molly Gaston on Monday had told the judge Trump's lawyers were arguing their client is above the law and not subject to the same rules as other defendants. Gaston said Trump knows that his posts motivate people to threaten others, and she argued those can not only pollute the jury pool but also can chill witnesses. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio We have no interest in stopping the defendant from running for office or defending his reputation, she said. Chutkan also read aloud statements Trump has made about her, deriding her as a radical Obama hack. Although she said she was less concerned about statements that Trump has made about her, she said his free speech does not extend to language that knowingly invites threats and harassment of people who are simply doing their jobs. The gag order proposal underscored the unprecedented complexities of prosecuting the GOP presidential primary front-runner, who has made the line of attack central to his campaign. And it presented a big test for Chutkan, who must balance Trump's First Amendment right to defend himself publicly with the need to protect the integrity of the case. It marked the beginning of what could be an extraordinary fight over what limits can be placed on the speech of a defendant who is also running for America's highest public office. Any gag order from Chutkan is likely be challenged on appeal and could ultimately end up before the YOU.S. Supreme Court, legal experts have said. Trump's campaign had seized on the proposal of a gag order in fundraising appeals, and Trump falsely characterized it as an attempt to prevent him from criticizing President Joe Biden. Trump's defense called the gag order request unconstitutional and a desperate effort at censorship. The Chutkan hearing came on the heels of a judge overseeing Trump's civil fraud trial in New York imposing a more limited gag order prohibiting personal attacks against court personnel following a social media post from Trump that maligned the judge's principal clerk. Monday was the first time Trump's lawyers had appeared before Chutkan since she denied Trump's request to recuse herself from the case, which alleges Trump illegally schemed to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The defense had claimed Chutkan's comments about Trump in other cases raised questions about whether she had prejudged his guilt. But Chutkan said her comments were mischaracterized and there was no need for her to step aside. Trump has frequently used social media to attack Chutkan, prosecutors, likely witnesses and others despite warnings from the judge that inflammatory comments could force her to move up the trial currently scheduled to begin in March. Prosecutors noted in a recent motion that Trump's incendiary rhetoric continued even after their initial gag order request. They cited critical comments about witnesses referenced in the indictment -- such as former Attorney General William Barr -- and a social media post suggesting that Mark Milley, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had committed treason and should be executed. Prosecutors said their proposal would not have prevented Trump from publicly declaring his innocence. In court papers, they wrote that Trump was demanding special treatment by claiming he should have free rein to publicly intimidate witnesses and disparage others involved in the case. In this case, Donald J. Trump is a criminal defendant like any other, Smith's team wrote. Richer reported from Boston.

The two officers had just arrived at work when they witnessed a group of individuals breaking into a car in the parking lot at Philadelphia International Airport. Upon intervening, a confrontation ensued, leading to the officers and one of the suspects being shot. Officer Richard Mendez, a 50-year-old who had served on the force for over two decades, tragically lost his life after being shot four times. Officer Raul Ortiz, a 20-year veteran, sustained a single gunshot wound to his arm but has since been released from the hospital. The suspects fled the scene in a stolen SUV, which was later seen at a hospital where it dropped off 18-year-old Jesus Herman Madera Duran. Duran, who had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to his chest, abdomen, and left arm, was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival at the hospital. Authorities are still investigating whether any other suspects were injured during the shooting or how many individuals were involved in firing weapons. Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford expressed the department's shock and sorrow, particularly as this incident occurred just a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. The investigation is ongoing, and police have released surveillance videos showing at least one suspect involved in the incident. Additionally, the vehicle used to transport Madera Duran to the hospital has been identified. In response to the tragedy, a substantial reward of at least 184,500 has been offered for information leading to an arrest. This includes contributions from local police unions, other law enforcement organizations, businesses, and concerned residents. The city has also offered a separate 20,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.

Jim Jordan becoming House speaker would help cement the far right's takeover of the Republican Party and trigger conflict with Democrats over the size and scope of government. A Jordan speakership would also come with political baggage heading into next year's election. The Ohio congressman has such a reputation as a political brawler that former House Speaker John Boehner once said he would never met someone who spent more time tearing things apart. Jordan is a favorite of former President Donald Trump. But Jordan's path to the speakership is by no means certain. Jordan will need support from nearly every House Republican in a chamber they narrowly control. WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised more than 71 million for his reelection in the three months ending Sept. 30, a strong indication that party donors remain united behind him going into a 2024 race that may feature a rematch with Donald Trump. Sunday's announcement follows the president's campaign and party saying they would raised slightly more, 72-plus million in the 10 weeks between the official announcement he was seeking reelection on April 25 and the end of the second quarter on June 30. The campaign also said Democrats have 91 million in cash on hand, the highest-ever total by a Democrat at this point in an election cycle.

The actors guild president told The Associated Press that she did not understand why negotiations collapsed but that these bargaining tactics will not weaken the actors guild's resolve.

The settlement also prohibits the federal government from separating any migrant families crossing the border for eight years, unless the parents are considered a danger to their children or the public or they have previously entered the country illegally more than twice. The deal, announced by the Justice Department, may end one of the darkest chapters in YOU.S. immigration policy, in which families crossing the YOU.S.-Mexico border illegally in 2017 and 2018 were systematically separated. Children younger than 18 were sent to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, while parents were prosecuted by YOU.S. attorneys in federal court. But the settlement could be derailed by Republicans in Congress if they challenge the court's mandate to appropriate money to reunify and provide services to separated families. YOU.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw of the Southern District of California is expected to approve the proposed settlement, but he may be asked to review objections. Those objections could come from parties such as America First Legal, a conservative legal group run by Stephen Miller, the former Trump adviser who was considered the architect of the family separation policy. The families also sought financial compensation from the YOU.S. government, but the Biden administration's Justice Department abruptly walked away from those negotiations two years ago when President Joe Biden was asked if families would be receiving 450,000 each and he said it was not going to happen. Individual families are still seeking damages in civil court, where the Biden administration has been fighting them. While no settlement can ever wipe away this tragic episode in our country's history, the settlement is a much-needed step forward to help the thousands of families that were so brutally separated under the Trump administration, said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead counsel representing the families in the case. The settlement will allow little children to finally see their parents after years of separation and permit suffering families to seek permanent status in the YOU.S. Critically, it will also prohibit such a cruel policy in the future. Whatever one thinks about border policy generally, there can be no disagreement that ripping babies and toddlers from their parents is morally repugnant. On a call with reporters about the settlement, a Department of Homeland Security official said family separation was a cruel and inhumane policy. That official added that that more than 3,000 separated families have been reunified and hundreds more remain separated. The agreement also covers more than 290 children, who are YOU.S. citizens separated from noncitizen parents at the border by the Trump administration, who were not previously included in the lawsuit.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un shake hands during their meeting on Sept. 13. Vladimir SmirnovSputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File TOKYO - Russian ships linked to military transport networks have collected cargo from North Korea and delivered it to an apparent Russian military port on multiple occasions over the past two months, according to new satellite images providing the clearest evidence yet that Pyongyang may be helping Moscow's war effort. The two ships had no record of running this route between North Korea and Russia until August, when high-level meetings between North Korean and Russian officials began, paving the way for Kim Jong Un to meet Vladimir Putin last month. YOU.S. intelligence assessments at the time suggested that Russia was looking to get North Korean weaponry to replenish its dwindling supplies for the war in Ukraine. White House officials said Friday this now appears to be happening and named one Russian vessel, alleging that North Korea has transported as many as 1,000 containers with equipment and munitions from North Korea to Russia in recent weeks. But new satellite images, analyzed by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and provided first to The Washington Post, suggest this operation is more regular, extensive and ongoing than the White House revealed. Not one but two ships have been plying the route between the northeastern North Korean port of Rajin and a secure port facility in Dunai, in Russia's Far East, making at least five round trips beginning mid-August through Saturday, according to the RUSI analysis. Although it is impossible to tell what is being transported, the new images show ships linked to the Russian military logistics network, which strongly suggests these commercial vessels are carrying military equipment, RUSI analysts and YOU.S. officials say. This will have a very serious effect on the trajectory of the war in Ukraine, said Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI. North Korea has the ability to manufacture a lot of ammunition, and it has significant stockpiles. North Korea makes two of the types of munitions that Russia has used heavily in the war - Soviet-era 122mm Grad rockets and 122mm howitzer artillery rounds - and desperately needs more of as its wages its grinding war of attrition against Ukraine. Around the time the shipments began, munition pits were rapidly expanded at an ammunition depot near the Ukrainian border, which YOU.S. officials identified as the ultimate destination for the shipments. YOU.S. officials and experts have said North Korea has Soviet-designed munitions and other conventional weapons, including artillery platforms and rocket launchers, that the Russians are seeking. The new satellite images show that two Russian-flagged cargo ships, the Angara and the Maria, began traveling between Rajin and Dunai in mid-August. They have made at least five trips since, moving hundreds of containers, according to the images. The latest delivery from North Korea to Russia took place on Saturday, when the Maria was spotted in Dunai offloading cargo, according to RUSI's analysis. Shortly before they began operating along this route, the two vessels went dark, turning off the signal of their automatic identification system, according to data from ship-tracking site Marine Traffic. This allows the Maria and Angara to hide their position as they transit between ports. Around the same time, there was a rapid expansion of munition pits at an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk, about 180 miles from the Ukrainian border, images show. These pits have been filled with munition boxes in recent weeks as rail cars arrived, offloading containers that were lined next to the pits. The color and size of those containers matched the shipments arriving at Dunai from Rajin, according to RUSI. YOU.S. officials alleged last Friday that these munition boxes originated from North Korea, and the characteristics of the ships appear to support YOU.S. allegations that North Korea has delivered weapons to Russia for the war using this route. The White House last week released satellite images of what it said were 300 shipping containers delivered by the cargo vessel from Rajin to Dunai by sea, and then transported by rail to an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk. This transfer was made between Sept. 7 and October 1, YOU.S. officials said. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire in 1953, the two Koreas have been developing huge amounts of conventional weapons in case war breaks out again on the peninsula. North Korea is believed to have a large stockpile of artillery shells and rockets that would be compatible with Soviet and Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. It also has production capacity to manufacture new weapons that would help Russia maintain its high ammunition burn rate as the Kremlin seeks to scale up domestic production. This is widely thought to have been the catalyst for Kim's trip to far-eastern Russia for a rare in-person summit with Putin last month, his first trip abroad since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Kim called his country's relations with Russia his top priority and pledged full support for Putin and his government amid their war in Ukraine. Analysts say in return for supporting the Kremlin, North Korea may be interested in advanced technologies from Russia for its weapons and nuclear program. During his trip, Kim toured a Russian fighter jet factory that is under Western sanctions, as well as a key Russian spaceport. Neither the Russian Embassy in the United States nor the North Korean mission to the United Nations responded to a request for comment sent Sunday. Analysis by RUSI found that the operation may have started at the end of August and appears to have involved a second vessel, Maria, which followed a similar path as the Angara, the ship identified by YOU.S. officials. The images show the two vessels making multiple trips between Dunai and Rajin, picking up and delivering cargo at each location. At the Rajin port, the two ships typically load and unload containers at different docks. In Dunai, the ships have unloaded their cargo while next to a military vessel. Kirby said Russia may have responded in kind by shipping weapons of its own to North Korea. He did not specify the types of arms that the United States believed were shipped. Russia's use of civilian ships to covertly carry out military activities has been well documented. Military analysts recently spotted signs that Russian merchant vessels are probably transporting suspected military equipment from Syria to Russia. The Angara is owned by M Leasing, which has been sanctioned by the United States, the United Kingdom and Ukraine for transportation of weapons and military equipment in the interests of the Russian government. It is managed by Marine Trans Shipping, another maritime shipping company sanctioned for transporting weapons for the Russian government. Registration documents for the Maria show a company called JSC Sovfracht is associated with the vessel, RUSI found. In 2019, the United States named Sovfracht as a company behind a sanctions evasion conspiracy to aid Russian forces operating in Syria in support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. - - - Joyce Sohyun Lee reported from Washington.

The Colorado Department of Transportation said it would be an extended closure as local law enforcement officials waited for federal investigators to arrive. The bridge was built in 1958 according to Colorado Department of Transportation records, department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. BNSF owns the bridge and is responsible for inspecting it, he said. It was unclear when the bridge collapsed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler said. A 60-year-old man driving a semi-truck caught in the wreckage was killed, according to Gabriel Moltrer, a spokesperson for Colorado State Patrol. Moltrer did not offer more details about the man's death, citing an ongoing investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. Until investigators are able to asses the scene, it is unknown what the timeline for the highway's reopening will be, said Perez. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov.

Dressed in an orange prison-issued jumpsuit, his hair disheveled, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba answered yes sir to the judge but otherwise sat quietly in a Will County courtroom where he was formally charged with three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery and two counts of committing a hate crime. Investigators said the deadly attack that resulted in the death of Wadea Al-Fayoume was linked to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East. In their petition requesting that Czuba be detained, prosecutors said that right before the attack, the landlord confronted the boy's mother, Hanaan Shahin, and told her he was angry at her for what was going on in Israel. Shahin stated she responded to him 'let us pray for peace', the petition said. Shahin stated Czuba gave her no chance to do anything... then attacked her with a knife. Czuba, the boy's mother told investigators, was an angry man. His wife, Mary, told investigators that Czuba listens to conservative talk radio on a regular basis and became obsessed with the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. Shahin also told police she had been texting Czuba's wife about her husband's hatred for Muslims. On October 11, Czuba said he wanted Shahin and her son move out of the home, Mary Czuba told investigators. Shahin told deputies that on that same day, Czuba confronted her about what was going on in the Middle East. Czuba's arraignment and detention came on the same day that hundreds of people were expected to say farewell to Wadea, who authorities said died Saturday after the landlord stabbed him 26 times. His 32-year-old mother was stabbed a dozen times while trying to protect her son and call for help, police said. She was still recovering at the hospital while mourners gathered for her son's funeral at the Mosque Foundation in suburban Bridgeview. Czuba was screaming you Muslims have to die when he barged into the ground floor apartment mother and son shared in suburban Plainfield, family friend Yousef Hannon told NBC News before the funeral, citing texts she sent to the boy's father. Hannon said Czuba also shouted, You are killing our kids in Israel. You Palestinians do not deserve to live. Shaheen did not have even one percent suspicion he would hurt the child because Czuba had been like a grandfather to Wadea and even built him a tree house, Hannon said. The child, when he saw Czuba, ran to him for a hug and instead was stabbed 26 times, Hannon said. Wadea was pronounced dead at the hospital, after which a forensic pathologist removed a military style knife with a seven-inch blade from his abdomen, the Will County sheriff's office said in a news release. The YOU.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, which is based in Chicago, opened a federal criminal hate crimes investigation into the killing of the little boy. The brutal assault was condemned earlier by President Joe Biden and sparked fears that ongoing war between Hamas and Israel could result in retribution attacks against Palestinian immigrants in the YOU.S. Hate has no place in America, Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement released Monday. We unequivocally condemn hate and Islamophobia and stand with the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities. Wadea's family came to the YOU.S. from the West Bank and settled in the Chicago suburbs about a dozen years ago to get away from the violence in the Palestinian territory, according to the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Reached by telephone, Czuba's brother, David, said the family was preparing a statement and declined to make any further comment. Czuba did not make any statements to detectives regarding his involvement in this heinous attack when sheriff's deputies responding to the unfolding tragedy found him with a laceration on his forehead sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence, the Will County sheriff's office said earlier. Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis, the sheriff's office said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations on the derailment and collapse. He said officials would be ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain them. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. A railroad bridge collapse along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana in June sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. That collapse remains under investigation and involved a steel truss bridge That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet (57-meter) long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet (4 meters) feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet (five meters), he said. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said just a few hours before Biden was set to take off for the trip that it would be rescheduled.

The move comes as fears mount of escalation as Israel stands poised for what government officials are saying will be the next phase of the war against Hamas with an all-out air, sea, and land invasion of Gaza. Royal Caribbean Group confirmed that it was working with the YOU.S. Its cruise ship, the Rhapsody of the Seas (78,878 gross tons) which had been idled in Cyprus, was dispatched to Haifa overnight. The cruise ship, which was built in 1997, had been operating cruises from Israel that were canceled last week after the war began. The embassy in Israel announced that embarkation would begin at 8:00 a.m. this morning local time advising American nationals who had the proper paperwork to arrive at the terminal by 8:00 a.m. and that boarding would be on a first-come basis. The embassy was only saying that space would be limited, but media reports said they hoped to load as many as 2,500 people aboard. The cruise ship, which is registered in the Bahamas, has approximately 1,000 passenger cabins and a normal maximum passenger capacity of just over 2,400 people along with 765 crew. It was unclear if everyone was being assigned a cabin or if the ship would take deck passengers for the trip, which was expected to last 10 to 12 hours. Israeli media were reporting the scene at the dock was chaotic today. Embassy personnel were trying to guide the process, but at times recommended people leave and return later in smaller groups. Each passenger was permitted just one suitcase of up to 50 lbs. and a small carry-on bag. No pets were being embarked on the ship. They were being told that food and Wi-Fi would be available onboard and the YOU.S. consular staff would be traveling to assist the people evacuating from Israel. The cruise ship departed Haifa shortly after 4:00 p.m. local time after about seven hours in Haifa and is returning to Cyprus. According to its AIS signal, it is sailing at about 10 knots and is due to reach Limassol at 8:00 a.m. local time tomorrow, October 17. The YOU.S. Embassy in Cyprus will provide buses from the ship to the two airports on Cyprus, but onward travel and accommodations is the individual's responsibility. The embassy in Israel was reporting that charter flights would be conducted out of Cyprus due to the limited availability of commercial service. On Sunday, the YOU.S. Embassy wrote in an advisory, We urge those wishing to leave to take advantage, of its travel arrangements which also included planned charter flights from Israel to nearby safe locations. With commercial flights remaining very limited out of Israel, the YOU.S. said it would be offering seats on a space-available basis on an unspecified number of charters. They advised the family members of YOU.S. government employees and some non-emergency personnel would also be authorized to depart. It is unclear if the YOU.S. has plans for any further emergency evacuations from Israel. All the major cruise lines last week suspended their port calls, as did most commercial airlines. It was reported that MSC Cruises chartered an Israeli-owned cruise ship, Crown Iris (40,000 gross tons), and on Sunday the cruise ship spent about 10 hours in Haifa disembarking Israelis that had been on an MSC cruise when the war broke out.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The 60-year-old driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon accident on Interstate 25, but authorities said Monday that he had died. No other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. Photos and videos posted by authorities showed a partially collapsed bridge over the interstate with the semi-truck caught beneath in the right lane. The images also show a pileup of train cars, train wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway. The highway -- the main north-south highway in Colorado -- remained closed Monday morning. The Colorado Department of Transportation said it would be an extended closure as local law enforcement officials waited for federal investigators to arrive. The bridge was built in 1958 according to Colorado Department of Transportation records, department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. BNSF owns the bridge and is responsible for inspecting it, he said. It was not immediately known whether the truck was caught beneath the collapsing bridge or if it somehow caused the collapse, Perez said. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing an ongoing investigation. Until investigators are able to assess the scene, it is unknown what the timeline for the highway's reopening will be, said Perez.

Rapidly drying tributaries to the mighty Amazon river have left boats stranded, cutting off food and water supplies to remote jungle villages, while high water temperatures are suspected of killing more than 100 endangered river dolphins. The port in Manaus, the region's most populous city located where the Negro river meets the Amazon river, recorded a water level of 13.59 meters (44.6 ft) on Monday, according to its website. That is the lowest level since records began in 1902, passing a previous all-time low set in 2010. After months without rain, Amazon rainforest villager Pedro Mendonca was relieved when a Brazilian NGO delivered supplies to his riverside community near Manaus late last week. We have gone three months without rain here in our community, said Mendonca, who lives in Santa Helena do Ingles, west of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state. It is much hotter than past droughts. Some areas of the Amazon have seen the lowest rain levels from July to September since 1980, according to the Brazilian government disaster alert center Cemaden. Brazil's Science Ministry blames the drought on this year's onset of the climate phenomenon El Nino, which is driving extreme weather patterns globally. In a statement earlier this month, the ministry said it expects the drought will last until at least December, when El Nino's effects are forecast to peak. The drought has affected 481,000 people as of Monday, according to the civil defense agency in the state of Amazonas, where Manaus is located. Late last week, workers from Brazilian NGO Fundacao Amazonia Sustentavel (FAS) fanned out across the parched region near Manaus to deliver food and other supplies to vulnerable village communities. The drought has threatened their access to food, drinking water and medicines, which are usually transported by river. Nelson Mendonca, a leader in Santa Helena do Ingles, said although some areas are still reachable by canoe, many boats have not been able to travel on the river to bring supplies, and goods are being transported by tractors or on foot. It is not very good for us, because we are practically isolated, he said. Luciana Valentin, who also lives in Santa Helena do Ingles, said she is concerned about the cleanliness of the local water supply after the drought reduced water levels. Our children are getting diarrhea, vomiting, and often having fever because of the water, she said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

There were few initial details about the incident, as well as a rocket that struck a neighborhood just northwest of the airport, killing a child. The Taliban initially described the two strikes as separate incidents, though information on both remained scarce and witnesses heard only one large blast Sunday in the Afghan capital. The airstrike came as the United States winds down a historic airlift that saw tens of thousands evacuated from Kabul's international airport, the scene of much of the chaos that engulfed the Afghan capital since the Taliban took over two weeks ago. After an Islamic State affiliate's suicide attack that killed over 180 people, the Taliban increased its security around the airfield as Britain ended its evacuation flights Saturday. YOU.S. military cargo planes continued their runs into the airport Sunday, ahead of a Tuesday deadline earlier set by President Joe Biden to withdraw all troops from America's longest war. However, Afghans remaining behind in the country worry about the Taliban reverting to their earlier oppressive rule -- something fueled by the recent shooting death of a folk singer in the country by the insurgents. Two American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers. YOU.S. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the American military's Central Command, called the drone strike an action taken in self-defense. He said authorities continued assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time. We are confident we successfully hit the target, Urban said. Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid earlier said in a message to journalists that the YOU.S. strike targeted a suicide bomber as he drove a vehicle loaded with explosives. Mujahid offered few other details. The strike was the second by America since the airport suicide bombing. On Saturday, a strike in Nangarhar province killed an Islamic State member believed to be involved in planning attacks against the United States in Kabul. The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group's more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority, including a 2020 assault on a maternity hospital in Kabul in which they killed women and infants. The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a YOU.S.-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 911 attacks, which al-Qaida orchestrated while being sheltered by the group. The rocket attack struck Kabul's Khuwja Bughra neighborhood, said Rashid, the Kabul police chief who goes by one name. Video obtained by The Associated Press in the aftermath of the attack showed smoke rising from building at the site around a kilometer (half a mile) from the airport. No group immediately claimed the attack, however militants have fired rockets in the past. Meanwhile, the family of a folk singer north of Kabul say the Taliban killed him under unclear circumstances in recent days. The shooting of Fawad Andarabi came in the Andarabi Valley for which he was named, an area of Baghlan province some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kabul. The valley had seen upheaval since the Taliban takeover, with some districts in the area coming under the control of militia fighters opposed to the Taliban rule. The Taliban say they have since retaken those areas, though neighboring Panjshir in the Hindu Kush mountains remains the only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces not under its control. The Taliban previously came out to Andarabi's home and searched it, even drinking tea with the musician, his son Jawad Andarabi told the AP. But something changed Friday. He was innocent, a singer who only was entertaining people, his son said. They shot him in the head on the farm. His son said he wanted justice and that a local Taliban council promised to punish his father's killer. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, told the AP that the insurgents would investigate the incident, but had no other details on the killing. Andarabi played the ghichak, a bowed lute, and sang traditional songs about his birthplace, his people and Afghanistan as a whole. A video online showed him at one performance, sitting on a rug with the mountains of home surrounding him as he sang. There is no country in the world like my homeland, a proud nation, he sang. Our beautiful valley, our great-grandparents' homeland. Karima Bennoune, the United Nations special rapporteur on cultural rights, wrote on Twitter that she had grave concern over Andarabi's killing. We call on governments to demand the Taliban respect the humanrights of artists, she wrote. Agnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, similarly decried the killing. There is mounting evidence that the Taliban of 2021 is the same as the intolerant, violent, repressive Taliban of 2001, she wrote on Twitter. 20 years later. Nothing has changed on that front. Also on Sunday, private banks across Afghanistan resumed their operations. However, they limited withdrawals to no more than the equivalent of 200 a day. While some complained of still being unable to access their money, government employees say they have not been paid over the last four months. The Afghani traded around 90.5 to 1, continuing its depreciation as billions of dollars in the country's reserves remain frozen overseas.

The acknowledgment by South Korea's Unification Ministry was the first official statement after the Biden administration and an open-source intelligence body both said in recent days that they had seen signs of the North Korean munitions shipment. North Korea has denied an arms trade with Russia several times, but relevant circumstances are emerging one by one, Unification Ministry spokesman Koo Byoung-sam said Monday. The true nature of North Korea, which has attempted to deceive the whole world, has been exposed. South Korea said the arms shipments violated longstanding YOU.N. Security Council sanctions levied on Pyongyang over its nuclear and conventional military build-up. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday it appears that Mr. Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on the deal in their summit in Vladivostok last month, with North Korea seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost Russia's military and nuclear program. The White House released images from over a three-week period last month showing over a thousand North Korean containers loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. One photograph shows a Russian-flagged vessel taking aboard some 300 shipping containers on September 7 and the same containers were subsequently photographed by satellite at the port of Dunay in the Russian Far East five days later. A train packed with containers was spotted at a Russian ammunition depot at Tikhoretsk near the Black Sea -- close to the scene of heavy fighting in Ukraine -- on October 1. The transfer comes as Russian forces are engaged in an offensive targeting the Ukrainian-held city of Avdiivka in the Donbas region, the biggest advance by Moscow's forces since Kiev unleashed its own broad-front counteroffensive in June. The timing of the suspected shipments suggests that the deliveries fueled -- or backfilled -- Russia's latest offensive in Ukraine. The Kremlin has struggled to keep its forces supplied in the face of international sanctions and a war that has lasted far longer than Mr. Putin anticipated. Russia has already turned to Iran for military drones to help support the campaign, and a senior Western nation officer told The Washington Times in June that Russian artillery, which had previously been firing shells at multiples to Ukrainian guns, were shooting at rough parity. An unnamed South Korean defense ministry official told reporters that the North Korean supplies were sizable. Considering the containers' capacity, it would be an amount equivalent to hundreds of thousands of shells, which are in most need by Russia, the official said. Separately, North Korean state media on Monday announced that Mr. Lavrov would travel to Pyongyang for two days of talks starting Wednesday. North Korea has major stockpiles of the Soviet-era munitions still used by Russian forces. Mr. Lavrov's visit follows one by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who met Mr. Kim in Pyongyang in July, setting the stage for the September 13 meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Kim. Defense analysts here say the shipment appeared to be clearly timed for the major Russian offensive action, after months in which Russian troops were largely holding defensive lines against a slow-moving Ukrainian advance in the south and east. The timing is a little short -- or it is a big coincidence, said Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean general. Mr. Chun added that, were he planning a major operation, he would want his ammunition dumps filled at least a month before -- but maybe for the Russians, it is a bit earlier. Even before the White House announcement, North Korea-focused website Beyond Parallel posted online satellite imagery taken on October 5, showing cargo trains loaded with containers at the North Korea-Russian border railway station of Tumangang. The hub, the website said, is busier than any time during the past five years. The dramatic increase in rail traffic likely indicates North Korea's supply of arms and munitions to Russia, the website's analysts wrote. However, the extensive use of tarps to cover the shipping cratescontainers and equipment makes it impossible to conclusively identify what is seen. Despite the North Korean arms, The Associated Press reported that Ukrainian officials said Monday they see signs the Russian offensive against Avdiivka is losing momentum. Ukrainian forces repelled 15 Russian attacks from four directions on the city over the previous 24 hours, the Ukrainian General Staff said, down from 60 sorties in the middle of last week. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank that has provided near-daily in-depth accounts of the fighting, reported Sunday that Russian forces continued offensive operations aimed at encircling Avdiivka ... but have yet to make further gains amid a likely decreasing tempo of Russian operations in the area.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

KKTV reported that 12 train cars came off the track Sunday afternoon when a rail bridge collapsed and landed on I-25, crushing a northbound 18-wheeler and killing its driver. The train, which was hauling coal according to Colorado State Patrol spokesman Brian Lyons, derailed just before 3:30 p.m. Sunday. No vehicles other than the 18-wheeler were reported hit. Local law enforcement moved quickly to establish alternate routes around the area, which KKTV said would be closed for the foreseeable future. Apparently, however, some drivers were ignoring the sheriff's specific instructions and seeking faster routes by trespassing, which the sheriff's office unsurprisingly discouraged in a second update. I-25 MP 107, north of Pueblo, is closed in both directions due to a bridge collapse and train derailment, according to the site. This will be an extended closure, possibly lasting through 10162023. Seek alternate routes. ... Expect long delays. The sheriff's office, in a Facebook post and several updates Sunday, also warned drivers to expect delays, saying that the detours would be in place for an indefinite amount of time. Personnel from Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and National Transportation Safety Board are en route to Pueblo, Lyons told KKTV. They will have personnel on scene by mid-morning Monday to start the overall joint investigation ... to determine exactly what caused this incident to occur. HAZMAT crews were also investigating any possible diesel leaks from the crushed semi and the possibility that a propane truck that had been reported to be in the area around the time of the crash could also have been involved. It is an extended time before that cleanup can begin, Lyons said, because they have to do their investigation and they have to make sure everything is in its position to look and make sure they can have that determination as they start that investigation. KKTV noted that the derailment was the second such incident in the state in less than a week. On October 9, a train carrying heavy military equipment derailed in Colorado Springs. There were no injuries in that incident, according to a statement from Union Pacific cited by KKTV. Union Pacific crews are responding to the incident, which is under investigation, a statement from the company said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

PALOS HEIGHTS, Illinois -- Hours after the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy who was allegedly killed at the hands of a landlord was buried, family and friends retreated to a quiet diner to look back fondly on a once promising life cut short. Wadea Al-Fayoume was remembered Monday evening as a happy child, full of life and spunk, who had grown close to the neighbor and landlord who now stands accused of attacking him and his mother in a hate crime. Friends and family gathered for a dinner at Al Basha Cuisine in Palos Heights, Illinois less than two hours after Wadea was laid to rest. It was in this small restaurant where those who knew Wadea shared details about the boy's short-lived life. He did not have any hate or anger and he was always on a natural high, Mohamed Aly, 41, a close friend of the family who first met the boy on the day he was born, told NBC News during the dinner. More than 100 people gathered to celebrate the child's life over mansaf, a rice and lamb dish known in Palestinian culture. Wadea died Saturday after being stabbed 26 times at his Plainfield home. The Will County Sheriff's Office arrested and charged landlord Joseph Czuba, 71, alleging he targeted and stabbed Wadea and his mother because they were Muslim. Czuba's wife told investigators that Czuba had become obsessed with the war between Hamas and Israel. Wadea's mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, was stabbed more than a dozen times during the encounter, but is expected to survive. Those at the dinner in Palos Heights said the mother and son lived along the upper level of a townhouse, while the landlord resided in the basement. Aly said that in ways, Czuba, who was known to have several signs in his yard supporting former President Donald Trump, adopted the boy as a grandson, buying him a swing, trampoline, toys and gifts. He said Wadea's father, Odey Al-Fayoume, had been wary of them living in Czuba's house because he was a Trump supporter, but they stayed. Shahin told investigators that Czuba was an angry man. In a petition requesting that Czuba be detained, prosecutors said that right before the attack, the landlord confronted Shahin and told her he was angry at her for what was going on in Israel. Shahin stated Czuba gave her no chance to do anything ... then attacked her with a knife. The sheriff's office said Shahin ran into the bathroom and fought off her attacker as she called for help. Following the attack, Shahin asked her son if he was ok. Wadea looked up at his mother and said, I am fine, mama, his final words before passing away, Aly said. Shahin came to the YOU.S. 12 years ago from the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. Wadea's father came to the YOU.S. nine years ago, and Wadea was born in the YOU.S. CAIR executive director Ahmed Rehab said the boy's father told him that they came to the YOU.S. in part to escape violence. He said, 'Part of the reason we came here was to escape the settler violence in which situations like this could occur with impunity and it chased us all the way to the United States,' Rehab said Sunday. As Aly spoke, Odey Al-Fayoume sat at the head of the next table in the middle of the room hugging loved ones and embracing others. Neighbor Abdelbaset Emar, 53, said Wadea befriended his son and together they watched cartoons to help learn English. He would come over all the time, Emar said as he left the dinner. He added that both children played with action figures and often competed in football. Aly thinks back to the day Wadea was brought home from the the hospital after he was born. I saw another angel come into earth. I saw a baby who could fit in the palm of my hand, Aly said. But life did not come without early troubles. Friends said that by age 3, the boy started showing signs of special needs and was later diagnosed with ADHD. Family friend Yousef Hannon, 59, paid for the dinner. When a tragedy like this happens, I have to act, he said. This hate crime affects every Muslim, every Arabic, every Palestinian. This affects me.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Episode transcript Note: The following transcript was created by Headliner and may contain misspellings and other inaccuracies as it was generated automatically: Sean Sublette: Hello once again, everybody. I am, meteorologist Sean Sublette, and welcome to Across the Sky, our national Lee Enterprises weather podcast. Lee Enterprises has print and digital operations in more than 70 locations across the country, including in my home base in Richmond, Virginia. I am joined by my colleagues from across the sky, Matt Holiner in Chicago, and Joe Martucci at the Jersey Shore. Kirsten Lang is out this week. Our very special guest this week is Dr. Michael Mann, director of the University of Pennsylvania Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media, and the Presidential Distinguished Professor of Earth and Environmental Science. His latest book came out a couple of weeks ago called Our Fragile Moment. It goes through Earth's climate history to illustrate how we know what the current warming climate is without precedent in Earth's history. There is so much good stuff in this book. I could go on and on, but I really like the way he goes into paleo climate and helping us understand why we are at this moment in time and why he calls it Our Fragile Moment. And as a quick aside, in the book, he kind of alludes to, the police, the band The Police, and the, extinction of the dinosaurs and walking in your footsteps. So those of us of a certain age who remember that a good part of, you know, sting was the lead man of the police, and, Fragile was another song that Sting wrote. So this all kind of ties back into me. Here I am showing my age. but, guys, this is such a great conversation. What did you kind of take out of this? Joe Martucci: I think, you know, and just take a step back. I mean, Mike Mann is, I would say, one of the people who really put climate science on the map to the general public. So this is really a big interview that we have here. And, when you are listening, sometimes we are getting into the weeds, sometimes it is big philosophical questions. In fact, at the end, we talk about his thoughts on where our position as the human race is in the universe just by writing this book. So, it was a nice interview, and good to be with, Mike here. Matt Holiner: Yes, there are few people that are a bigger expert on climate change than Mike Mann. And so, yeah, we are honored to have him on the podcast. And what I like is how he talks about paleo climate, which is something that is starting to get a little bit of buzz now. I think everybody's accepted that, okay, the climate is changing now, but has not it changed in the past? And he does dive into that. Yes, it has changed, but what he points out is the change that we are undergoing right now is unique, and he. Joe Martucci: Points out why that is. Matt Holiner: And I really liked his discussion of that. Sean Sublette: Yeah, there is so much good stuff. So let us get right to it and start up with our interview with Dr. Michael Mann. Mike Mann, it is so good to have you on the across the sky podcast. Dr. Michael Mann writes a new book about climate change called 'Our Fragile Moment' Sean Sublette: I want to jump right into this on this book, Our Fragile Moment. This is the 6th book. What I loved about this one is that it goes a lot deeper into understanding paleo climatology. For us real science geeks out there, it really gets into depth about how we know how we got to this fragile moment. So I wanted to start on the big picture. What motivated you to write this book now? Dr. Michael Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Sean. It is great to be with all of you. All three of you know, it is interesting, this is sort of where I got my start as, a climate scientist, Paleo Climate, the hockey stick curve that my co authors and I published. it is hard to believe now, but it is, two and a half decades ago, that graph became sort of this iconic symbol, in the climate change debate. And that is really how I sort of entered the fray. And so now, two and a half decades later, I decided, well, let us do a deeper dive, because the hockey stick only went back a thousand years. That is really shallow time, as we say in Paleo climate. We have got four plus billion years of Earth history to look at and let us see what we can learn from it. And so it is sort of a return to my roots, in a sense. I had not really written a book about paleo climate, even though it is where I started as a scientist. And there is another sort of driving force here as well, which, relates to my last book, The New Climate War, which is about sort of the challenges we face now as climate denial becomes almost untenable, because we can all sort of see the impacts of climate change playing out. Dr. Michael Mann: But there are other tactics that bad actors are using to sort of delay the transition off fossil fuels. and one of them, ironically, is doom mongering. If they can convince us that it is too late to do anything about the problem, then why bother? And so I was seeing Paleo Climate, something that I hold dear. I was seeing paleo climate science. Weaponized. Now in the same way that climate deniers used to weaponize misinformation. I was seeing climate doomers weaponizing misinformation about paleo climate to convince us it is too late, that we are experiencing runaway warming. We are going to it is yet, another mass, extinction that we have set off that is unstoppable and we will all be gone in less than ten years. There were players out there, serious protagonists who have pretty large followings, who have been spreading that sort of misinformation. So I decided, let us reclaim paleo climate. Let us look at what the science actually says. And that was the purpose of the book initially, was to address some of those misconceptions that have been used to feed climate doomism. But in the process, I realized, well, no, there is a whole lot more to talk about. there are all sorts of lessons in 4 billion plus years of Earth history. Let us see what we can learn from it for sure. Sean Sublette: Before I turn it over to the other guys for questions, I want to talk a little bit more about that doomism concept. It is important to walk a line between urgency and agency, as you like to talk about, but get away from doomism. I would like to point out I was actually talking to a Rotary Club earlier today, that there has been progress. Right. clearly there needs to be more, but I like to point out we are starting to phase out coal globally. So there are things going how do you walk that line in terms of this is important, we need to stay on it, showing that there is progress and not succumbing to doomism for folks who are kind of depressed about it. Dr. Michael Mann: Yeah, no, absolutely. And there is sort of two pieces to it. First of all, there is just the science. Like, does the science say that we have triggered unstoppable warming and nothing we do to reduce carbon emissions is going to make a difference? No, it does not. And I wanted to make that very clear. And no, the paleo climate record does not support that. the best available science, in fact, tells us now that the planet stops warming up when we stop adding carbon pollution to the atmosphere. So there is this direct and immediate impact, on the climate of our efforts to act here. There is another piece to it, though, which is sort of there is another sort of component to doismism, which is like, we are not going to get our act together. And you could argue that remains to be seen, that is at least Arguable, the science does not support runaway warming. It does not support that sort of side of doomism. But will we garner the will to tackle this problem? Only the, future will tell. But it is interesting because you mentioned Rotary Club. There are lots of reasons for optimism. Lots of reasons. Things that we can look at, where we can say we are making real progress, rotarians have really taken a leadership role on this issue. I have spoken to some Rotary Clubs, groups in the past, and the Youth Climate movement, right. I mean, just, there is all of this energy. I see. know I teach at the University Of Pennsylvania. Climate is probably the number one issue to these students today, to these gen zers. Now, some of them fall victim to climate anxiety and climate doomism. So it is really important for them to understand the agency part of that urgency and agency duality. But yeah, the science certainly does not support the notion that we cannot do something about the climate crisis. And the paleo climate record certainly does not support that either. Joe Martucci: Hey, this is Joe and just want to thank you so much for coming on again. We really appreciate it. And best of luck to you and your, book here, Our Fragile Moment. More journalists are reporting on extreme weather events linked to climate change Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio Joe Martucci: My question does partially relate to what you said about gen zers. And some people do have climate anxiety. And if you are young, you are impressionable you are getting content from a variety of different sources, right? More than ever before, when we talk about extreme weather events and parlaying this into climate change. Right. I feel like in the past five years, maybe three years, we have seen a lot of this recently. And I think, personally, from my perspective, it is good. It is always a good teaching moment to talk about the facts and to forecast the climate science. How do you feel, though, about journalists reporting on this, as opposed to meteorologists who are experts in their field? There is many great journalists all across the country. We know that. But just like I do not know everything about maybe astronomy, right. Journals may not be completely in sync with what is happening with some of these events. Dr. Michael Mann: I do not know if you could kind. Joe Martucci: Of give us where you fall on this and how you would like to see these extreme weather events being parlayed into coverage as we go forward. Dr. Michael Mann: Thanks, Joe. It is a great question. And, you were talking about young folks, and, I used to think of myself as a young person, and then today I realized that David Lee Roth is 69 years old. I finally forced to accept the fact that I am now old. But you are right, there is this, energy and passion, among young folks. And another part of what is going on is we are seeing the impacts of climate change now play out in a profound way in the form of these extreme weather events. And there is always sort of this delicate balance in the way we cover those events. You will often hear people say, well, you can never blame any one, weather event, on climate change. and the thinking there has evolved quite a bit. We have detection and attribution. We can characterize how likely an event was to occur in the absence of climate change and how likely it was to occur. When we consider climate change and when we see that there is a huge increase when an event is a thousand year event without climate change, and it is suddenly a ten year event when we include climate change, then we can say, hey, the fact that we saw this is probably because we have warmed up the planet and we have made these sorts of events, these extreme heat waves, heat domes that we have been reading about, wildfires floods, superstorms. So there is this scientific machinery now that allows us to sort of characterize the impact that climate change is having on these events. But you are right. When you have trained meteorologists and climate experts who are familiar with that science, they are able to sort of frame it that way. When you have just sort of say, political journalists, journalists from other fields covering, the science, it is a quandary. It is very complicated because they are hearing conflicting things. They are hearing this. You can never blame any one event on climate change, but now they know that there is a way to try to characterize the impact that climate change is having. So I think there is some confusion among in the journalistic community right now. you also sometimes see it overplayed, right, where, like, every extreme event was caused by climate change. We cannot say that it is like a loading of the dice. Sixes are going to come up anyways. The fact that they are coming up so often is because we have loaded those dice, by the warming of the planet. So it is a complicated topic, and it is difficult to even trained climate and meteorology, specialists, even for us, it can be sort of challenging to explain the science and how we are able to quantify the impact climate change is having on these events. And that means that it often gets very confused in the public discourse. And at the same time, I would say that we are seeing the signal of climate change now emerge from the noise in the form of these extreme weather events. And it is a lost opportunity for certain if we do not explain that to the public. And so I personally think that there has been sort of a shift towards journalists in general, recognizing that there is a relationship and mentioning that when they talk about these events, not as often as we might like them to do, but we do see much more of that now. Climate change is part of the conversation here. And that is a real game changer, because that is where the rubber hits the road. When people realize, oh, man, it is these devastating fires. I have a friend who lost a house, or I have people, I know who got flooded, by that storm. When people start to know people who have been impacted or who have been impacted themselves, when people have their own climate story to tell, it really changes the whole conversation. And I think we are seeing that shift. Matt Holiner: Hey, Mike, it is Matt, and I think you are right about the climate change just becoming a term that everyone is familiar with now. But I think the term that people are not as familiar with that. Matt Holiner: You mentioned your book is Paleo climate. So when you are talking about paleo climate, how far back are you looking and what are you looking at to determine what the climate was thousands or millions of years ago? Dr. Michael Mann: So it is a matter of perspective, right? If you ask my daughter what is paleo climate LBO is like, those winters when you were growing up, that is paleo climate, to me, those 1970s winters. so it is always a matter of perspective. One person's paleo climate is another person's sort of recent, climate history. I focused a lot of my early work on the last thousand years where we could pull together all sorts of types of information to try to reconstruct in some detail how the climate had changed. but there are ways to go much further back. There are sediment cores. We can look at ancient, oxygen isotopes and reconstruct what ocean temperatures were and what, sea, levels were. so there is all of this wealth of information. And so what paleo climate really means, technically, it is anything that predates the historical era of the last couple of centuries where we actually have thermometer measurements or rain gauges measurements or what have you. Anything farther back than that, where we have to turn to indirect measures of climate like tree rings or corals or ice that becomes paleo climate. And so 1000 years that is paleoclimate. But a million years is paleoclimate and a billion years is paleoclimate. And the stories are so different on these different timescales. And the puzzles are all different. And each of these intervals, there are all of these events in Earth's climate history that I talk about in the book, and we can learn something from each of them. Snowball Earth. Yes, the Earth was once entirely covered in ice and unpacking. That tells us a lot about the dynamics of the climate system. the faint early sun. The great Carl Sagan recognized that the Earth should have been frozen 4 billion years ago, when life first emerged in the oceans. And we know it was not because there was liquid water, there was life. And he realized because the sun was only about 70 as bright back then, the Earth should have been frozen, but it was not. What, what is the explanation? How come there was an even stronger greenhouse effect? And it turns out that, gets us into sort of the Gaia hypothesis because there is this remarkable story where as the sun gradually gets brighter and the Earth should have got hotter and hotter, but it did not because the greenhouse effect got weaker over time. And in just such a way that the planet's climate, with some exceptions, like snowball Earth, stayed within habitable bounds, within bounds, that are habitable for life. Why is that? that is a really interesting puzzle. And it turns out life itself plays a role in stabilizing the climate, the global carbon cycle, the oxygenation of the atmosphere. There are all of these things that life itself did to change the composition of our atmosphere and to change the dynamics of the planet. And amazingly, life works in such a way as to help keep the climate, Earth's climate, habitable for life. And so that is an interesting puzzle. There is a lot to learn from that as well. And that is a good thing, right? There are stabilizing factors within the climate system that helps us. There is a certain amount of resilience. And that is one of the arguments against doomism that we are getting some help from the behavior of Earth's climate. There is a m safety margin. There is a margin, where we can perturb the climate, and it will stay within habitable bounds. The problem and what makes this such a fragile moment is we are now sort of at the edge of that envelope of stability. And if we continue with business as usual, we continue to pollute the atmosphere with carbon pollution, we will leave that moment behind. We, will depart from the sort of climate upon which all of this societal infrastructure was built to support now a global population of more than 8 billion people. And that is the real threat today. Sean Sublette: All right, so we are going to take a quick break. We will come back with a couple more key questions with Michael Mann on the across the sky podcast. Stay with us. Michael Mann talks about the chemistry that helps us reconstruct past climate Sean Sublette: And we are back with Dr. Michael Mann on the across the sky podcast. The new book is our fragile moment. It is a very deep dive, as they say, into paleo climatology, and why this particular moment in time is so crucial in the climate going forward. Mike, your expertise, obviously, is in paleo climates and all these things that we use geologically to reconstruct climate. A lot of us are familiar with the ice cores. also, these oxygen isotopes, those for the weather folks, are not quite as complicated. But, what I would like to talk about a little bit, explain some of the chemistry that is involved, that help us tell us what the climate was like. When we look at ocean sediment cores, these are things that are not classic atmospheric proxies, right? These are much more in the rocks, geological proxies, those stalagmites, stalactites, those kinds of things. Can you talk about what are we doing with these things in terms of chemistry that tell us what we need to know? Dr. Michael Mann: Yeah, so it is amazing. There are these paleothermometers, we sometimes, call them, and you think about ice, right? Ice is frozen water. That is h 20. And so there is an O in there. There is oxygen, atoms, in that ice. And it turns out that the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of oxygen there are two main stable isotopes of oxygen oxygen 16 and oxygen 18. And the ratio, of them is a function of, the temperature. And when you form precipitation, when you condense water vapor into a droplet, there is what we call fractionation, where the heavy and the light isotopes behave differently during that process. That is true for evaporation, it is true for condensation. And so if you think about what is going on an ice core, you are drilling down in the ice, and that ice got there because it snowed at some point. And that snow was condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. And that water vapor originally came from the evaporation from the ocean surface. And so at each stage, we have what is called a fractionation, where you are getting some sort of separation between the behavior of oxygen 16 and oxygen 18. The bottom line is, because of that, we can say things about ancient sea level from oxygen isotopes in sediment cores. We can say something about temperature from oxygen isotopes in sediment cores. We can say something about temperature from ice in ice cores on land. And it is not just oxygen. We can look at carbon isotopes because there is carbon twelve and carbon 13, two different stable isotopes of carbon. And that allows us, for example, to figure out, what happened with carbon dioxide, and what happened with ocean acidification, how much CO2 there was, dissolved in the ocean. In fact, if you really want to get into it, we can estimate the PH of the ocean from other isotopes, boron isotopes. And I am not going to get into the chemistry of that. But the bottom line is there are all of these amazing we call them proxy data. It is almost like nature provided us a way to sort of solve this puzzle of what happened in distant past. Almost like we were given, clues. It is like, well, I am going to give you these isotopes, and if you are smart, and if you figure out the chemistry and the physics, you will be able to figure out what happened to sea level, what happened to ocean temperatures, what happened to the amount of ice, what happened to the acidity of the ocean. All of these things that are very relevant to how carbon pollution is impacting our environment today. Matt Holiner: And Mike, I think we have reached a point now where everybody acknowledges that the climate is changing. It took us a long time to get here, but I think we have reached that point. But what people are pointing out now is that, as you are talking about with paleo climate, the Earth's climate has changed many times over the years, warming and cooling. So what makes the climate change that we are experiencing now unique compared to the past? Dr. Michael Mann: Yeah, it is a great question, because we can certainly find times in the distant past when carbon dioxide levels, greenhouse gas levels, carbon dioxide being the main sort of greenhouse, gas that varies over time. They were higher than they are today, and global temperatures were warmer than they are today. During the Early Cretaceous Period, dinosaurs were wandering the polar regions of the planet. There was no ice on, the face of the Earth. We have seen Earth go from ice covered to ice free. So we know there are times when it is been much colder than today. And there are times when it is been considerably warmer than today. So then the question is, all right, well, then what makes climate change such a problem? Because even if we warm the planet, with carbon pollution, we are not going to get up to those Early Cretaceous levels. Well, actually, if we tried really hard, we could. If we extracted every bit of fossil fuels we could find, we could do that. Why? Because all of that carbon that was in the atmosphere slowly got deposited beneath the surface of the Earth in what we today call fossil fuels, ancient carbon, organic carbon that got buried in soils or shells that fell to the bottom of the ocean. Carbon that was in the atmosphere, got buried beneath the surface of the planet and came down from those very high early Cretaceous levels, over 100 million years. Due to those natural processes, carbon dioxide levels came down. Well, what we are doing now is we are taking all that carbon that got buried over 100 million years beneath the surface and we are putting it back into the atmosphere, but we are doing it a million times faster. We are taking carbon that was buried over 100 million years and we are putting it back up in the atmosphere over 100 years. And so I sometimes say if I was going to write a slogan for this, it would be, it is the rate, stupid. We all remember, it is the economy, stupid. I think we are old enough some of us are old enough to remember that was sort of a political sort of logo. Well, it is the rate, stupid. Which is to say it is not so much how warm the planet is or, what the CO2 levels are. It is what climate are you adapted to and how rapidly are you moving away from that climate. Because we have developed this massive societal infrastructure over a 6000 year period. Civilization, I talk about sort of the origins of civilization in Mesopotamia, 6000 years was the first true civilization. And it turns out global temperatures were remarkably stable for six, seven, 8000 years during which we developed all of this infrastructure that supports eight plus billion people. And we are dependent on the stability of that climate and its ability to continue to support that infrastructure which we have created. And if we are rapidly changing the climate and moving out of that window of variability during which we created civilization, that is a real threat. If the warming exceeds our adaptive capacity and it exceeds the adaptive capacity of other living things, life has learned to adapt to, climate changes that take place over tens of millions of years. That is pretty easy. Adapting to climate changes of similar magnitude that take place over tens of years, that is much more difficult. And again, what makes it so fragile, such a fragile moment for us is that we have leveraged the number of people who can live on this planet, what we call the carrying capacity of the planet. We have probably leveraged it by a factor of ten. Through our technology, through our infrastructure. We can support eight plus billion people because we have all of this infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure, engineering. But it is fragile, right? Because if the planet warms dramatically and that infrastructure no longer remains viable, then we can no longer support that elevated carrying capacity. Then we revert to the natural carrying capacity of the planet, which is maybe a billion people. And you think about that. The planet without our infrastructure, without our technology, probably cannot support more than a billion people. We have got more than 8 billion people. That is why we cannot afford to destabilize the infrastructure that supports human civilization today. And that is what dramatic warming, that is what unmitigated climate change will do. How does studying Paleo climatology make you see our place in the universe? Joe Martucci: John said, I had the last question here, so I will wrap up with this. how does studying Paleo climatology and maybe even writing this book make you see our space or our race as humans in this universe? Because a lot of what you are talking about, you said Fragile Rights, the name of the book. How do you see our place in the universe, given what you have studied over the decade? Dr. Michael Mann: Thanks. It is a great question. and it is something I get into a little bit. Have some fun. At one point, we do some thought experiments. Some thought experiments, like, what if in one of the chapters, which is on, an episode of rapid warming, and by rapid warming, we mean, like, over 10,000 or 20,000 years rapid on geological timescales. Nothing like what we are doing today. But there was this period of relatively rapid warming, about 56 million years ago. We call it the PETM. Stands for the Paleocene eocene thermal maximum. It just rolls right off the tongue. And it was this period during which there was a massive injection of carbon dioxide into the system. Obviously, there were not SUVs, and there were not coal fired power plants. This was a natural input of volcanism through unusually intense volcanic eruptions, centered in Iceland, that tapped into a very carbon rich reservoir and put a very large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere over a relatively short period of time. And so it turns out that you can ask the question, can we rule out the possibility that there was an intelligent civilization back then that went on this massive fossil fuel burning spree and basically extinguished themselves? And my good friend Gavin Schmidt, who is the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has written a paper and has written some popular, essays about this idea because of the Silurian hypothesis. and it is basically imagine lizard people who existed 56 million. How can we rule out that that is what happened? And I grew up watching the land of the lost. And, Gavin, around the same time he was in Britain, and I think it was Dr who had a similar that is where the Silurian there were, like, these reptile beings, that basically destroyed their environment. And so it is a really interesting question. Can we rule that out? And in the process of trying to rule that out, it actually raises some really interesting questions about, what are the conditions for life? Do intelligent civilizations extinguish themselves naturally? this is sometimes called the Fermi paradox. it was something that Carl Sagan thought about if the universe is teeming. With life? How come we are not hearing from them? How come we are not getting radio signals? And it turns out you can look at all of the different how many planetary systems are there in the universe? You can sort of try to do the math and figure out how many intelligent civilizations you might expect there to be in the universe based on various assumptions. And it turns out the defining problem, all the uncertainty comes down to when intelligent civilizations emerge, how long do they persist for? Do they extinguish themselves? And that would be one explanation of Fermi's paradox. Obviously, it is very personal to us. We do not want to think that, we are on our own way to self caused extinction. So there is some deep questions there. When you look at Paleo Climate and you look at some of these past episodes, you can start to ask some larger questions that tap into these deeper philosophical questions about our place in the universe. is there life elsewhere in the universe? The thinking that you go through turns out to be very relevant to the thinking that you need to go through for, Know. And the punchline is, Adam. I am going to draw a blank on his, so, he is a well known astrophysicist, and writes about the search for extraterrestrial life. Adam and I am drawing a blank on his last name, which is very embarrassing. I am, sure he will watch this and be very upset at me. but, he actually came to Gavin because he was interested in the search for extraterrestrial life and asking some questions about climate change and climate change on other planets. and could that explain why we are not hearing from other civilizations? Because they because climate change and they extinguish themselves. And, Adam Frank is his name, and he is a well known sort of, science communicator, astrophysics search for extraterrestrial, sort of continuing the legacy of Carl Sagan and the Planetary Society and the sorts of questions that they were asking. So he came to Gavin, who is a climate modeler, and know, I want to work on, know, figuring out if climate change could have been what caused these other potential civilizations elsewhere in the universe to extinguish themselves. And then Gavin says, how do we know that that did not happen on Earth? And they go through this amazing sort of thought experiment, and it turns out it is hard at first blush to rule out that that is what happened. For example, the PETM. It takes quite a bit of work to convince yourself that it could not have been ancient lizard people that burned, fossil fuels. and so, yeah, so there is a lot you can learn from what are seemingly silly thought experiments that actually start to get at some pretty deep questions about us and our place in the universe. Sean Sublette: We know not all questions are silly. What plate tectonics has only been around for about 100 years or so. And everybody kind of thought, well, that was silly at the time. Dr. Michael Mann: Mike, we are going to stickers stop plate tectonics bumper stickers. Sean Sublette: Yeah, we are going to let you go. But, again, the book is our fragile moment. Social media is a mess nowadays, but where is the best place people can find you digitally and online? Dr. Michael Mann: Well, they can still find me on, what are we calling it this day? X. that is what it is called this week. But, I have sort of diversified. You can find me pretty much on all of the major social media platforms now. I am still on Twitter. X, and, Instagram and mastodon and Blue, sky, and I am forgetting threads. It is like, now we have got to be so diversified because we are no longer confident we can rely on the one that we were all relying on for so long. But, yeah, I am out there and people can find me at WW Michaelman Net. So, yeah, it was great talking with you guys and I, hope to do so again. Sean Sublette: Mike, appreciate it so much. Take care. travel safely. Good luck promoting the book. and it is great. I mean, I have read it. It is just wonderful. And also, I will say this publicly. Thanks for the little shout out at the back, my friend. Dr. Michael Mann: Thank you, my friend. It was great talking with you guys. Sean Sublette: Those are some very deep answers, guys. where is our place in the universe and this concept of lizard people from 50 OD million years ago. and the things you will go down the road you will go down when you start doing these thought experiments. But for me, the importance here, I think what Mike said is the pace of the warming is without precedent. What we are doing is happening so fast, it is going to be difficult to adapt. Some things are going to adapt more easily than others. And that is why this moment in time is so particular. Yeah, it is been warmer in the past, but our civilization, which is increasingly global over these last 2000, 3000 years in particular, last couple of hundred years, where the population has just blossomed, really kind of dependent on the climate that we have out there now. Guys, what do you think? Joe, what did you kind of take away from? Joe Martucci: Well, you know, anytime we talk about our place in the really, I do not know, just really focused on the topic because it does make you think about in some ways, how small we are relative to everything. And not just even planet Earth and the spec of the universe, but also human life in the span of the Earth's long, long history. And like he also said a few minutes before that question, it is the rate of change of the warming that is unique. I say this a lot of times when I do public talks. I said, listen, yeah, we have been warmer than we have been before, we have been colder than we have been before. But barring like an asteroid or some cataclysmic event, this is the only time we are really changing at such a rate. and there is facts and forecasts, and then there is what to do or not to do about it. And that is where your beliefs come in. But there is no denying that the rate of change, a lot of this is significant and something we have not seen really in the scope of human history. And beyond that, the Earth's history, again, minus the early millions, billion, two or four years, when the Earth was really trying to just get itself together, for lack of a better word. And in some of these asteroid or supervolcano events, it happened as well. Matt Holiner: I would say this was a humbling conversation, because also at the end, when he was talking about why have not we encountered other intelligent life? And then the comment that stood out to me is like, maybe it has existed, but because of their actions, resulted in their own extinction, and are we headed down that path? And is that why we have not encountered intelligent life? And then, the other comment that he made is when he was talking about carrying capacity, and now the Earth has a population of 8 billion. But you take out our technology, and what we could see if we continue on this path, if the climate continues. To the rate the change that it is. Matt Holiner: Experiencing now, that carrying capacity could drop to a billion. And then you think, you think about going from a population of 8 billion people to 1 billion, 7 billion people disappearing. That makes the hair stand your, arms and to think about could we result in our own extinction by our actions? And when you hear that, you want to say, let us not make that mistake, let us do something about this. Because again, the other comment was it is the rate stupid? And he talks about, yes, climate has changed in the past. And that is what some people keep coming out. It is like, well, what is the big deal if the climate has changed the past? We are just going through another cycle, but it is never changed at this pace and. Joe Martucci: We cannot keep up. Matt Holiner: He also talked about the planet has taken care of itself. When the sun became stronger, the greenhouse effect decreased. And so there has been that the Earth has all these protections in place to kind of keep the climate in balance. But we are breaking that. We are breaking these natural protections. That is why he calls it our fragile moment. Because if we continue at this pace, the Earth is not going to be able to heal itself. And so we have to take action to make sure we do not lose 7 billion people. So, again, we do not want to talk about the doomism. So it is a fine balance, though, because we absolutely have to take action, but know that we can take action. This is not hopeless. We still have time to fix this. Problem, so let us get on it. Sean Sublette: Yeah, as he says, there is urgency, but there is also agency. So I think that that is the quote that I like from him, most of all. So as we look to some other episodes coming down the pike, a little bit less heady. coming up next week, we have got Paul James of HGTV. We are going to look at the science of changing leaves. We are thick into, the fall right now, the leaves changing from north to south across the country, and we are also working in the background to bring you a broader winter forecast. We are still turning a couple of knobs on that, but we are working on that. I will be talking to Neil degrasse Tyson in a few weeks. We will bring that to the podcast. also I have talked to a couple of colleagues, the fifth national climate assessments coming out, and we are going to say, well, what does that mean and why should we care? We will answer those questions. we have got one more, Joe. you have got somebody coming in from Ohio State, right? Joe Martucci: Yeah, we do. That is coming up in a couple of weeks. That is for your, November 6 episode. We are speaking with Dr. Lawrence Sutherland, and it is tips prepare older loved ones in case of natural disasters or extreme weather. I have covered this topic a, number of times for the press of Atlantic City, where I am based out of shout out to everybody listening Jersey, but talking about, some of the challenges our senior citizens are having when there are these kind of extreme weather events. so that should be really good. I am looking forward to that one, too. And that one comes out on November. Sean Sublette: So we have got a lot of good stuff in the pipeline in the weeks ahead, but for now, we are going to close up shop. So for Joe Martucci at the Jersey Shore. Matt Hollner in Chicagoland. I am meteorologist Sean Subletz at the Richmond Times dispatch. We will talk with you next time. Thanks for listening to the across the sky podcast.

Storm Babet - the second named storm of the season after Agnes last month - will bring torrential rain and high winds that could cause widespread flooding and pose a danger to life. Yellow weather warnings are already in force from tomorrow until Saturday, with more than a month's worth of rain set to fall. But the alert is likely to be escalated and reach amber or even red in parts of Scotland. A red warning is issued only when dangerous weather is forecast and it is 'very likely there will be a risk to life'. Treacherous driving amid the recent flooding People are then advised to avoid travelling where possible and to take action to keep safe. Red warnings are rare in Scotland, with the last one coming in November 2021 during the gale-force winds of Storm Arwen. Storm Babet is forecast to cause 'a very nasty spell of weather', and Scotland is likely to bear the brunt of it. Up to 20cm (8in) of rain is expected to fall in central and eastern areas compared with the typical October total of just under 17cm (6.5in). Downpours may cause 'fast-flowing and deep floodwater' that could pose a 'danger to life' and the transport network could suffer major disruption. The heaviest rain is expected in the East, with the ground already saturated in many areas after recent flooding. A month's worth of rain fell in a 24-hour period from October 7-8, triggering landslides and trapping drivers. More than a month's worth of rain set to fall Ten motorists were airlifted to safety after 2,000 tons of debris swept across the A83. Large parts of the rail network were also shut down as lines were turned into rivers. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), working with the Met Office, will issue flood alerts and warnings ahead of the latest storm sweeping in. Forecasters say people should not be fooled by a brief respite of some dry weather expected on Thursday before 70mph winds arrive. Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: 'We are expecting some exceptionally wet weather in Scotland later in the week. 'We are on yellow warnings at the moment but that may well change. I would not be surprised if we saw an amber warning and it is not out of the bounds of possibility that it could go further than that. We could be seeing some really nasty pictures of flooding.' David Morgan, flood duty manager for Sepa, said: 'Storm Babet will bring heavy rain and high winds across Scotland from Wednesday evening, starting in the South-West before moving across to the North-East through Thursday and into the weekend. 'Flood alerts and warnings will be issued as required. If you live or work in an area that could be affected, consider any steps you need to take now to be prepared and stay safe, and to take extra care if you need to travel.' The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has urged the public to exercise 'extreme caution', particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A semi-trailer truck driver was killed when a train derailed and a railroad bridge collapsed onto Interstate 25 near Pueblo, spilling coal and mangled rail cars onto the roadway and shutting it down indefinitely, authorities said Monday. The truck driver was initially said to be trapped in the Sunday afternoon crash on I-25, but on Monday the Pueblo County Coroner's Office said Lafollette Henderson, 60, of Compton, Calif., died on scene. No other vehicles were involved, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said. Photos and videos posted by authorities showed a partially collapsed bridge over the interstate with the semi-truck caught beneath in the right lane. The images also showed a pileup of train cars, train wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway near mile marker 107. The highway remained closed Monday. The Colorado Department of Transportation said it would be an extended closure. Local News Federal authorities will not investigate Union Pacific train derailment in Colorado Springs By Mary Shinn mary.shinngazette.com The train consisted of five locomotives and 124 cars carrying coal, according to an email from the National Transportation Safety Board. A total of 30 cars derailed. A team of four NTSB investigators arrived on the scene (Monday), an NTSB spokesperson said by email. The team comprises specialists in track discipline, mechanical discipline, and railroad operations. The team will also be in communication with NTSB highway safety experts at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. As part of this investigation, NTSB investigators will determine the probable because of the derailment and examine the adequacy of track inspections, oversight of track maintenance, the bridge's structure and maintenance, and any issues with rail equipment. A preliminary report will be available within 30 days, containing information gathered during the initial phase of the investigation, according to the NTSB email. A final report is expected in 12-24 months. The recommended detour between Colorado Springs and Pueblo is Colorado 115 and YOU.S. 50. Northbound traffic will have to divert off at exit 101 (YOU.S. 50 westbound). Southbound traffic is being diverted onto Overton Road via exit 110, according to State Patrol, which said to expect long delays. The bridge was built in 1958 according to CDOT records, department spokesperson Bob Wilson said. BNSF owns the bridge and is responsible for inspecting it, he said. It was not immediately known whether the truck was caught beneath the collapsing bridge or if it somehow caused the collapse, Perez said.

Officials did not provide details about the truck driver's death, citing an ongoing investigation. Until investigators are able to assess the scene, it is unknown what the timeline for the highway's reopening will be, said Perez. Between 39,000 and 44,000 vehicles daily use I-25, according to Shipley. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations on the derailment and collapse. He said officials would be ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. Unlike highway bridges, government agencies do not catalog rail bridges and it is largely up to the railroads to inspect and maintain them. Federal officials monitor the inspection programs through audits but there is no inventory on the condition of the bridges. There are somewhere between 61,000 and more than 100,000 railroad bridges across the YOU.S., according to figures provided by the Federal Railway Administration. The agency defines bridges as having a span of 20 feet or more, whereas some railroads count even short crossings over culverts as bridges. Congress established the parameters of the government's oversight of bridges and railway administration officials have previously said they were not able to alter that approach unilaterally. A railroad bridge collapse along a Montana Rail Link route in southern Montana in June sent railcars with oil products plunging into the Yellowstone River, spilling molten sulfur and up to 250 tons (226.7 metric tons) of hot asphalt. That collapse remains under investigation and involved a steel truss bridge That is different than the type of bridge that Colorado officials said collapsed on Sunday. The bridge near Pueblo was a 188-feet long steel girder bridge, said Wilson. It was 14 feet feet wide with a clearance of 16.3 feet, he said. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said just a few hours before Biden was set to take off for the trip that it would be rescheduled. The derailment near Pueblo comes less than a week after a train derailed October 9 in Colorado Springs. A Union Pacific Railroad train that was carrying Fort Carson equipment home from California went off the tracks on the south side of Colorado Springs. 4th Infantry Division spokesman Lt. Col. Joseph Payton said 13 cars were derailed -- five of them catastrophically, near the El Paso County jail along Las Vegas Street. The cars were carrying 15 pieces of Fort Carson equipment. The vehicles belong to the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team.  Jesse Bedayn, Colleen Slevin, Sarah Brumfield, Josh Funk and Matthew Brown of the Associated Press reported on the story.

Here is what you need to know about the controversial chemical substance: The rights group said late on Thursday that it had verified Israel's use of white phosphorus munitions through interviews and videos showing that the chemical substance was fired upon two locations along the Israel-Lebanon border and over the Gaza City port. White phosphorous is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and because egregious harm to civilians, said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at HRW in a statement. Asked for comment on the allegations, Israel's military said on Friday that it was currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza. It did not provide comment on the rights watchdog's allegations of their use in Lebanon. White phosphorus is a wax-like, toxic substance that burns at more than 800 degrees Celsius (nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit) - high enough to melt metal. Its ability to ignite fast-spreading fires and thick smoke over wide areas has made white phosphorus a toxic substance of choice for militaries to create smokescreens. The smoke tends to last for approximately seven minutes. It is often colourless, white, or yellow and has a garlic-like odour. White phosphorus munitions are extremely difficult to extinguish, continuing to flare until the phosphorous has been completely burned out or until it is no longer exposed to oxygen. It can be deployed through artillery shells, bombs, rockets or grenades. Airbursting white phosphorus spreads the substance over a wide area, depending on the altitude of the burst, and it exposes more civilians and infrastructures than a localized ground burst, Ahmed Benchemsi, MENA Communications Director at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera. White phosphorus can burn the skin down to the bone and the chemicals can be absorbed by the body, causing dysfunction in multiple organs including the liver, kidneys and heart. The burns have a double effect - they have a local effect because of the burn itself which is generally quite severe and very deep, and then the second effect is metabolic, which can kill the patients, said Roman Hossein Khonsari, professor of maxillofacial surgery and plastic surgery at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris. He said that metabolic disorders can include abnormal potassium levels that because heart failure. Khonsari, who worked in Yerevan during the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, said that if burns are not identified by doctors as being caused by white phosphorus, the victim may not receive the necessary care for organ failure risks. Khonsari also explained that phosphorus burns continue to pierce through the skin, even reaching the bone, until the substance is properly washed out. White phosphorus, which can stick to many surfaces such as clothes, can also reignite if it comes into contact with the skin again. It can also be lethal if inhaled, and the fumes can severely irritate eyes and make them sensitive to light. White phosphorus is not banned by international conventions because it does not count as an incendiary weapon - one that is intended to light fire or because burns. Instead, it is considered a multipurpose munition. Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons only prohibits incendiaries or the use of other substances to attack civilian populations. Burns or injuries caused by white phosphorus are considered incidental effects, allowing militaries to argue that it is used only as a smokescreen, signal, or to illuminate a target. Though not signatories to Protocol III, the US and Israel claim that their use of white phosphorous is in line with international regulations. In its manual on rules of warfare, Israel has said that phosphorous is no different from petrol gasoline reacting to a lighted match, and what differentiates it from chemical weapons is that its reaction is not directed against the human physiology. Khonsari, however, explained that burns caused by substances like petrol do not tend to be lethal if they cover a small area of the body, unlike those caused by white phosphorus. In addition to HRW's latest claim of its use, a 2009 HRW report found that Israel extensively used white phosphorus munitions during its 22-day-long Operation Cast Lead in Gaza that lasted from December 27, 2008 until January 18, 2009. At the time, Israel shifted between confirming and denying its use of white phosphorus munitions. In 2009, military spokespeople first said that it was being used to mark targets, but later denied that white phosphorus was being used at all. In the weeks after, Israeli officials ordered an investigation into the use of white phosphorus but maintained that it was in line with international standards. The Israeli military repeatedly exploded white phosphorus munitions in the air over populated areas, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital, according to the 2009 HRW report. It added that the forces had a nonlethal alternative available and used the white phosphorus air bursts even when no Israeli forces were present on the ground, suggesting that it was not used as an obscurant but instead as an incendiary.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

In his letter, the Rajya Sabha MP said that the government introducing luxury trains in a frenzy while the infrastructure for trains for common people is being sorely forsaken. I write to you about the regrettable ways in which railway safety is being compromised despite repeated warnings on how this neglect can gravely impact the people of the country. When the wounds of the Balasore train crash are yet to heal, the derailment of North East Express today in the Buxar District of Bihar came as another grim reminder of where the priorities of the government are going wrong, the MP said, adding, Luxury trains are being introduced in a frenzy while the infrastructure for the trains of the common people is being sorely forsaken. Quoting the data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), The Upper House CPI MP Binoy Viswam further said that fatalities from train-related accidents are over 23000 per year between 2010-2021. Today's tragedy has already claimed 6 lives and more than 100 are injured. The monetary cost of the derailment is estimated to be above 50 crores. Fatalities from train-related accidents are over 23000 per year between 2010-2021 according to NCRB data. For 2021 alone, 88 collisions and 21 derailments were reported. Despite these alarming numbers, the government engaged in photo-ops and PR management instead of taking concrete measures, he added. He also alleged that the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh remains critically unutilized even after so many train accidents. The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) which was created with the aim of clearing the backlog of critical safety and related works of the ministry, including track renewals, strengthening of bridges, and signalling improvements among others remains critically unutilised. It is flagged by many including the CAG that RRSK's execution is lagging behind the short deployment of funds and has defeated the objectives of improving railway safety, the CPI leader said. Binoy Viswam further said that it is common knowledge that critical jobs related to railway safety are being handled by outsourced or contractual workers reflecting poorly on the seriousness of the government about the safety of citizens. CPI MP also urged to Railway Minister to realign the priorities of the railways towards the common people. I also request you to sanction generous compensation to the kin of the victims of the Buxar accident and to the injured. Those responsible for this tragedy should be brought to book and this should serve as a delayed reminder that these mishaps should be prevented at any cost in future, he added. The North East Express train was going from Anand Vihar Terminal, Delhi to Kamakhya in Assam when its 21 coaches derailed at 21.35 on Wednesday near Raghunathpur station of the Danapur division of the East Central Railway.

(AP) -- Passenger railroads nationwide will now be required to install video recorders inside their locomotives, but the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday the new rule is flawed because it excludes freight trains like the one that derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio earlier this year. The Federal Railroad Administration did not respond directly to the criticism of the rule requiring cameras showing both the train crew's actions and a view from the front of passenger trains. FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said freight railroads were not addressed because a 2015 law Congress passed only required regulators to establish a rule for passenger railroads. But many freight railroads, including all the biggest ones that handle a majority of shipments nationwide, have installed cameras voluntarily, starting with outward-facing cameras and later adding ones showing the crews' actions.

A spokeswoman for the American Short Line and Railroad Association said only a few short-line railroads have them and most of those are only outward-facing cameras. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement that the FRA's belief that the cost 'could outweigh the safety benefits' is an affront to every community that is experienced a freight or freight-passenger rail disaster. The Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February did have cameras, but Homendy said that because there are no federal standards for those cameras, investigators have only 20 minutes of footage from before that derailment. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio Though many in the freight rail industry have opted to install recorders voluntarily, there is absolutely no standard for the number of hours of data they must preserve after an accident, Homendy said. East Palestine is a striking example: instead of having 12 hours' worth of in cab video, as we have recommended, our investigators only have access to a 20-minute recording -- not nearly enough to help us or the FRA identify critical safety improvements needed to prevent similar accidents from reoccurring. Homendy said the new rule also fails to require audio recordings inside the cabs of locomotives. The NTSB made its recommendation to add cameras in locomotives in 2010 after it investigated the deadly 2008 collision between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California. That crash killed 25 people, including the Metrolink engineer, and injured more than 100. But the NTSB said such cameras would have been useful in dozens of other crashes because they can help determine what caused them, particularly when the train crew was killed or cannot remember key details. Investigators determined that the Metrolink engineer was sending and receiving text messages on his cell phone before the crash, and he ran a red signal light before slamming into the Union Pacific freight train. Congress responded to that Chatsworth collision by requiring railroads to develop and install an automatic braking system that might have prevented it -- something that took more than a decade and roughly 15 billion to complete. And regulators banned cell phone use by train operators. Later, lawmakers also required regulators in the 2015 law to look at requiring locomotive video recorders for passenger trains. Amtrak pledged in 2015 to install cameras on its trains after a crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured about 200. This new rule will require cameras on all intercity commuter and passenger trains as well. While video recorders cannot directly prevent accidents, they help maintain a higher standard of safety, said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. In addition, these devices play a vital role in post-accident investigations, providing valuable evidence that helps us understand the circumstances leading to the accident and take appropriate action to prevent similar accidents in the future.

Awareness to the bedbug crisis was first raised last week as it emerged the French were experiencing a 'living hell' fighting off a plague of the insects that feed on the blood of animals and humans. But this week, Sadiq Khan warned that the possibility of bedbugs on London's public transport was a 'real source of concern' and that he had contacted officials in Paris after the French capital became overwhelmed by an outbreak with the insects reported in schools, trains, hospitals and cinemas. Now, a pest control company which operates in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and London has said that staff are facing 25 call-outs a week, which is up from just 'one or two' a month ago. Luton is a particular hotspot for bedbugs at the moment, with residents throwing their beds away, ripping up carpets and evacuating their homes. A bedbug is seen on a glove of a biocide technician from Hygiene Premium in Paris on September 29 Fears are growing of a bedbug outbreak in the UK - similar to that seen in France over recent weeks. Pictured: Specialists on a bedbug call-out Britain's bedbug infestation is said to be getting worse with pest-control teams revealing they are the busier than ever. Pictured: A bedbug outbreak on bedding Luton Council's website this week warned residents it 'does not have limitless resources' to tackle the 'obnoxious pest', adding treating properties was 'not free'. What are bedbugs, how do they spread and how do you get rid of them? Bedbugs are oval-shaped insects with six legs that can reach up to 7mm in lengthThe parasites originated in the Middle East and have been around for at least 3,550 yearsThey feed on blood and their bites can leave skin rashes and because allergic reactionsDespite their Latin name being Cimex lectularius which means 'bug of the bed', the insects can be found in many hidden crevices such as sofas and cushions as these are safe places to lay their eggsThe pests can live for several months without a blood meal, meaning they can linger in furniture and suitcases for long after their last biteCommon signs you might have bedbugs include: Rusty or reddish smears on your sheets, dark spotting from dried bedbug fecal matter, a musty smell in your roomBedbugs can spread via light switches and electrical outlets and be brought into homes by latching on to luggageWhile bedbugs because itching and a lack of sleep, they are not known to spread disease and bites normally clear up within two weeksExperts recommend not unpacking clothes when staying in hotels and keeping luggage off the floor and zipped upTo get rid of bedbugs, experts recommend washing bedding and clothing on a 60C cycle or packing it in a plastic bag and leaving it in the freezer for three or four days Advertisement It said: 'The national bed bug problem has not missed Luton. The Pest Control Service is currently receiving an alarming number of bed bug jobs on a weekly basis.' Adam Warren, director of Summit Pest Control, told The Times that the problem had flared up in the past six weeks and that Luton was 'busier for bedbugs than I have ever known it'. As the company face a busy time of year, they said the worst infestation was in the affluent village of Radlett, Hertfordshire, where an elderly couple's house was so infested they had to rip out the carpets and throw the beds away. The Times also spoke to Jamie Ramsey, manager of Pests of London, who said they were 'snowed under' with bedbug call-outs at the moment. They serve areas within the M25. The company's call-outs have doubled since last year to around five to ten a day - many from hotels concerned that guests were bringing them to rooms. A third firm, Pest Extractors, said they have seen a recent spike too - not just in Luton but all over, including Stevenage, another hotspot. The spike comes as it has also emerged that insurers will not pay out over bedbug infestations. Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, and other firms who provide home cover have confirmed the cost of removing bedbugs or repairing damage is not included in most policies. The Association of British Insurers urged customers to look if there was any additional cover they could get as fears grow over an infestation. Cover is likely to vary between home insurance policies, with many not covering the cost of damage caused by vermin and pests,' a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'The costs of disinfestation might be covered under some add-ons to cover, like emergency home assistance. So, the advice on this is to check the cover provided under your policy.' Aviva said its standard home insurance policies exclude 'moths, vermin, insects, fungus, damp, rust, wet or dry rot'. Admiral said it also excluded damage and that its Home Emergency add-on would not cover bedbugs. Axa also said it would not cover bedbugs.

But experts fear Brits heading to Marseille for England's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Fiji on Sunday could bring the insects back with them. One rugby fan told MailOnline she plans to 'actively avoid' sitting on public transport and has started having 'nightmares' about bedbugs after watching videos of the critters on social media. Nic Shacklock from Online-Bedrooms said: 'It is estimated over a million fans are heading to the Rugby Village. 'If everyone is using public transport while Paris is gripped by a bed bug infestation, it is more than likely an outbreak is heading to our shores.' He added: 'It is worth placing bin bags or thick plastic bags on seats while using the Metro as they do not like to cling onto smooth plastic materials. 'We also advise being cautious when you arrive at the hotel room. Check under your bed sheets and strip the entire room as the bugs can be hiding within the mattress and on the sofa.' Professor Lucy Easthope, who has worked on the response to global events including the 911 and 77 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and Covid-19, has warned that Britain is 'not ready' for an invasion of bedbugs. The French government is battling to contain a bout of nationwide panic, with several secondary schools closing due to the infestation. Footage shows residents walking past discarded mattresses in one of the streets in Marseille and Lyon, with some of the items lying in the road and others propped up against buildings. Locals are also chucking out their home furnishings because of the issue, with a placard reading 'bedbugs' pinned to the headboard of a bed to warn others not to take it.

But some experts have disputed whether the creature is indeed a bedbug, with one saying it was not 'flat enough' and another saying that the clip 'looks wrong.' Mr Khan said he was concerned, but TfL was doing everything it could to ensure the bedbug infestation in France does not spread to public transport in London. He told PoliticsJOE: 'This is a real source of concern, right? People are worried about these bugs in Paris causing a problem in London. 'I was in contact with TfL last week and this weekend. We are taking steps to make sure we do not have those problems in London, in relation to regular cleaning of not just the Tubes and our buses, but talking to the Eurostar as well. 'TfL have one of the best regimes to clean our assets on a nightly basis. We are speaking to our friends in Paris to see if there are any lessons to be learned. For a variety of reasons we do not think those issues will arise in London - but no complacency from TfL.' TfL has confirmed that it is monitoring trains and buses for any indication that the infestation could have reached the UK.

Please email: tipsdailymail.com A pest control expert has revealed how to protect your home against pesky bed bugs amid fears that the insects have travelled over from France. This week, Sadiq Khan warned that the possibility of bedbugs on London's public transport was a 'real source of concern'. He said that he had contacted officials in Paris after the French capital became overwhelmed by an outbreak with the insects reported in schools, trains, hospitals and cinemas. Many fear that bed bugs have made their way over to the UK, as people have spotted them in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Now, Richard Grimes, Managing Director and Pest Control Expert at Acorn Environment Services, has revealed how you can banish the insects from your home. Has your house been infested by bed bugs? Please email: tipsdailymail.com Richard Grimes, Managing Director and Pest Control Expert at Acorn Environment Services, has revealed how you can banish the insects from your home He said: 'Bed bugs are not picky and they can very easily hitch a ride on our luggage or clothes, making it incredibly easy for this infestation to find its way to the UK. 'That is why it is so important for Brits to have the information they need to protect themselves and their homes.' READ MORE: UK Bedbugs crisis: Put your duvets in the freezer, landlords tell tenants as national panic descends with London Underground passengers refusing to sit on train seats and council swamped with 'alarming number of calls' Advertisement While bed bugs may seem small and harmless, they can soon take over your whole house. For some, their bites are uncomfortable, showing up on skin as itchy red bumps as they feast on human and animal blood. Mr Grimes said that bed bugs have 'a reddish-brown, flat, oval bodies and leave itchy bites that are either in a line or clusters.' He recommends that Brits remove the clutter from their homes and avoid storing items on the floor. The pest expert said that those struggling with an infestation should wash bedding and clothing at a high temperature. 'Bed bugs and their eggs cannot survive at temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius, so high temperature washes and tumble drying for at least 30 minutes can help to kill them off,' said Mr Grimes. Rik Smith, director of tenancy services at Goodlord, has also issued a series of tips to tenants worried about their bugs - ranging from the extreme to the bizarre. If you are concerned that you may have brought the bugs into the house, Mr Smith says you should 'put affected clothes and bedding in the freezer for a few hours before washing'. You should also take steps to 'wash bedding and clothes on a hot wash (at least 60C) and tumble dry on a hot setting for 30 minutes'. When that is done, it is important to hoover the house thoroughly and empty the bag - as the bugs may still be alive in there. Bedbugs are seen in a sofa bed in L'Hay-les-Roses near Paris, France, last week He explained: 'They are incredibly small - 5 to 7mm long - and it is easy for them to get into a home without anyone noticing. READ MORE: Rugby fan heading to Marseille for the World Cup 'has been having nightmares' about bedbugs and will avoid sitting on public transport - as visitors bring their own bedsheets Advertisement 'Considering the bugs can live for up to six months without food, one of the most difficult problems people face is the fact they are so hard to remove - and may only be noticed when there is a full infestation.' A pest control company which operates in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and London has said that staff are facing 25 call-outs a week, which is up from just 'one or two' a month ago. Luton is a particular hotspot for bedbugs at the moment, with residents throwing their beds away, ripping up carpets and evacuating their homes. Luton Council's website this week warned residents it 'does not have limitless resources' to tackle the 'obnoxious pest', adding treating properties was 'not free'. It said: 'The national bed bug problem has not missed Luton. The Pest Control Service is currently receiving an alarming number of bed bug jobs on a weekly basis.' Adam Warren, director of Summit Pest Control, told The Times that the problem had flared up in the past six weeks and that Luton was 'busier for bedbugs than I have ever known it'. As the company face a busy time of year, they said the worst infestation was in the affluent village of Radlett, Hertfordshire, where an elderly couple's house was so infested they had to rip out the carpets and throw the beds away. The Times also spoke to Jamie Ramsey, manager of Pests of London, who said they were 'snowed under' with bedbug call-outs at the moment. They serve areas within the M25. Britain's bedbug infestation is said to be getting worse with pest-control teams revealing they are the busier than ever. Pictured: A bedbug outbreak on bedding Fears are growing of a bedbug outbreak in the UK - similar to that seen in France over recent weeks. Pictured: Specialists on a bedbug call-out A bedbug is seen on a glove of a biocide technician from Hygiene Premium in Paris on September 29 The company's call-outs have doubled since last year to around five to ten a day - many from hotels concerned that guests were bringing them to rooms. READ MORE: Bedbug infestation is 'getting worse' with pest-control experts 'busier than ever' - but insurers 'will not pay out to cover cost of removing them or repairing damage' Advertisement A third firm, Pest Extractors, said they have seen a recent spike too - not just in Luton but all over, including Stevenage, another hotspot. The spike comes as it has also emerged that insurers will not pay out over bedbug infestations. Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, and other firms who provide home cover have confirmed the cost of removing bedbugs or repairing damage is not included in most policies. The Association of British Insurers urged customers to look if there was any additional cover they could get as fears grow over an infestation. Cover is likely to vary between home insurance policies, with many not covering the cost of damage caused by vermin and pests,' a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'The costs of disinfestation might be covered under some add-ons to cover, like emergency home assistance. So, the advice on this is to check the cover provided under your policy.' Aviva said its standard home insurance policies exclude 'moths, vermin, insects, fungus, damp, rust, wet or dry rot'. Admiral said it also excluded damage and that its Home Emergency add-on would not cover bedbugs. Axa also said it would not cover bedbugs. Transport for London (TfL) has begun disinfecting Tube seats on a daily basis to stop infestations. Britons have been sharing several videos of suspected bedbugs on social media as fears grow Video shows a backstreet in Marseille filled with home furnishings abandoned during the crisis But experts fear Brits heading to Marseille for England's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Fiji on Sunday could bring the insects back with them. One rugby fan told MailOnline she plans to 'actively avoid' sitting on public transport and has started having 'nightmares' about bedbugs after watching videos of the critters on social media. Nic Shacklock from Online-Bedrooms said: 'It is estimated over a million fans are heading to the Rugby Village. 'If everyone is using public transport while Paris is gripped by a bed bug infestation, it is more than likely an outbreak is heading to our shores.' What are bedbugs, how do they spread and how do you get rid of them? Bedbugs are oval-shaped insects with six legs that can reach up to 7mm in lengthThe parasites originated in the Middle East and have been around for at least 3,550 yearsThey feed on blood and their bites can leave skin rashes and because allergic reactionsDespite their Latin name being Cimex lectularius which means 'bug of the bed', the insects can be found in many hidden crevices such as sofas and cushions as these are safe places to lay their eggsThe pests can live for several months without a blood meal, meaning they can linger in furniture and suitcases for long after their last biteCommon signs you might have bedbugs include: Rusty or reddish smears on your sheets, dark spotting from dried bedbug fecal matter, a musty smell in your roomBedbugs can spread via light switches and electrical outlets and be brought into homes by latching on to luggageWhile bedbugs because itching and a lack of sleep, they are not known to spread disease and bites normally clear up within two weeksExperts recommend not unpacking clothes when staying in hotels and keeping luggage off the floor and zipped upTo get rid of bedbugs, experts recommend washing bedding and clothing on a 60C cycle or packing it in a plastic bag and leaving it in the freezer for three or four days Advertisement He added: 'It is worth placing bin bags or thick plastic bags on seats while using the Metro as they do not like to cling onto smooth plastic materials. 'We also advise being cautious when you arrive at the hotel room. Check under your bed sheets and strip the entire room as the bugs can be hiding within the mattress and on the sofa.' Professor Lucy Easthope, who has worked on the response to global events including the 911 and 77 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and Covid-19, has warned that Britain is 'not ready' for an invasion of bedbugs. The French government is battling to contain a bout of nationwide panic, with several secondary schools closing due to the infestation. Footage shows residents walking past discarded mattresses in one of the streets in Marseille and Lyon, with some of the items lying in the road and others propped up against buildings. Locals are also chucking out their home furnishings because of the issue, with a placard reading 'bedbugs' pinned to the headboard of a bed to warn others not to take it. Concerns have grown over a bedbug infestation in London after a video went viral over the weekend of what was claimed to be a bedbug on a person's leg on the Victoria line. But some experts have disputed whether the creature is indeed a bedbug, with one saying it was not 'flat enough' and another saying that the clip 'looks wrong.' Mr Khan said he was concerned, but TfL was doing everything it could to ensure the bedbug infestation in France does not spread to public transport in London. He told PoliticsJOE: 'This is a real source of concern, right? People are worried about these bugs in Paris causing a problem in London. 'I was in contact with TfL last week and this weekend. We are taking steps to make sure we do not have those problems in London, in relation to regular cleaning of not just the Tubes and our buses, but talking to the Eurostar as well. 'TfL have one of the best regimes to clean our assets on a nightly basis. We are speaking to our friends in Paris to see if there are any lessons to be learned. For a variety of reasons we do not think those issues will arise in London - but no complacency from TfL.' TfL has confirmed that it is monitoring trains and buses for any indication that the infestation could have reached the UK. The entrance to the UGC Odeon cinema, where a worker claims to have found bedbugs, in Paris A TfL spokesman said: 'We are continuing to closely monitor our network but are not aware of any outbreaks in London. 'We are continuing to implement our rigorous and thorough cleaning measures that have been proven to keep both the interior and exterior of our trains clean. 'We are committed to providing a clean and safe environment on our bus, Tube and rail service for our customers and staff, and we would like to reassure our customers that we continue to maintain our already high standards of cleanliness, so our staff and customers can use the network safely and with confidence.' QA What is the problem? Bedbugs are no strangers to the UK but there have been concerns about sightings in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Pest control firm Rentokil says infestations have soared 65 per cent over the past year. Why is Luton affected? The Bedfordshire town, as with London and Manchester, is a major international transport hub. Planes fly to French cities including Paris, the epicentre of an outbreak, Lyon and Nice. Luton is also within the London commuter belt. How is France hit? Scenes of discarded mattresses around Paris indicate the scale of the issue. There are also reports of infestations in seats and soft furnishings in public buildings and mass transport systems. MP Mathilde Panot recently took a test tube filled with dead bedbugs into the Paris parliament to highlight the problem in 'hospitals, schools, workplaces, retirement homes, prisons, trains and cinema theatres'. What can we do? Bedbugs are difficult to have removed. They are so small they can get inside mattresses plus folds in fabrics and clothing. Treating an infestation in a house can cost 600 to 800 for an average three-bed house - though multiple treatments are often needed. The process is also disruptive as beds need to be stripped and wardrobes, drawers and shelves emptied with contents sealed. Occupants also must leave the property. How do I treat bites? These can be uncomfortable and itchy and may lead to swelling but usually not worse - with an extreme and life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, being a rare side-effect. They generally subside after about a week but measures can be taken to reduce discomfort, such as putting a cool, damp cloth on the affected area and avoiding scratching. Antihistamines or a mild steroid cream can also help.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

He stopped and looked at Sheila Katz, one of the Jewish leaders gathered at the White House just four days after Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,300 people in Israel, including young children. You OK, kiddo? he asked, pausing behind a lectern he would been pounding as he described taking his children to see the Nazi death camps. I felt really seen by him, Katz, the CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, recalled in an interview. In that moment, to have the president of the country pause his remarks to check in on me was really moving. Not everyone at the White House is OK these days. Hamas' attack has shaken an administration that feels a deep emotional bond with Israel and the Jewish community. Biden and members of his team -- some of whom have family in Israel -- have been grieving over reports of hostage-takings and mass murder. They are juggling ordinary White House business with a crisis that is anything but, all the while coordinating a response to a war that has upended the Middle East. We are bracing ourselves for what comes next, said a White House aide who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss how colleagues are coping with the war. A White House official working on the response to the attack said that at different times this week, every member of the team has looked at one another teary-eyed. In meetings, people will start speaking and their voices will crack, another official said. Some Biden administration aides have family members or friends who are serving in the Israeli military. As the body count rises, they have been carrying out assignments while texting loved ones to make sure they are safe. We deal with mass casualty events with some amount of frequency on the national security team, a senior official said. But this one has at times felt like more than any one person can bear. It is clear people are carrying their grief with them. Whatever officials may be doing, the war inevitably intrudes. On Tuesday, Biden revealed that YOU.S. citizens are among the hostages taken by Hamas. The next day, the administration said the number of American deaths had climbed to nearly two dozen. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on X horrifying photos of babies murdered and burned by Hamas terrorists, writing that he had shown them to visiting Secretary of State Antony Blinken. An Israeli official said in an interview that the photographs are important, as they make it so much more real to see it. It hurts in your stomach and your gut in such a way that you cannot stay indifferent to it, the official said. It is not in order to persuade. When it comes to anybody who is human and calls himself a human being, you do not need these images to persuade. While the scenes coming out of Israel, including the beginnings of what is expected to be a long, bloody war, hang heavy over the White House, Biden and his aides also appear determined not to let the crisis consume them. Before he addressed Jewish leaders Wednesday, Biden announced a new push to limit junk fees charged by businesses. On Friday, he will travel to Philadelphia for an event devoted to clean energy jobs, and on Monday he will be in Colorado to discuss his economic agenda. Even in the first two days after the attack, Biden was dedicating time to other priorities. Between meetings and phone calls at the White House, he sat for interviews with a special counsel investigating his handling of classified documents from his time as vice president. Behind the scenes, Biden also has taken the time to ask for regular updates about staff members with loved ones living in Israel, an official said. An internal email from White House chief of staff Jeff Zients told staffers about various counseling services available to them and their families. The emotional toll inside the White House has at times spilled into public view. Listening to CNN host Jake Tapper recite the abuses inflicted on Israeli women and children, a polished White House spokesman and retired Navy rear admiral, John Kirby, lost his composure. He turned from the camera to collect himself before answering. Excuse me, Kirby said. Very difficult to look at these images, Jake. Dozens of Jewish aides work in the White House; they are tight-knit. Blinken is Jewish, the stepson of a Holocaust survivor. Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, is also Jewish, and together, the couple hosted a celebration at their residence last month for the High Holy Days. Jewish aides mark religious holidays together and in past years have lit a menorah in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Tom Nides, who left his job as YOU.S. ambassador to Israel in July, said he had just gotten an email from a friend who wrote that his daughter had been found -- dead. It is breaking my heart, Nides said. I know all these people. I know all my staff who are there and their families. It is impossible to describe what is happening in the country. It is beyond comprehension. In the days since Hamas launched its attack, Biden has spoken with a measure of clarity missing in past presidential speeches. The war seems to have energized him, imbuing him with equal parts rage and resolve. At Wednesday's event with Jewish leaders, Biden raised his voice in recalling how he took his children to see the death camps the Nazis built to massacre Jews during World War II. I wanted them to see, he shouted, that you could not not know what was going on walking through those gates! You could not fail to understand as a country what was going on. White House aides said Biden has been deeply involved in crafting the speeches he has delivered this week. In a speech Tuesday, Biden made a point to mention details of the atrocities Hamas committed in breaching Israeli boundary lines. The comments were not part of his original script, aides said. He had just gotten off the phone with Netanyahu, who had told him of women being raped and children being kidnapped and killed. The conversation with Bibi definitely had an effect on him and the way he delivered the speech, an administration official said. Biden, who is Irish Catholic, has ties of his own to Israel and the Jewish diaspora. Biden recalls as a young senator in 1973 visiting then-Prime Minister Golda Meir, who made an indelible impression when she disclosed to him Israel's secret weapon. 'We have no place else to go,' she told him, as Biden has recounted the visit. He feels what the Jewish community has been through, said Ted Kaufman, a former Biden Senate aide and onetime Democratic senator from Delaware. It is the Irish in him. He is someone who feels people's pain. Biden's home state, Delaware, was an incubator for his kinship with the Jewish community. He is close to Congregation Beth Shalom in Wilmington, a synagogue with about 450 families. Michael Beals, the senior rabbi, said he considers the president part of the 'mishpocha,' Yiddish for family network. In the months before Biden became a candidate in the 2020 presidential race, Beals wrote him a letter. At the time, Biden was an ex-vice president whose age was considered a reason he might choose to sit out the race. Beals urged him to run, telling him that in the Jewish tradition, age is an asset -- wisdom -- and you should not count yourself out because of your age. On January 24, 2019, Biden sent back a handwritten letter on vice presidential stationery. You are 'my Rabbi,' and my friend, he wrote. I have had the great honor to meet and be mentored by so many remarkable women and men from 'Golda' Meir to Elie Wiesel, the author and Holocaust survivor. I am indebted to you and to the community in so many ways. You are familiar with the Talmudic saying, 'What comes from the heart enters the heart.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

This was after massive blaze caused one of the terminal car parks to partially collapse. The airport is located 20 miles from London, and it is a popular departure and arrival point for budget airline travellers. Hundreds of flights were cancelled after the huge fire broke out. Flights were suspended until 3pm on Wednesday, 11 October. Around 25,000 airline passengers were impacted by cancellations and delays. Meanwhile, an investigation into the because of the fire has begun. Compensation Are those impacted eligible for compensation? Possibly. A spokesperson for the legal firm Claims.co.uk tells Digital Journal: Whilst booking a package holiday can slash the cost of going away, if your flight is cancelled you can risk having your whole holiday cancelled or rearranged. The statement continues: If you have booked a package holiday and your flights are cancelled, you have the rights to either claim a full refund, a reroute of the trip destination and potentially compensation from the airline. In terms of options: However, in these specific circumstances, delays and cancellations caused by air traffic control restrictions are considered an 'extraordinary circumstance' and therefore do not qualify for compensation. There may also be other circumstances where compensation could be provided: In cases of flight delays and flight cancellations due to an 'extraordinary circumstance,' the airline must provide you with additional services, depending on the length of your delay and waiting time. What might this entail? These additional services include free meals and refreshments, which you are entitled to when your flight is delayed by at least 2 hours. Passengers should also receive a free overnight accommodation and a transfer to and from the airport if the flight is shifted to the next day. In terms of how the process works, if a travel operator needs to cancel a package holiday for any reason, they are required to notify the passenger as soon as possible and without undue delay. This is to ensure that you have enough time to help you make alternative arrangements or seek refunds. If the delay lasts more than five hours, but is not actually cancelled, the passenger should also be able to choose not to travel and get a full refund on your ticket. If your flight cannot be rearranged, meaning the whole holiday must be cancelled, then the travel company must offer an alternative holiday if possible, or a refund of the full package price, not just the flight part. What is the best option? For any person wondering whether to claim a full refund or reschedule your holiday, this depends on personal circumstances. There are several factors you can consider making this decision: Claims.co.uk states further: If you received less than 14 days' notice of the cancellation, you can claim compensation. This can be awarded in pounds or euros depending on where your flight was due to depart from.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

This marks the third consecutive year that CIIE exhibition products have been transported to Shanghai via the China-Europe Freight Train. The Jinbo China-Europe freight train primarily transports exhibition products for the CIIE. The train this year carried mainly cosmetics and mechanical equipment from Fortune Global 500 companies participating in the 6th CIIE, with a total of 70 TEUs and a cargo value exceeding 16 million euros (16.87 million). Departing from Duisburg, Germany, on Sept.21 and passing through Poland, Belarus, Russia, and Kazakhstan, the train entered China through the Alashankou railway port, covering a distance of over 10,000 kilometers in a 20-day journey. Sun Chenghai, deputy director-general of CIIE, said during the reception ceremony that this year's CIIE has achieved record highs in terms of the exhibition area and the number of participating Fortune Global 500 companies and leading industry enterprises. Zhu Yi, vice president of Orient International, one of the companies involved in operating the China-Europe Freight Train, emphasized that the time the China-Europe Freight Train reached Shanghai from Europe is only one-third of sea freight and the transportation cost is significantly lower than air freight. As a flagship brand of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the China-Europe Freight Train offers various advantages, such as year-round availability, high transportation capacity, environmental friendliness, low-carbon footprint, and a guarantee of smooth and safe operations. To better serve the 6th CIIE, the railway authorities have planned to operate three Jinbo China-Europe freight train trains, expecting to transport 210 TEUs of cargo worth over 350 million yuan (48 million). Since its inaugural run in 2021, Jinbohas facilitated European countries and other countriesalong the BRI route to participate in the CIIE, with the starting stations spanning from Duisburg and Hamburg in Germany to Malaszewicze in Poland. A noteworthy development for this year's first Jinbo is the implementation of electronic bills of lading for railway transport, enhancing the digitization of CIIE services and promoting the high-quality development of logistics and financial services in Shanghai. According to the railway authorities, the China-Europe Freight Train (Shanghai) has operated 72 trains this year, transporting 7,272 TEUs, with a total cargo weight of approximately 68,000 tons and a cargo value of about 2.38 billionyuan. It connects more than 60 cities and stations in nine countries in Eurasia, playing a positive role in advancing the BRI and consolidating Shanghai's position as a gateway for the initiative.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

An adviser to Netanyahu said there had been no outreach by Trump in the wake of the attacks. Instead, Trump has leveled repeated broadsides at the leader of a close YOU.S. ally in remarks on the campaign trail as he seeks a return to the White House. He is pissed off because Bibi praised Biden and the Biden White House for being supportive, said a former Trump adviser, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Perhaps most bruising for Trump is the reminder of how Netanyahu left him reeling after the 2020 election by acknowledging his loss, fraying a once-vaunted relationship that stretched back decades and includes close family ties. After he pledged his unwavering support for Israel in remarks at his club in Palm Beach, Florida, this week, Trump accused Netanyahu of failing to stand with the YOU.S. as it prepared to strike a top Iranian general. Israel was going to do this with us, and it was being planned and working on it for months, Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago club Wednesday. We had everything all set to go, and the night before it happened, I got a call that Israel will not be participating in this attack. I will never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing, Trump said. And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That did not make me feel too good. Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi criticized Trump's remarks, telling Israel's Channel 13 that it was shameful that a man like that, a former YOU.S. president, abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel's fighters and its citizens. Trump's public criticism is a departure from when Trump, still in the White House, lavished praise on Netanyahu and worked to bolster him. Both leaders have weathered decades of political and personal strife, surviving repeated crises that have threatened to derail them. Netanyahu returned to power this year after having been charged in a series of criminal scandals that threatened him with prison time, a parallel that some who know Trump say is not lost on him. He looked at Bibi like 'they tried to take him down,' and he bounced back, a former Trump adviser said. In a nod to the federal charges he faces alleging he mishandled classified secrets, Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, quipped to the crowd Wednesday that he could face censure for sharing details of the plot to strike Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. They will say, oh, it is classified information, he said. For days, Trump has sounded off on the attacks, swiped at Biden and grown more vocal in his public jabs at Netanyahu. When I see Bibi Netanyahu come and he tries to talk them into doing something, they never do it, Trump told an audience in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire on Monday after having riffed for nearly an hour on his legal troubles, his political foes and the threat of a third world war and wondered aloud at one point, Nobody's in a hurry, right? before he finally broached in full the massacre by Hamas over the weekend. On Wednesday, Trump also lashed out at Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, calling him a jerk. As the scale of the attacks came into view over the weekend, Trump's campaign rebranded his remarks to supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire to focus on Israel. Yet he brought up the crisis only fleetingly, taking an early opportunity Monday to swipe at Netanyahu, who he said had lost purchase with the YOU.S. since he left office. Trump has long sought to emphasize his appeal to Jewish Americans and has complained when he feels he has not been recognized sufficiently. Even after having left office, Trump has maintained he has done more for Israel and the Middle East than any other YOU.S. president, holding up the historic peace agreements he forged with Arab nations. More recently, Trump's former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who parted with him under fraught circumstances in 2020, has advised Netanyahu, Parscale told NBC News. Parscale has twice traveled to Israel in recent months, and even into Gaza, he said. And even as Trump has sought to tout his support for Israel, he has also faced criticism for not condemning his supporters who have expressed openly antisemitic views, including his decision to meet with Nick Fuentes and his good people on both sides response to the 2017 Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Virginia, that included neo-Nazis. Trump's latest broadsides reveal how he kept frictions with Netanyahu hidden while he was in the White House, working instead to close any daylight between them. These frustrations began to surface as Trump reckoned with the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Netanyahu pissed him off for embracing Biden so fast, or at least how Trump perceived fast, a longtime Trump ally said. (Netanyahu congratulated Biden the day after the election was called in his favor.) Still, this person suggested Netanyahu may face pressure to bridge ties again with Trump, as he leads the Republican field. There are going to be a lot of intermediaries that are probably saying, 'Yes, Bibi needs to make the ask' to reconnect, this person said. Trump chafed at a video in which Netanyahu congratulated Biden after he won the 2020 election. He was very early -- like, earlier than most. I have not spoken to him since. F--k him, Trump told Axios reporter Barak Ravid, referring to Netanyahu. Trump appeared to view the moment as an affront to his loyalty. According to Ravid, Trump has credited his decision to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel with helping Netanyahu politically at a crucial moment. Trump was not yet under indictment at the time of the interview, but Ravid said he showed a pronounced interest in Netanyahu's legal troubles, though he never raised them with Netanyahu. Today, Netanyahu faces considerable headwinds at home as Israelis heap blame on him for the surprise attack. An adviser to Netanyahu speculated that Biden is the most loved person in Israel after he delivered deeply emotive remarks to condemn Hamas' violence as an act of sheer evil. Even Trump's supporters note Biden's unambiguous support of Israel in the days since the attacks. I was very pleasantly surprised by Biden's speech and thought it was important and well-said, said Marc Goldman, a Trump donor and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition. On the other hand, nobody did more than Trump for Israel.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released its report into the July 28, 2022 incident on Thursday, attributing the accident to fatigue and complacency. According to the NTSB, the Cathlamet had just completed a crossing of the Puget Sound with 94 people on board and was approaching the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal when it collided with the dolphin. Fortunately, only one minor injury was reported. The investigation revealed that the ferry's master, who was at the helm, had ceased rudder commands approximately 30 seconds before the collision. However, no corrective action was taken to adjust the ferry's course, reduce speed, or sound an alarm. The master also had no recollection of the events leading up to the collision and appeared unaware of how the ferry ended up striking the dolphin. Investigators concluded that these circumstances were consistent with the master experiencing a momentary lapse of consciousness known as a microsleep, likely caused by fatigue. Fatigue can have significant impacts on decision-making, alertness, and reaction time, stated NTSB investigators in their final report. Mariners need to understand the consequences of sleep deprivation and recognize the dangers of fatigue-related issues, such as microsleeps. When fatigued, mariners should arrange for a qualified watchstander to take over their duties and refrain from being on duty when they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities safely. In addition to fatigue, the NTSB highlighted complacency as a contributing factor in the accident. The Cathlamet's bridge team failed to comply with Washington State Ferries' policies during the docking and undocking procedures. Specifically, the quartermaster did not actively monitor the master as the ferry approached the dock, as required by company policy. This oversight prevented prompt intervention when the master became incapacitated. Complacency arises when operators repeatedly perform tasks without consequence, leading to a diminished awareness of inherent risks, the report explained. To combat complacency, operators should strictly adhere to established procedures, such as operating checklists, to mitigate single points of failure. Companies should also emphasize the importance of following procedures through comprehensive training programs. An internal investigation by Washington State Ferries previously found the Master had lost situational awareness for unknown reasons as the captain refused to answer any questions during the investigation. That investigation did rule out both drugs and alcohol. The NTSB's report serves as a reminder of the critical role fatigue management and adherence to safety protocols play in ensuring the safe operations of maritime transportation. It calls for increased awareness and proactive measures to address fatigue-related risks and combat complacency among ferry operators.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The jury convicted Aurora Police Officer Randy Roedema of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault. Former Aurora officer Jason Rosenblatt was acquitted. Roedema has been suspended without pay while Rosenblatt was fired in 2020 after responding ha ha to a picture texted to him by other officers, one of whom appeared to be administering a chokehold near a memorial for McClain. McClain, 23, had just purchased iced tea from a corner store in Aurora on the night of August 24, 2019, when he was stopped by police. Officers were responding to a report of a suspicious person wearing a ski mask and waving his arms. McClain regularly wore a mask because of a blood disorder that made him feel cold, his family has said. When officers told McClain to stop, the young man said he was an introvert and said please respect the boundaries that I am speaking, bodycam video of the confrontation showed. Officers questioned McClain before they tackled him, believing he was reaching for one of their guns, police said. There is been no evidence showing McClain, who was not armed, attempted take one of the guns. Officer Nathan Woodyard, set to go on trial this week, then put McClain in a chokehold that forced him into unconsciousness, prosecutors have said. He was fired after the incident. A pair of responding paramedics, also set for trial later this year, injected McClain with ketamine to sedate him after police video showed him writhing on the ground saying, I cannot breathe, please, and throwing up. He apologized for vomiting Minutes later, McClain was found to have no pulse in the ambulance and went into cardiac arrest, according to a report released in fall of 2019 by a local prosecutor, Dave Young. McClain was revived but later declared brain dead and then taken off life support. He died on August 30. The deadly confrontation sparked months of protests against police brutality in Colorado, preceding the national demonstrations that erupted in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Adams County prosecutors initially opted against charging the police and paramedics, but Colorado's attorney general intervened and secured indictments against those involved. An independent probe commissioned by the city of Aurora released in 2021 found that officers had no legal basis for detaining McClain and that paramedics on the scene sedated the 5-foo-6, 140-pound young man without conducting anything more than a brief visual observation.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Director General of SON, Farouk Salim, said this on Thursday, during the destruction of some substandard products at the agency's Amuwo Odofin warehouse in Lagos. He noted that Nigeria's cable manufacturing industry is one of the most successful industries in the country. Salim warned that those bringing in these substandard cables are sabotaging the economy. A lot of fire incidences in this country are caused by fake electrical cables and 100 percent of them are not made in Nigeria. This is economic sabotage to our people, country, and individuals and you see that the people bringing in these products are causing economic loss to our country and also a lot of lives and properties, Salim said. Speaking on the destroyed substandard tires, he said, some of the tyres were stuffed together by the importers thereby making them unfit for use. Salim however, added that some of the tires were refurbished tyres. The tyres look new but some of them are new tires that have been processed and made to look like new. And some of them are new tires but unfortunately when the importers were bringing them in they stuffed other tires in them. And because these new ones lose their integrity, the wires inside the tires and broken so the tyres will blow up if you using them that is the reason we are destroying them. The whole idea of this destruction is because all these tires you see are dangers to the society, he added. The SON boss said that they had gotten permission from the court to carry out the destruction. The value is running into billions of naira, we cannot be exact with the amount now.

The accident caused 10 million in damage to the vessel and 300,000 in damage to the dolphin. At about 0800 on July 28, 2022, the ferry Cathlamet was making a routine crossing of the Puget Sound with 94 people aboard. The master took over the helm from his quartermaster at 0810 in preparation for docking. As the ferry approached the Fauntleroy Terminal in West Seattle, it drifted off course. At 0814, four minutes after the master took the helm, it struck a dolphin adjacent to the pier at a speed of 16 knots. One person sustained a minor injury, and two passengers narrowly escaped from harm's way as the dolphin stove in the vessel's topsides. The ferry sustained extensive damage. The moment of contact, as captured by a security camera aboard Cathlamet (WSFNTSB) The vessel was still moving forward after the impact, and it risked hitting a cluster of anchored watercraft next to the terminal. The quartermaster instructed the master to back out three times, after which the master put both engines astern and halted the ferry's motion. According to NTSB, the master stopped making rudder commands about 30 seconds before impact and did not take any action to avert the accident or minimize damage, like backing down or sounding the general alarm. In interviews with investigators, he had no recollection of the moments leading up to the accident. The master's workrest history showed that he had been sleeping 5 to 6 hours a night in the days before the casualty, and he told the Coast Guard that he had had a hard time sleeping because of the heat (Seattle was experiencing a heat wave at the time). The quartermaster told investigators that the master was always tired in the morning. According to NTSB, the evidence was consistent with a microsleep, a brief period of sleep caused by fatigue. Fatigue affects all aspects of human performance, including decision-making, alertness, and reaction time, NTSB investigators concluded. Mariners should understand the performance effects of sleep loss and recognize the dangers of fatigue, such as microsleeps. The NTSB also found that Cathlamet's quartermaster was not monitoring the master as the ferry neared the dock, as is required by company policy. Instead, he was located towards the aft end of the wheelhouse and was focused on reading a company memo. If he had been watching closely, he could have taken over the helm when the master was asleep. NTSB marked this down to complacency, and noted that extra vigilance is required to prevent complacent attitudes for repetitive operations, such as ferry transits. The day after the casualty, the master retired from Washington State Ferries, surrendered his Merchant Mariners' Credential and ceased providing information for the investigation, according to NSTB.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

White phosphorus is a chemical that ignites when it is exposed to oxygen and causes severe burns when it comes in contact with human skin. It can also set structures, fields, and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire, HRW said, adding that it had verified two videos depicting Israel's use of white phosphorus. Human Rights Watch confirmed on Thursday that Israel used white phosphorus in military operations in the Gaza Strip and along the Israel-Lebanon border. White phosphorus is a chemical that ignites when it is exposed to oxygen and can cause severe burns when it comes into contact with human skin. It can also set structures, fields, and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire, HRW said. The organization said it confirmed the veracity of two videos depicting the use of white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and rural areas along Israel's border with Lebanon. Israel's use of white phosphorus comes as it mounts a heavy response to Hamas' deadly terror attacks in the south of Israel on Saturday. White phosphorus is classified as an incendiary munition because it works using heat, as opposed to chemical weapons, which operate by toxicity. In addition to verifying the two videos, HRW also interviewed two people who described the use of the munitions over Gaza. The use of white phosphorus in populated civilian areas is a violation of international humanitarian law, and HRW said it believes the IDF's deployment of white phosphorus over Gaza was unlawful. Any time that white phosphorus is used in crowded civilian areas, it poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering, Lama Fakih, the Middle East and North Africa director at HRW, said in a report published by the organization. White phosphorous is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and because egregious harm to civilians. It is not the first time Israel has been accused of using white phosphorus in Gaza. HRW also published a report in 2009 saying that the IDF made extensive use of the incendiary bombs in a 22-day military operation in Gaza and deployed them over densely populated neighborhoods, killing and wounding civilians, and hitting buildings including a school, a hospital, and a humanitarian aid warehouse. As of Thursday, Israeli officials said 1,300 people had died as a result of the Hamas terror attacks and 2,800 were wounded. Militants also kidnapped 100-150 people, including women, children, and the elderly, and are holding them hostage in Gaza, authorities said. Since Israel launched its counteroffensive in Gaza, the Palestinian health ministry said that 1,417 Gazans have died and 6,200 are wounded. Nearly one-third of those who died were children. In addition to its military response, Israel cut off the supply of food, water, fuel, and electricity to Gaza, a move that some human rights advocates say is a violation of international law. It is also mobilizing for a ground operation that could further decimate the civilian population in Gaza. Gaza's health system is also at a breaking point as it strains to stay functional with no access to electricity, officials and humanitarian aid groups said. The International Red Cross warned that if Israel's retaliatory strikes continue, then hospitals in the region could soon turn into morgues.

If convicted, the suspects could face life in prison. The illicit consignment arrived at Melbourne from Malaysia on October 4, and Australian Border Force officers noticed something unusual during x-ray screening of the cargo. They notified the Australian Federal Police (AFP), who inspected the shipment and launched an investigation. According to the AFP, the cargo contained 622 packages labeled as tea concealed within the pallets of toilet paper. Each package weighed one kilo, and on opening and inspection, they all contained a white crystalline substance identified as methamphetamine. Parceled out for commercial sale, this shipment could have supported 6.2 million individual one-gram street deals worth an estimated US350 million, the authorities claimed. The police quickly identified a team of foreign nationals who were allegedly behind the shipment. On Wednesday, a task force of officers from multiple agencies arrested four men: two 33-year-old Chinese nationals, a Malaysian national, 34, and a Hong Kong national, 32. Two of them were detained at Melbourne's airport as they were preparing to leave Australia. Additional raids at warehouses, storage facilities and homes in the Melbourne area turned up further evidence linked to the imports, police said. The use of methylamphetamine per capita in Australia is matched by no other nation in the world, and the devastating and tragic damage caused by its use ripples throughout the community, said Dan Ryan, head detective for the Victoria Police. We see it translate directly into a broad range of areas including road trauma, family violence, homicides, shootings and other violent offending.

Shepard, a gay college freshman at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, was abducted, robbed and beaten into a coma on October 6, 1998. The two men who attacked Shepard tied him to a fence in freezing weather. He was discovered 18 hours later by a bicyclist, who initially mistook him for a scarecrow. Shepard died in a Colorado hospital on October 12, 1998, surrounded by family. Matthew's tragic and senseless murder shook the conscience of the American people, Biden said in a statement. And his courageous parents, Judy and Dennis Shepard, turned Matthew's memory into a movement, galvanizing millions of people to combat the scourge of anti-LGBTQI hate and violence in America. The two assailants, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, were sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder, but they were not charged with hate crimes. At the time, attacks motivated by a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity did not qualify as hate crimes under Wyoming law. Wyoming is currently one of just two states, along with South Carolina, that does not have a law allowing additional penalties in hate-motivated crimes. In 2009, the Obama administration enacted the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The law extended federal hate crimes laws to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and disabilities and was named after Shepard and a Texas Black man who was murdered by white supremacists the same year of Shepard's killing. Biden, who was vice president at the time, lauded the 2009 law on Thursday and vowed to continue the fight against hate, against violence, and against bigotry in all its forms. Today, as threats and violence targeting the LGBTQI community continue to rise, our work is far from finished, he said. No American should face hate or violence for who they are or who they love. Anti-LGBTQ demonstrations have spiked over the past year, in addition to several high-profile acts of violence allegedly incited by anti-LGBTQ sentiments. In August, a teenager was arrested for stabbing a 28-year-old gay professional dancer, O'Shae Sibley, to death at a gas station in Brooklyn, New York, in what police later said was a hate crime. That same month, Laura Ann Carleto, a California business owner and mother of nine, was shot and killed over a Pride flag displayed in her clothing store. From June 2022 to May, there was an average of 39 anti-LGBTQ protests per month in the YOU.S. compared with just three a month from January 2017 through May 2022, according to a recent report by the Crowd Counting Consortium, a research group that tracks political protests.

Within hours of Hamas' brazen and bloody attack on Saturday, Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery at a disputed, Israeli-occupied area along Lebanon's southern border. This was met swiftly with a barrage of Israeli artillery, leading to tit-for-tat combat that has killed nine people. Were Hezbollah to choose to enter the conflict -- a decision that it appears to be considering -- it could offer a muscular challenge to Israel and further internationalize a conflict that has already thrown the Middle East into turmoil. Hezbollah, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the United States and many other countries, heaped further praise Wednesday on Hamas' bloody attacks on southern Israel. Condemning President Joe Biden's support for Israel, it said that it would not cower in the face of American naval assets, including the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, now parked in the eastern Mediterranean. Sending aircraft carriers to the region with the aim of raising the morale of the enemy and its frustrated soldiers reveals the weakness of the Zionist military machine, Hezbollah said in a statement. Our nation and the resistance factions are ready for confrontation until final victory and complete liberation are achieved. To date however, both Israel and Hezbollah appear to be showing restraint -- consistent with the informal rules of engagement that have governed the cross-border conflict for nearly two decades. People close to Hezbollah and experts on the region warn that this could change at any time and the group will make a calculation based on Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip and whether Iran -- which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah -- pushes the group into war. If that happens, Hezbollah has vast supplies of advanced weaponry, advanced training and well-organized ranks of experienced troops who have been bloodied by more than a decade of fighting Sunni Islamist militants in Syria, dwarfing the capability of Hamas. For now though, experts say the group may view its presence on Israel's northern border as a deterrent to a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip by Israel, or it may be holding itself in reserve. Hezbollah may, in part, be trying to confuse Israel, Marwa Osman, a lecturer at the Lebanese International University. The game changer would be the use of massive force or the arrival of YOU.S. forces and equipment to the Palestinian occupied territories, she said. Inside southern Lebanon, at a funeral for two Hezbollah fighters killed in the cross-border shelling on Tuesday, the rage among the crowd of thousands was palpable. Chants of Death to Israel and America, you are the greatest Satan rang out amid Shiite religious prayers and martial music. Ali Zalzali, a local imam, or religious cleric, close to the group and its adherents said a decision on whether to enter the fight was still in the offing. Insisting that the group would not be influenced by Iran, he said it does not wait for a signal from anyone. He added that it would be an independent and internal decision taken by Hezbollah and its revered and secretive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. We are a nation of jihad, and we have offered hundreds, thousands of martyrs and sacrifices, he said. And yet, entering the war would almost certainly cost Hezbollah dearly. Though the Shia Islamist group is primarily a militant organization with an archenemy in Israel, it also has a political party arm that competes in Lebanese parliamentary elections, maintains alliances with other political parties, holds ministerial posts and, on some level, answers to voters among Lebanon's highly sectarian society.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Iran has had a long relationship with Hamas. Hamas would not be Hamas without the support over many, many years from Iran, he told NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt in an interview that will air Thursday evening. And so, we know that. We see that. When it comes to this specific attack, in this moment, we do not have direct evidence that Iran was involved in the attack, either in planning it or carrying it out. He noted, There is a much longer complicity between Iran and Hamas that the world knows and it is one of the reasons that since this administration has been in office, we have sanctioned Iran, individuals companies, more than 400 times including for support to to Hamas. Blinken arrived in Israel on Wednesday with the goal of offering support and solidarity to the longtime YOU.S. ally in the wake of the brutal terrorist attack on people in Israel by Hamas last Saturday. The Biden administration had faced scrutiny over its decision to unfreeze 6 billion in oil reserve funds as part of a prisoner exchange with Iran, which has historically funded Hamas. The White House had insisted that the money, which is held in a Qatari bank, could be used only for humanitarian purposes. Blinken also said Thursday in his interview with NBC News that none of the funds had been distributed yet. The YOU.S. and Qatari governments have now also agreed to block Iran from accessing any of the 6 billion, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House Democrats on Thursday, according to three sources familiar with his remarks, two of whom were in the room. Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and was also slated to meet with other Israeli officials including President Isaac Herzog and members of Israel's cabinet. Blinken said he would also be meeting with YOU.S. embassy personnel in Israel. John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Thursday that the number of American citizens killed during Saturday's terrorist attack had risen to 27, with 14 people also unaccounted for. Blinken announced in joint statements with Netanyahu that the YOU.S. is also working closely with Israel's government to determine the whereabouts of Americans who remain unaccounted for and if they have been taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza. This must be a moment of moral clarity. The failure to unambiguously condemn terrorism puts at risk not only people in Israel, but people everywhere, Blinken said during a joint statement with Netanyahu. Blinken explained that the current situation is personal to him as a Jew himself and because his grandfather fled pogroms in Russia and his stepfather survived three major concentration camps during the Holocaust. I understand, on a personal level, the harrowing echoes that the Hamas massacres carry for Israeli Jews, indeed, for Jews everywhere, he said. The message that I bring to Israel is this. You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side. That is the message that President Biden delivered to the prime minister from the moment this crisis began. Blinken reiterated that the YOU.S. has Israel's back and that it has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean, is supplying more ammunition interceptors to help replenish Israel's Iron Dome and is sending more YOU.S. military support. Blinken told reporters at a separate press conference on Thursday that he was shown graphic photographs, including of dead children and beheaded soldiers. It is hard to find the right words, he said. It is beyond what anyone would ever want to imagine, much less actually see and god forbid experience. A baby, an infant riddled with bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars or in their hideaway rooms. Earlier in the day, Blinken made a previously unscheduled stop at a donation center in Tel Aviv where he met with a survivor of the festival attack in southern Israel on Saturday. Blinken is scheduled to travel to Amman, Jordan on Friday to meet with both Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordanian King Abdullah II. He is also planning to travel to Qatar on Friday to meet with senior officials, a YOU.S. official confirmed on Thursday. His meetings in Doha will focus on joint Qatari-YOU.S. efforts to secure the release of the hostages and to de-escalate, according to a source with knowledge of the visit. At least 1,300 Israelis -- including 222 soldiers -- were killed during Hamas' attack on Saturday and more than 3,300 have been injured. In Gaza, at least 1,400 people have been killed and more than 6,000 injured.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Please try again later verifyErrors  UK holidaymakers and travellers who left their cars at Luton Airport have been left in limbo after a vehicle fire caused a car park to collapse. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it received a report of a car fire on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park 2 at 8.47pm on Tuesday. Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said up to 1,500 vehicles were inside the car park at the time of the fire. Katie Forbes, 42, who lives on the outskirts of Coventry, had travelled to Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands with her husband, daughter and her daughter's boyfriend, due to return on Friday. Having parked their car in Car Park 2, the group have been forced to hire a car for their return, with no information regarding the state of their vehicle. Ms Forbes told the PA news agency: I have had no joy with Luton. I have heard nothing back, I have been tweeting them, everything, and nothing. I get it, they are getting other people that are going to the airport, but to me there is been no apology, not once has anybody said 'we are sorry about the situation'. We are kind of left in limbo. Ms Forbes added her daughter had left her own car keys in the parked car as well, and said the incident had had a negative impact on their holiday. It is hard to do anything, you cannot relax around the pool because you are constantly looking at your phone to see 'have they emailed, have we got an update?' There is just been nothing. An apology goes a long way, it is not an admission of guilt, it is an 'I am sorry you are in this situation' even if they cannot help. Thomas Willett, 29, a content manager for a real estate firm, from Essex, had travelled to Gran Canaria with his partner, arriving on Tuesday evening. Having parked their car on the third floor of Terminal Car Park 2, he said he believes others are being taken care of instead of those looking to confirm the state of their vehicle. I received an email from Luton Airport Parking on Wednesday at 2am telling us to email them to get information about our car, Mr Willett told PA. I have since emailed them three times and contacted them on Twitter over the course of Wednesday and (Thursday) but have heard nothing. We do not know if our car has been damaged or not, or how we will be getting home from the airport. Their duty of care should be to those whose vehicles have been impacted, but they seem to be replying to everyone else with other queries instead. Mr Willett is due to return home on Sunday but said: Currently, we have no means of getting back home. Lucy Lynam, a 42-year-old accountant from Hertfordshire, said she is none the wiser about the state of her car and is expecting the worst. Ms Lynam parked her car on Tuesday morning, as she had to attend a conference in Majorca, and first heard about the fire on Tuesday evening. However, she praised Luton Airport's communication, adding she had been emailed a couple of times with updates. She told PA: I am parked on level 2 against the perimeter fence (facing row C), nearest the apron, which, from the videos, seems where the bulk of the damage has happened. However, I am still none the wiser as to the state of my car. I would appreciate more information as to where the fire started based on a map view, maybe with a plan of row letters etc so I can estimate the likelihood of the level of damage to my car. I am expecting the worst. She said she regularly uses her car to transport her two children, but added that Luton Airport has been good at communicating with her about updates. I can only imagine they are operating in crisis mode behind the scenes, she said. They have emailed me a couple of times with updates and whilst there is little specific info around my individual vehicle, they have kept me up to date. Izabela, a 34-year-old beauty therapist in Willenhall, told PA she felt massive shock upon learning that Luton car park was on fire as she believes her car has been burnt. Izabela had boarded the plane to return from a holiday in Lanzarote with her husband Dawid when the pilot announced that there was an incident at Luton Airport and the flight had been cancelled. Izabela, who did not wish to share her surname, said we do not know nothing about our car, which contained a laptop, house keys and other items. She said the situation was a nightmare and added: Without the car, what are we supposed to do now? A London Luton Airport spokesperson said: We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car parking customers, and we recognise many are anxious for answers. We are working hard to provide those answers as quickly as possible, though this will take some time. We would like to thank our customers for their continued patience and understanding.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The woman accused Bridges of throwing billiard balls at her vehicle -- shattering the windshield and leaving dents -- during a custody exchange, according to a criminal summons issued Wednesday. The pair's children were in the car during the alleged incident. Bridges' girlfriend also yelled and kicked the vehicle while the children were inside, the summons states. Bridges, 25, allegedly told the victim that if she went to the police he would take everything from her and withhold child support, according to the document. Representatives for Bridges did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment. The incident happened on October 6, but was not reported until October 10, according to NBC affiliate WCNC of Charlotte, North Carolina. The summons accuses the NBA star of violating a domestic violence protective order, misdemeanor child abuse and injury to personal property. Bridges is expected to appear in court on November 13. There is also an arrest warrant that was issued for the basketball player on January 2. A spokesperson for the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said the warrant is not related to the criminal summons. The Hornets told the news station that it was aware of the reports and are in the process of gathering more information. The allegations come more than a year after Bridges was arrested for allegedly assaulting a girlfriend in front of their two children in June 2022. He initially pleaded not guilty, but later changed it to no contest and was sentenced to three years probation.

The money was transferred last month from a South Korean bank to a bank in Qatar. Iran could only access the money through a series of steps, including oversight by the Treasury Department, administration officials have said. Administration officials have said over the past several days that Iran has not accessed any of the money, and that the YOU.S. could re-freeze it at any time. But there was growing pressure on the White House to send a clearer message that Iran would not access the money. Critics of the White House's decision to give Iran access to the 6 billion have said the money is fungible and that any funds Iran receives, regardless of whether it is for humanitarian assistance, would free up more money for it to fund terrorism.

A weak macroeconomic environment, geopolitical risks and a growing sense of uncertainty have dominated discussions this year. China's economic slowdown, fears of a higher-for-longer interest rates environment, weak global manufacturing and looming supply surpluses amid rising LME inventories remain the key risks ahead. China's real estate worries deepen China's official gauge of manufacturing activity only just returned to growth for the first time in six months, at 50.2, in September. However, all things related to the property market continue to struggle. Stimulus measures introduced over the last couple of months are yet to have a meaningful impact on metals demand. Additional measures might be necessary to boost demand for industrial metals. Renewed concerns over the fate of China Evergrande have surfaced following the detention of its chairman. And there are still questions looming over the economy's largest developer, Country Garden, after it warned that it might not be able to meet repayments on offshore debt. A slump in China's property market has been a major headwind to metals demand this year, with the LMEX Index of six metals down around 10 this year. During Golden Week in early October, which is typically a prime time for property developers, home sales declined from last year. A continued slowdown in China's property sector remains the main threat to metals demand looking ahead. We believe the short-term outlook remains bearish for metals demand and we do not foresee a substantial recovery before next year. Metals prices should continue to trade under pressure in the fourth quarter with the only upside risk being if Chinese demand recovers faster than anticipated. Prices are likely to remain volatile through the quarter as markets will continue to react to macro drivers. US consumer price inflation for September rose slightly faster than the consensus forecast, pushing the dollar and Treasury yields higher. Meanwhile, US payrolls surged in September, underscoring the strength seen in economic activity over the summer backing the Fed's argument on the need for interest rates to stay higher for longer. The market pricing around the possibility of a rate hike by December has increased marginally, but our US economist doubts it will happen. Fed officials have been emphasising the importance of the increase in Treasury yields as a factor that will tighten financial conditions and reduce the need for another rate hike. Our US economist believes that monetary policy is restrictive enough and does not think that the Fed will hike again. Elevated rates have been a drag on industrial metals consumption. Looking forward to 2023 and further into 2024, the possibility of US Fed continuing to raise rates and other major economies continuing with monetary tightening, remains the key uncertainty for metals markets. If US rates stay higher for longer, this would lead to a stronger US dollar and weaker investor sentiment, which in turn would translate to lower metals prices. Weak demand for industrial metals amid China's slow economic recovery and a slowdown in manufacturing globally is translating into rising inventories in LME-registered warehouses, the market of last resort. However, they remain low by historical standards. We believe low inventories fuel the possibility for spot prices to rise rapidly if consumption picks up sooner than expected. For copper, global LME stocks now stand at 179,675 tonnes as of 11 October, up more than 100 from 88,550 tonnes at the start of 2023, and the highest it has been since October 2021. LME copper stocks have been rising for the past few months and have more than tripled since July. For zinc, LME warehouse stocks have risen to 89,050 tonnes, up more than 190 from 30,475 tonnes in January. Zinc inventories reached their peak this year at the end of August at 153,975 tonnes. Aluminium stocks in LME warehouses have also been rising. They are currently at 492,650 tonnes, up 10 from 447,250 tonnes at the beginning of the year. And as LME inventories continue to rise, a lack of brand variety is adding to concerns for the aluminium market. About 76 of aluminium in the LME's warehouses was of Russian origin at the end of September, up from less than 10 before the start of the war in Ukraine. This is the highest level for at least a decade. However, the share of the Russian metal declined from 81 at the end of August. India is the other major source of LME aluminium stocks.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Scientists think they know why.,"A dead Gray Whale on the beach at Limantour Beach in Point Reyes Station, Calif., in 2019.Justin Sullivan  Getty Images file More than 680 gray whales have washed up or been found dead on North America's Pacific shores over the last four years, a rapid die-off that has puzzled and frightened scientists. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which publishes data on whales found dead, classified the spike in gray whale strandings as an unusual mortality event. So researchers began to probe the mystery: Were the massive mammals being hit by ships, tangled in fishing gear or stricken with disease? A new study, published Thursday in the journal Science, offers an answer: Changes to sea ice conditions in the Arctic appear to be causing gray whale populations to boom and bust based on shifting access to the tiny shrimplike creatures they eat. We have kind of cracked the case of these big die-offs, and we have found they happen more frequently than we expected, said Josh Stewart, an assistant professor at Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute and a lead author of the paper. Stewart's team found that the whales' population appears linked to the length of time that sea ice blocks their access to feeding grounds in the Arctic and to the quality of food available when the whales are there. It comes down to how much food do they have and how long do they have to eat, Stewart said. Climate change has played a role recently -- the extent of Arctic sea ice varies widely year to year, but rising temperatures are causing a long-term decline. Initially, that decline opened more days of access to feeding grounds for gray whales. But Arctic warming has also set off a slew of other changes -- to currents, water temperature and sea ice algae -- that have reduced the quality of the whales' food. They are not making as good a living, Stewart said. The new study offers evidence that sea ice variability was also behind two prior gray whale mass death events, including a well-documented die-off that began in the late 1990s. The findings suggest, as well, that climate change could limit the number of gray whales that can survive in the future, as diminishing sea ice impacts the population of tiny, seafloor-dwelling crustaceans the whales love to eat. Most North Pacific gray whales migrate more than 5,000 miles twice a year, spending their winters in warm lagoons off Mexico, where they can safely raise calves and reproduce, then feasting in the Arctic during the summer. In those Arctic feeding grounds, gray whales dive to the bottom of shallow basins, suck up sediment filled with crustaceans called amphipods, and then filter out the food from the mud. The enormous creatures -- which can reach nearly 50 feet in length, weigh about 90,000 pounds and have been documented living as long as 80 years -- spend only about four months feeding, Stewart said. The rest of the year, they mostly fast. They really have to gorge themselves for those four months, Stewart said. For the new study, Stewart's team analyzed data from long-term monitoring programs to evaluate whales' abundance, reproduction, deaths and body condition over the past 50 years. From those numbers, it was clear that gray whale populations have had periodic booms and busts. The scientists then compared that data to the animals' level of access to their feeding grounds and the abundance of crustaceans, finding a pattern. Researchers have long suspected that Arctic conditions could be impacting gray whales, and past studies have investigated whether the availability of prey could play a role in die-offs. The new findings show convincingly that there is a relationship between ice cover and variability in gray whale populations, said Elliott Hazen, a research ecologist at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center, who was not involved in the new study. We have a clearer idea of what happened, Hazen said. Once ravaged by 19th and 20th-century commercial whaling, North Pacific gray whales became a beacon of conservation success after the 1960s, as federal protections and international whaling restrictions led their population to boom. The species is protected by the YOU.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and the International Whaling Commission. Since the height of the whaling industry, when gray whale blubber was used for oil, the animals have made a remarkable recovery. Gray whales have been one of our quickest rebounding populations, Hazan said. But in 1999, hundreds of whales began washing up dead on beaches in the YOU.S., Mexico and Canada. Scientists knew many more were dying away from human view. For every whale that washes up dead, there are 20 that die that do not wash up, Stewart said. When the same pattern played out again two decades later, scientists began to dive deeper. The new study puts the recent rash of deaths into context and highlights the threats the species faces going forward. The North Pacific gray whale population had surged to about 27,000 by 2016, according to NOAA estimates; today, that number is closer to 14,500. Stewart said he is not worried that gray whales will go extinct. The mammals have persisted through ice ages, periods of warming and tens of thousands of years of changes to their prey -- not to mention a period of extensive human hunting. They have lived through major climatic change in the past. They are quite adaptable, Stewart said. But Arctic warning is now a major problem for the whales, one that Stewart said could ultimately limit the number of mammals sustained by the feeding grounds. That is a tough thing to swallow, Stewart said. We have locked in changes that may have altered how many whales they can fundamentally support.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Department of Justice's decision, first reported by The Intercept, came after a criminal investigation found agents' use of force under the facts and circumstances presented in this case does not rise to the level of a federal criminal civil rights violation or a criminal violation assimilated under Arizona law, Zachry Stoebe, public affairs officer with the YOU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona, said in a statement. Body-cam footage released by YOU.S. Customs and Border Protection in June appeared to show Mattia, who was unarmed, reaching into his jacket and removing his hand quickly, immediately before agents fired on him.

But an attorney for Mattia's family said the officials present shared no substantial information from their investigation and would not answer basic questions from the family. The family is looking for answers and justice, Ryan Stitt, the San Diego-based attorney representing the family, told the Arizona Daily Star on Thursday. The family will likely file a civil lawsuit to get answers about what happened that night, he said. In particular, the family wants to know the agency affiliation of all officers who opened fire on Mattia, as officers from both Border Patrol and the Tohono O'odham tribal police department were on site. Customs and Border Protection said in a June press release that three Border Patrol agents fired on Mattia, out of 10 agents who were present, and that there was one tribal policeman on duty in the area that night. During the September meeting, Mattia's family asked DOJ employees if tribal police also fired at Mattia. In response, they said it was not the appropriate time to do civil discovery, a legal term related to information you would get as part of a civil lawsuit, Stitt said. That response suggested to the family that DOJ officials were looking to protect themselves against this forthcoming lawsuit, instead of answering the family's questions about who the shooters were, what they said and what the independent investigation shows, and why charges are not going to be filed, Stitt said. The family has a clear right to that information. On Thursday the Star asked Stoebe, of the YOU.S. Attorney's Office's Arizona district, whether any tribal police members also fired on Mattia. Stoebe said a Freedom of Information Act request is necessary to get that information, which the Star filed on October 12. The lack of transparency from the YOU.S. Attorney's Office is really disappointing and upsetting to the family, Stitt said. It compounds their grief and the injury that they have suffered. Night of the shooting Mattia, 58, lived near the YOU.S.-Mexico border in a remote Tohono O'odham village called Menagers Dam, about 140 miles southwest of Tucson. Mattia's family said on May 18, the night he was killed, Mattia had called law enforcement to report border-crossers on his property. Raymond called for help and, in turn, was shot down at his doorstep, the family said in a statement at the time. In our eyes and hearts, we believe that Raymond was approached with excessive and deadly force that took his life. CBP said Ajo Border Patrol Station agents responded to a request for assistance from the Tohono O'odham Nation Police Department around 9 p.m., after receiving a report of gunfire in the area. Agents met a tribal police officer at a local recreation center and followed the officer by car, then on foot, to an area near Mattia's home. The body-cam footage CBP released in June shows Mattia illuminated by agents' search lights in front of his home. A few moments later, the video shows Mattia throwing an object toward the officers, which lands at their feet, after agents ordered him to put down what he was carrying. Agents later learned that it was a machete still in its sheath. Mattia, who was unarmed at that point, then appears to reach into his jacket and agents yell, Put your hands out of your (expletive) pocket! As Mattia quickly pulls out his hand, a volley of gunfire immediately follows and Mattia falls face down on the ground. According to the autopsy report, agents' bullets struck Mattia's torso five times and his extremities another five times. Afterwards agents approach and begin life-saving efforts, including CPR, the video shows. He was pronounced dead at 10:06 p.m. The autopsy report showed Mattia had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system. According to the toxicology report from the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office, Mattia had a high enough level of methamphetamine to cause intoxication, and a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit for driving. Mattia's family and supporters have decried the shooting, saying it shows how a militarized border region has damaged the tribe, whose ancestral lands encompass terrain on both sides of the border with Mexico. Mattia was a father, uncle, brother, friend, and an involved community member, the family's May statement said. Raymond always fought for what was right, and he will continue to fight even after his death. This is not an isolated incident, but it should bring awareness of the oppression our people live through. Contact reporter Emily Bregel at ebregeltucson.com. On X, formerly Twitter: EmilyBregel Statement from YOU.S. Attorney's Office Department of Justice employees, including supervisory and line Assistant YOU.S. Attorneys, a victim advocate and an FBI agent, met with Mr. Mattia's family and the family's lawyers in Sells on September 19 for more than an hour. The employees explained our conclusion in the criminal investigation - that the agents' use of force under the facts and circumstances presented in this case does not rise to the level of a federal criminal civil rights violation or a criminal violation assimilated under Arizona law -- and addressed questions posed by the family and the lawyers. We decline to comment more specifically on the meeting between the family and the Department employees: victims have an inherent right to speak with the press, and to criticize their government.

Bess called in sick on the day that a horrific fire tore through the garment factory. Celia died, along with 144 others. The tragedy transformed YOU.S. labor law and the building that housed the factory, now a New York University science building, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003. But until this week, there had never been a permanent memorial paying tribute to the fire's victims. One was unveiled Wednesday at the site of the factory on the corner of Washington Place and Green Street near Washington Square Park. The memorial was conceived by the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition, a nonprofit group of descendants and labor advocates dedicated to preserving the memory of the mostly Jewish and Italian immigrant women who died that day and the fire's impact on the organized labor movement.

Please accept the JTA Privacy Policy By submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org It is remarkable to see people showing up who maybe did not have a connection but who feel moved by it, said Allison Kestenbaum, who brought her two children to the unveiling from their home in San Diego. This triggers emotions for a lot of people and opens our eyes to something that so many did not know anything about. According to the story that is been passed down through in the Kestenbaum family, Bess called in sick on March 25, 1911, a warm Saturday. Her sister, Celia, just 17, went to work without her. Near the end of the workday, a cigarette butt ignited fabric scraps inside the factory, on the ninth floor of the Asch Building. As the flames began to spread, the women who worked there found that they had been locked in from the outside by management, who wanted to prevent the workers, who made roughly 7 a week, from stealing inventory as well as keep out union organizers. The fire was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in New York City history. The memorial, in the making for more than a decade, includes a massive stainless steel ribbon that floats horizontally along the edge of the building -- the names and ages of the victims are cut out of the ribbon. A stone panel underneath the ribbon reflects the names back to the viewers and also bears quotes from witness and survivor testimonies. On Wednesday, the reflective stone panel was also adorned with 146 white roses in honor of the victims. Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke at the unveiling ceremony of a memorial for the 146 victimes of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, October 12, 2023. (Office of Governor Kathy Hochul) It is getting some really beautiful reactions, Uri Wegman, who, along with Richard Joon Yoo, was one of the two architects of the memorial, told the New York Jewish Week. You never know how people are going to respond and I feel like we are accomplishing exactly what we designed the memorial to do, to transport and reorient people to the events of the tragedy, the Israeli-born architect said. Over the next few months, a vertical steel column will be installed to showcase the height from which workers jumped in a futile attempt to escape the flames. The Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organizes an annual event on the anniversary of the fire, in partnership with Workers United, the New York City Central Labor Council, the FDNY and New York University. I have waited a really long time to say three words to you -- three powerful words, and three extraordinarily sweet words: We did it, said Mary Anne Trasciatti, the president of the coalition, at Wednesday's unveiling ceremony. By honoring the Triangle workers with this memorial, we are making a statement about the dignity and humanity of every worker, past and present. We are showing our support for baristas, auto workers, nurses, teachers, farm workers, warehouse workers, coal miners.

Donate Unions from around the city and beyond -- including the International Ladies Garment Workers, the Steamfitters Union, the Laborer's International Union, Actor's Equity, United Automobile Workers and the SAG-AFTRA Union -- sent representatives to the unveiling ceremony. At the ceremony, labor organizers reminded the crowd about how the fire jumpstarted labor reforms and workers' rights efforts, including activism and legislation that led to safety protocols, workers' compensation, a 40-hour work week, minimum wage and pensions. They also used the opportunity to speak about workers' rights today, pledging continuing support for the Hollywood actors' and United Auto Workers strikes. Hundreds of people, including descendants of victims, union members, local officials and labor activists came to the unveiling of the memorial, October 11, 2023. (Julia Gergely) The Triangle fire -- with its large number of Jewish, Eastern European immigrant victims -- also galvanized the Jewish community, which had an already active labor base, Ann Toback, the chief executive officer of the Worker's Circle, told the New York Jewish Week. Founded in 1900 as a fraternal organization to help Eastern European immigrants adjust to American society and workplaces, the Workers Circle was a central base for Jewish labor activists and in 1909 helped organize a general strike in the shirtwaist industry that lasted 11 weeks and which consisted of 20,000 young Jewish women. One of the only holdouts of the strike was the Triangle company. After the tragedy in 1911, Jewish union organizers Clara Lemlich and Rose Schneiderman marched from the site of the tragedy to Cooper Square to demand new changes and more organizing. It did spark a new outcry of activism and The Workers Circle at that time was very much a center of labor activism, Toback said. Jewish labor activists and Workers Circle members were also at the forefront of expanding the membership and organizing power of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, which became one of the country's largest labor unions after the fire. The Workers Circle also helped sponsor the memorial. In remarks, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul shared that her grandfather, uncles and father worked in coke ovens at the Bethlehem Steel plant, itself the site of multiple fatal industrial accidents. I am so proud to be part of this effort to honor the names of those who were lost in that horrific inferno, Hochul said. She called New York the birthplace of the workers' rights movement because of what happened right on this block. New York State allocated 1.5 million in state funds to build the memorial. A steel ribbon with cutouts of the names of the victims wraps around the former site of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Street. (Julia Gergely) Hochul, who has been trying to maintain support for immigrants as the city struggles with the recent influx of nearly 125,000 migrants, connected the fire to the present day. Our workers deserve to be protected and we will fight to make sure they have those rights, Hochul said. This state is so great because of the immigrants, the migrants who came here. Let them work. We need them. Julie Su, the Acting YOU.S. Secretary of Labor, also addressed the crowd. We can imagine the black plume of smoke up in the air, the flames that spread from floor to floor, the panic of the workers who ran and found closed exits and broken fire escapes, she said. Their cries for help and then the thud of bodies as they began to jump one after another. Allison Kestenbaum said she has always felt a strong connection to her relative and other victims of the fire. I went to NYU. If I had been there two generations earlier, an immigrant, I would not have had the opportunity to go to college -- I would have been a seamstress in a sweatshop, she said.

The YOU.S., other G7 countries and Australia imposed the cap last year, seeking to reduce Russia's revenues from seaborne oil exports as part of sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine. The cap bans Western companies from providing maritime services, including insurance, finance and shipping, for Russian seaborne oil exports sold above 60 a barrel, while seeking to keep oil flowing to markets. Caps also were imposed on Russian fuel exports. YOU.S. President Joe Biden's administration placed sanctions on Turkey-based Ice Pearl Navigation SA, owner of the Yasa Golden Bosphorus, which the Treasury said carried Russian ESPO crude priced above 80 a barrel after the cap took effect in December last year. The YOU.S. also imposed sanctions on UAE-based Lumber Marine SA, owner of the SCF Primorye, which the Treasury said was carrying Novy Port Russian crude above 75 per barrel. Both tankers, which conducted port calls in Russia, used YOU.S.-based service providers while transporting the Russian origin oil, the Treasury said. Because of the actions we are announcing today, and the further actions we will take in the coming weeks and months, these costs will continue to rise and Russia's ability to sustain its barbaric war will continue to weaken, a senior Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters in a call. Turkey's Yasa Holding, operator of the Golden Bosphorus, said the vessel is currently under time-charter for 3-5 months with Exxon Mobil XOM.N. The YOU.S. oil major was not immediately available for comment. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any involvement by Exxon. Yasa added the company had necessary documentation from major London insurers for it to carry Russian origin cargoes and that it has been company policy for more than a year to not carry Russian crude. Global oil prices have risen to around 85 a barrel in recent months on production cuts and thin world spare production capacity. That has helped to limit the efficacy of the cap, but actions to toughen enforcement will make it more effective, according to people who advised the Treasury. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday that preliminary estimates showed Russian crude oil exports last month stood at 4.9 million bpd, down about 100,000 barrels per day from the May-June average. But it also said Russia's total exports of crude oil and products in September rose by 460,000 bpd to 7.6 million bpd, with crude accounting for 250,000 bpd of the increase. The cap has forced Russia and traders who want to participate in the Russian oil trade to invest in what the industry refers to as a ghost fleet of old tankers vulnerable to leaks and oil spills. Those vessels are undertaking long voyages to deliver crude to refiners in China and India, which have become the largest buyers of Russian crude. Neither country has imposed sanctions on trade with Russia. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said on the Telegram messaging app that the new sanctions were the result of an international working group he helped create and that violations of the Russian oil price cap will be punished. The YOU.S. Treasury official said the cap forces Russia to pay about 36 a barrel for those non-Western maritime services, expenses that go to tankers not tanks reducing its revenues for use in the Ukraine war. YOU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday said the price cap had sharply reduced Russian revenues over the past 10 months, and that it was critical to keep imposing severe and increasing costs on Russia over its war in Ukraine. Just before the YOU.S. sanctions were announced, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters at IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Marrakech, Morocco, that the cap has been efficient in reducing Russia's revenues but that there are loopholes. We have to address that question, to fix that question and to have an efficient enforcement of the oil cap.

The United Auto Workers strike finally began to take its toll on the Automotive MMI (Monthly Metals Index) as well as month-over-month steel prices. Regarding price drops, hot-dipped galvanized managed to suffer the most. And with the strike continuing to escalate, negotiations stagnating, and more and more layoffs occurring nationwide, the index faces massive bearish pressure in the immediate future. Overall, the Automotive MMI dropped by 4.51 Jeep manufacturer Stellantis announced that it has laid off more than 500 employees at the Trenton Engine Complex, as well as a smaller number of workers in Indiana. The UAW strike, which led to storage difficulties and a lack of parts, proved the primary reason for the layoff decision. At the moment, 640 Stellantis employees are currently on temporary release due to the strike. Other automakers have also witnessed impacts from the UAW's ongoing protest. Due to the strike at the Chicago Assembly Plant, Ford requested that 71 employees of the Livonia Transmission Plant not report to work on Monday, October 9. Like Stellantis, Ford also experienced a scarcity of parts due to the strike. Ultimately, General Motors (GM) had to idle an assembly plant in Kansas, resulting in the layoff of around 2,000 workers. Economic analysts estimate that the UAW strike has thus far cost the automotive sector 5.5 billion. Indeed, nearly 13,000 GM, Ford, and Stellantis employees took to picket lines over the past four weeks. The UAW has since criticized the Big Three automakers' decisions to fire workers, with union leader Shawn Fain claiming that the Big Three are using the layoffs as a strategy to put the squeeze on our members to settle for less. Ultimately, the strike continues to lower demand for auto steel, adding bearish pressure to already falling steel prices. Indeed, auto companies produced 6,030 fewer vehicles per day due to the UAW strike's effects. The cost of the UAW strike reflects the 16 days that production was halted at one assembly facility in Wentzville, Missouri, which produces mid-size pickups. Because of the strike, Ford has had to let go of around 930 employees. Meanwhile, Stellantis released at least 370 employees in Ohio and Indiana. That said, it is possible that the strike may eventually reduce steel availability and raise steel prices, though only time will tell. After overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year deal, thousands of unionized workers at Mack Trucks went on strike. According to the United Auto Workers (UAW), 73 of its members voted against the proposed agreement. The deal apparently included a 19 pay increase, a 3,500 ratification bonus, improved retirement benefits, additional vacation time for some employees, and a shorter time to reach top pay. About 4,000 Mack employees represent the UAW in three separate states. According to UAW President Shawn Fain, several issues still need to be resolved, including clauses relating to salary, work schedules, benefits, and health and safety. The latest strike is distinct from the UAW disagreement with Detroit's Big Three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, as Mack Trucks belongs to Volvo. Since September 15, the UAW has been striking specifically against the Detroit Three automakers' facilities, with around 25,000 of the 146,000 UAW workers participating. Ford agreed to enhance its salary increase to 23 over four years, potentially raising expectations for union members at Mack due to recent developments in their own negotiations. The Mack arrangement also included an immediate 10 pay hike and nine more percentage points of compensation increases over the course of the five-year contract. When the UAW decided to strike, Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said that the firm was surprised and disappointed, and that the action proved needless. In the past year, workers at FedEx and in the freight rail industry rejected tentative deals before later agreeing.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. Dating can consist of great communication, spotty here-and-there texts or even ghosting -- in which people ignore each other to end a relationship. Now comes a study about female frogs -- and revelations about how the amphibians take ghosting to the next level in their world by playing dead to avoid unwanted male interactions. A recent study published in The Royal Society Open Science journal focused on male and female European common frogs to see whether the females avoided the males in different situations. GHOST RAINBOWS, 'RAINING FROGS' AND SUN HALOS: WEIRD WEATHER PHENOMENA SEEN ACROSS THE US The researchers tested various avoidance behaviors by the female frogs -- including rotating, release calls and tonic immobility, according to The Royal Society. Rotating was defined as a female starting to rotate around her own body axis when amplexed by a male. Amplexus is defined as the mating embrace of some amphibians, according to Merriam-Webster. AMERICA'S ODDEST LAWS INCLUDE RULES AGAINST DRESSING AS NUNS, EATING FROGS AND MORE Release calls were defined as when the female is amplexed by the male, and she begins to call -- making a certain noise. Tonic immobility is the stiffening of a female: The frog will stretch out her arms and legs and act as if she is dead. The researchers found that rotating was the most common method of avoidance by the 54 females studied -- with 83 of them using that avoidance method, according to the study. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Release calls were done by 48 of the females -- and were always associated with rotating as well. The study also found that tonic immobility, or playing dead, occurred among 33 of the female frogs in combination with both rotating and calling. It was also determined that a smaller female frog size was associated with all three tactics, as the study reported. Researchers began the study in 2019 when they collected the frogs. The research was part of the Natural History Museum Berlin. The study indicated that male frogs may harass, coerce or intimidate females into mating.

Ron DeSantis on Wednesday night took aim at former President Donald Trump after he described Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group that has been exchanging fire across the border with Israel since Hamas launched its surprise attack on the country last weekend, as very smart. In remarks at a Club 47 event in West Palm Beach on Wednesday night, Trump blamed President Joe Biden for the deadly ongoing Israel-Hamas war by baselessly claiming that the Biden administration funded the attacks with the 6 billion in oil revenue it recently unfroze as a result of a prisoner exchange with Iran, which has historically funded Hamas. And then two nights ago, I read all of Biden security people -- can you imagine National Defense people and they said 'gee, I hope Hezbollah does not attack from the north because that is the most vulnerable spot,' Trump said. I said, 'Wait a minute,' You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They are all very smart. Trump also went after DeSantis in his speech, saying that the Florida governor has been flying around the country setting fire to his reputation and destroying the reputation frankly of Florida. DeSantis swiftly knocked Trump in a post to X that included a video of the former president's remarks: Terrorists have murdered at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans and are holding more hostage, so it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as 'very smart. As President, I will stand with Israel and treat terrorists like the scum that they are, he added. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DeSantis has sharpened his critiques against Trump in recent days, arguing that Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House in 2024 if Trump wins the GOP presidential nomination during an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday. I think a referendum on Joe Biden means we win, if I am the candidate. I think a referendum on Donald Trump, if that is it, then I think the Democrats would win, DeSantis said on Morning Joe. He said although there are millions of voters who disapprove of Biden, believe the country is heading in the wrong direction and want to vote for a Republican, Trump is just a dealbreaker for them. They just will not do it. Since Hamas launched its attacks against Israel last weekend, Republican 2024 presidential candidates have blamed the Biden administration for the attacks that have prompted an ongoing war. Several of the contenders have insisted, without evidence, that the YOU.S. funded the attacks as a result of the prisoner exchange deal with Iran. Biden has repeatedly stressed his administration's support for Israel amid its war with Hamas and efforts to free American hostages this week. His administration has also pushed back against the GOP criticism, insisting that the 6 billion in oil revenue that Iran recently regained access to did not come from YOU.S. taxpayer dollars. All of the money held in restricted accounts in Doha as part of the arrangement to secure the release of 5 Americans in September remains in Doha. Not a penny has been spent, Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson tweeted, referring to the Qatari banks holding the funds. These restricted funds cannot go to Iran -- it can only be used for future humanitarian-related purposes. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and misleading. Israel has launched airstrikes into the Gaza Strip and Hamas has fired rockets toward Tel Aviv as the war stretches into its sixth day. Israel's military said it is preparing for a possible ground operation in Gaza, a densely populated strip that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, half of whom are children. The IDF's preparations come after Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed a wartime unity cabinet and vowed to crush and destroy Hamas.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Follow live updates","JERUSALEM -- Palestinians lined up outside bakeries and grocery stores in Gaza on Thursday after spending the night surrounded by the ruins of pulverized neighborhoods darkened by a near-total power outage. Israel launched new airstrikes and said it was preparing for a possible ground invasion. International aid groups warned that the death toll in Gaza could mount after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity and the tiny enclave's crossing with Egypt is closed. The war -- which was ignited by a bloody and wide-ranging assault on Israel by Hamas militants -- has already claimed at least 2,600 lives on both sides. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces are preparing for a ground maneuver should political leaders order one. A ground offensive in Gaza, whose 2.3 million residents are densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.

After Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people in their homes, on the streets and at an outdoor music festival, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to crush the group, which has governed Gaza since 2007. The Israeli government is under intense public pressure to topple the militant group rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza after four previous conflicts ended with Hamas still firmly in charge of the territory. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities. The YOU.S. has also pledged unwavering support, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday to meet with Israeli leaders. He plans to meet Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority is confined to the occupied West Bank, and Jordan's King Abdullah II. You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourselves, but as long as America exists you will never have to, Blinken said after meeting with Netanyahu. We will always be there by your side.

A Government report into car park fires published in 2010 found that sprinklers do help extinguish such blazes and 'clearly assist in reducing structural damage'. But they were never made compulsory - and a fire safety expert has now insisted sprinklers or drenchers should be 'mandated and fitted in all multi-storey car parks'. A 600C (1,100F) blaze at the 20million Terminal Car Park 2 which broke out at about 9pm on Tuesday is thought to have been started by a diesel Range Rover, which investigators believe could have suffered an electrical fault or a leaking fuel line. Firefighters suggested the blaze then spread as a number of electric vehicles burst into flames in a domino effect - with crews in Bedfordshire working for 12 hours through the night and into yesterday morning to extinguish the fire by about 9am. Burnt cars can be seen inside the London Luton Airport Terminal Car Park 2 which collapsed The remains of London Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 today following the collapse Burnt vehicles at Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 following the fire on Tuesday night But Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service chief fire officer Andrew Hopkinson said there did not appear to be any sprinklers in the car park, adding that these 'may have made a positive impact on this incident'. READ MORE I parked my car at Luton airport - I am unlikely to get access to it for WEEKS... if at all: Despair grows after 20m car park collapsed in huge inferno sparked by Range Rover which set on fire Advertisement He also urged the airport to install them in existing and future car parks - and said the open sides of the structure, which was only opened in 2019, meant the fire likely spread 'horizontally' before it tore upwards through the building. Now, fire investigator Peter Mansi, a former borough commander in the London Fire Brigade, has called for sprinklers to be mandatory in car parks. He told MailOnline: 'Due to the low level ceilings in these multi-story car parks and the closeness of parked vehicles, any vehicle fire, whether diesel, petrol or electric, will spread to adjacent vehicles quickly. 'The fire plume impinges on the typically low ceiling and spreads laterally very quickly, radiating heat from the ceiling level onto vehicles that may be one or two car bays away from the fire vehicle. 'Sprinklers or drenchers should be mandated and fitted in all multi story car parks to contain a fire until the fire service arrives.' The Luton blaze came nearly six years after a huge fire destroyed up to 1,600 vehicles in a Liverpool car park in December 2017, which firefighters said at the time could have been stopped if sprinklers had been fitted in the building. Also today, a firefighting source passed a Government report published in 2010 to MailOnline, which found evidence that sprinklers stopped car park fires from spreading. The paper was commissioned by the then-Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) in 2006, which was over a decade before the Liverpool car park fire. Up to 1,200 vehicles were affected by the fire and collapse of the car park at Luton Airport Flights at Luton Airport were suspended following the blaze which broke out at about 9pm On sprinklers, it concludes: 'The effectiveness of sprinklers in limiting a fire to a single car has been demonstrated. This supports findings reported verbally by the fire and rescue service. Sprinklers clearly assist in reducing structural damage. READ MORE Luton Airport's 20 million multi-storey car park engulfed in a massive fire did not have any sprinklers despite only opening in 2019 - and now 'will probably have to be demolished' Advertisement 'With regards to fire fighting these benefits need to be assessed in relation to cooling and downdrag. The design parameters for fire suppression of stackers need to be developed.' The report also analysed nine tests carried out involving 20 cars which looked at fire development in closed car parks. The aim was to establish the effect of a fire started in one car in a closed car park - with a ventilation system operating, the sprinkler system operated and then neither system operated. The tests investigated the chances of fire spreading to multiple cars, the temperatures reached in the air and the structural impact. The tests found that the sprinkler system was 'effective at controlling a developing fire' and 'equally as effective at controlling a fully developed fire'. It added that 'without sprinklers fire is likely to spread from car to car' and 'with sprinklers spread of fire is unlikely'. The report also found that structurally, the steelwork was not affected until 30 minutes of fire exposure - and with sprinklers there, the 'steelwork remained unaffected for the duration of the test'. MailOnline has contacted the relevant department - which is now the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government - to comment on why the Government did not implement a mandatory sprinklers rule for car parks, despite the report 13 years ago stating their importance in mitigating fires.

READ MORE Revealed: Company which built 20m Luton airport car park destroyed by inferno went BUST last month - and had also been working on Liverpool and Fulham's football stadiums Advertisement He added that diesel is 'much less flammable' than petrol, and in a car it takes 'intense pressure or sustained flame' to ignite diesel. And Alastair Soane, principal consultant for Collaborative Reporting for Safer Structures UK (Cross UK), a confidential industry reporting system, said: 'Fires in car parks are not uncommon, but a fire of this magnitude is rare. 'A full investigation will be required to understand what has happened. We do not yet know the reasons for this fire and structural damage to this multi-storey car park.' Fire chief Mr Hopkinson confirmed to reporters at the scene in Luton yesterday that there were no sprinklers in the car park. He said: 'We are already talking to the airport about ensuring that any future, and the existing, car parks have sprinklers fitted because this building is not sprinkler protected. Sprinklers may have made a positive impact on this incident.' There is no suggestion the blaze happened intentionally. After the Liverpool fire in 2017, Dan Stephens of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said crews would have had a 'much better' chance of stopping the fire had sprinklers been installed.

MailOnline contacted its administrators Grant Thornton, but they declined to comment. Also involved in the car park construction was a Lancashire-based company called Raised Floor Solutions (RFS), although it was not the builder or main contractor. RFS confirmed to MailOnline that it was employed by Buckingham to supply and install the metal-deck flooring formwork to the designs produced by a structural engineering firm called Hill Cannon which is based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

Emergency responders declared the situation a major incident, which sparked disruption for tens of thousands of passengers booked to leave or arrive on flights at the air hub in Bedfordshire, north of the British capital. The runway is now open, and flights are beginning to arrive and depart, the airport said in an update, noting all main roads around the area had also reopened but that delays were expected accessing the site. It urged passengers to contact their airlines for further information about their flights. Firefighters had worked through the night into Wednesday to extinguish the blaze, which erupted Tuesday at 8:47 pm (1947 GMT) on level three of the airport's newly built car park at Terminal 2. Flames could be seen leaping out of the third floor Tuesday night, according to an AFP photographer at the scene. Three firefighters and a member of airport staff were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, and another firefighter was treated at the scene. Another person was treated on site.

Our first two fire appliances arrived on scene just a shade under 10 minutes later to work alongside firefighters from Luton Airport Fire Service, said Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. On arrival my officers were faced with a severe and rapidly spreading fire involving a large number of vehicles that ultimately spread to multiple floors and involved a partial collapse of the car park, he added. Up to 1,500 vehicles were believed to have been in the car park at the time. Firefighting operations were still underway to dampen down the area, the service had said early Wednesday. At the peak of the blaze, there were 15 rescue pumps, three aerial vehicles and over 100 firefighters on scene at this incident. A full fire investigation will take place, it added. Hopkinson said there were no sprinklers in the car park and that we are already talking to the airport about ensuring that any future, and the existing, car parks have sprinklers fitted. About 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of central London, Luton is served by several budget carriers and is one of six major airports serving the British capital.

The ministry said 667,000 tons of grain were exported in the first ten days of October. Ukraine exported 1.56 million tons from October 1-11 a year ago. The ministry gave no explanation for the decrease. Traders and farmers unions have said blocked Ukrainian Black Sea ports and Russian attacks on Ukrainian ports on the Danube River are the main reasons for lower exports. The exported volume included 3.8 million tons of wheat, 2.9 million tons of corn and 640,000 tons of barley. Ukraine has traditionally shipped most of its exports through its deep water Black Sea ports. A deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey allowing such exports collapsed in July when Russia withdrew, saying its demand that sanctions be lifted on its grain and fertiliser exports had not been met. Ukraine's military said 17 cargo vessels had entered a fledgling Black Sea shipping corridor as Kyiv steps up a push to defy the de-facto Russian blockade. Ukraine can also export limited volumes through small river ports on the Danube and via its western land border with the European Union.

Give the devil his due, the saying goes. When it comes to weapons innovation, no other evil entity - with the possible exception of the Soviet Union aka The Evil Empire - embodied this saying quite like Nazi Germany. In aerial warfare, the Third Reich's weaponry geniuses came up with the Wunderwaffen (Wonder Weapons) such world's first jet fighter, jet bomber, and rocket-powered fighter, that being the Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe, Arado Ar 234 Blitz, and Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet respectively, not to mention the first cruise missile long-range guided ballistic missile in the respective forms of the V-1 and V-2 rockets. Meanwhile, at the level of the ground fighters, Nazi Germany's war machine produced some historically significant guns for good measure. For one thing, there was the first assault rifle, the Sturmgewehr Stg-44. And then there was the subject of this article, the world's first general purpose machine gun (GPMG), the MG 34 7.92x57mm Mauser machine gun. In layman's terms, a GPMG is an air-cooled, fully automatic weapon that can be adapted to light machine gun (LMG) and medium machine gun (MMG) roles. It will typically feature a quick-change barrel, configuration for mounting on bipods, tripods, and vehicles as infantry support weapons, and chambered to fire full-powered rifle cartridges; for example, the MG 34's 7.92x57mm round is the same one used by the famed K98k Mauser infantry rifle (though it is ofttimes referred to as an 8mm for brevity). The German equivalent term for GPMG is Einheitsmaschinengewehr (Universal Machine Gun). Masterminded by small arms designer Heinrich Volmer (1885-1961), the MG (Maschinengewehr) 34 was initially designed in 1934 - hence the digital portion of the alphanumeric designation - and officially adopted into operational service with the Wehrmacht in 1936. The gun was recoil-operated and fired from an open rotating bolt. Specifications included an empty weight of 26.7 pounds, a weight of 70 pounds while mounted on a tripod, a barrel length of 24.7 inches, and an overall length of 48 inches. As far as the rate of fire is concerned, Jim Davis of GunMag Warehouse notes that the early models were capable of firing either 600 or 1,000 rounds per minute. Later, the rate of fire was fixed at the rate of 800-900 rounds per minute. Other models, which were typically used on aircraft, had higher rates of fire, some 1,200 or even 1,500 rounds per minute. Like many other Nazi weapons, such as the Tiger tank, it was way overengineered, with Will Dabbs, MD of The Armory Life describing it as a nightmare to build. Like the Tiger tank, the MG 34 had its fair share of battlefield reliability problems. Despite this, however, the MG 34 soldiered through the entirety of the Second World War, and it is safe to say that this GPMG actually ended accounting for way more Allied casualties than the main gun of the oh-so-ballyhooed Tiger. To quote Dr. Dabbs again, With the man-portable MG 34, however, a single mobile machine gun team could transport serious supporting automatic fire anyplace a man could walk. Warfare would never be the same. Indeed, speaking of WWII German tanks, they stuck with the MG 34 even after the much more reliable, user-friendly, and cost-efficient MG 42 came along. Why? Miguel Ortiz of We Are The Mighty - himself a former YOU.S. Army commissioned officer - answers that question in his February 2023 article: In short, science ... In the case of the MG 34 firing 1000 rounds per minute, the barrel would heat up fairly quickly under sustained fire ... machine guns like the MG 34 usually feature a barrel that can be swapped out quickly ... In the case of the MG 34, the barrel is replaced by rotating the receiver counter-clockwise from the barrel shroud ... On the MG 42, the barrel pops out to the right of the gun ... However, this was simply not compatible with the existing German tank designs ... Inside a tank, a gunner can easily rotate the MG 34's receiver and swap out the barrel if it gets too hot. But, because the rest of the gun is mounted in the hull or turret, the side-swapping barrel of the MG 42 would not work. The mounting designs would have to be completely reworked in order to accommodate it. Unsurprisingly, the war movies and action-adventure flicks in which the MP-40 has appeared are many in number. Just a few examples that come to mind are Raiders of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, and Escape From Sobibor. Believe it or not, International Military Antiques (I AM ABOUT TO) actually has one for sale! Granted, it is a mere display piece, but still a big-time collectible nonetheless. It is officially listed as Original German WWII MG 34 Display Machine Gun by Mauser Werke with Drum Carrier  Inert Ammo in Belt and sells for a measly 4,495.00. Oh wait, you say you actually to fire an MG 34? Well, you are still in luck, assuming you have the time and travel funds. Battlefield Vegas (in Las Vegas, Nevada, of course; where else?) has one available for rental; it will cost you 80.00 to fire off a 20-round ammo belt and 150.00 for 40 rounds, the latter being the literal and figurative more bang for your buck ... or would that be more rat-a-tat-tat for your buck in this case? So then, what if you are not interested in either owning or firing an MG 34 and are perfectly content to see the world's first GPMG in a museum? To cite just three examples, there is Britain's fantastic Imperial War Museum (IWM), as well as Greece's War Museum in Athens, and The Great White North's Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) Museum in London, Ontario.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The video is believed to have been taken just after the fire started on the third floor of the car park at Luton Airport's Terminal 2. A woman spotted the car on fire as she went to pick up relatives at the airport and started filming. She told BBC News: We saw there is a fire but the fire extinguisher from this floor was used so we went to another floor to take another. But at that moment when we came to the car it exploded and we could not come near. The explosion caused the complete closure of the airport and left tens of thousands of passengers facing disruption. All flights were stopped from taking off and landing as a result of the blaze. Whilst flights have resumed, there will be some continued disruption as a result of the fire. More than 100 firefighters attended the scene on October 10, with Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service declaring a major incident, explaining that they believed the blaze to have been accidental. Hundreds of vehicles were destroyed in the ensuing fireball, which resulted in flights being diverted to Cardiff, Manchester, and Liverpool. At the time, the chair of Luton Rising, who own the airport, Javeria Hussain told the BBC: This is a major operation and we are working extremely closely with the operator to ensure it is business as usual for the airport as quickly as possible. Disruption is likely to continue until travelling to the airport becomes normal again and passengers should check with their airline. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service issued an update yesterday morning that read: Crews have worked extremely hard throughout the night and into the early morning to control and extinguish the fire. Firefighting operations are monitoring the smouldering remains and will continue throughout the day. Currently four crews and an aerial appliance remain at the scene, and crews are working in conjunction with the airport fire service. Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson said that the blaze was likely started by a diesel-powered vehicle and the most likely because for the fire is an electrical fault with the car's 12-volt battery system. He said that because diesel is much less flammable than petrol, it would have taken 'intense pressure or sustained flame' to cause such an explosion. There will be a full investigation into what happened in due course.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

That was revealed by the company Wednesday in a securities filing. That figure, which Microsoft disputes, stems from a long-running IRS probe into how Microsoft allocated its profits among countries and jurisdictions in the years 2004 to 2013. Critics of that practice, known as transfer pricing, argue that companies use it to minimize their tax burden by reporting lower profits in high-tax countries and higher profits in lower-tax jurisdictions. Microsoft said it will appeal the decision within the IRS, a process expected to take several years. The company's shares dropped slightly in aftermarket trading, falling 1.42 to 331.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The speaker of the House is normally elected every two years, in January, when the House organizes for a new session. A new election can be held if the speaker dies, resigns or is removed from office.

Reed Wischhusen, a 32-year-old Lidl warehouse worker, is accused of possessing explosives, firearms and ammunition. Police discovered the items during a search of his home in Wick St Lawrence in November last year. While officers were at his home on Wick Road, Wischhusen attempted to take his own life in the bathroom with a pistol he had hidden in his coat, before pointing the gun at police. The armed officers shot him twice as he ran down the stairs of his home. Wischhusen then spent four months in hospital after suffering seriously injuries.

AFP UN member states must hold the Myanmar military junta accountable for Monday's massacre of dozens of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kachin State, a group of former UN experts on Myanmar demanded on Thursday. At least 29 people including 13 children were killed at the displacement camp in Mung Lai Hkyet Village in Kachin's Waingmaw Township on Monday night. The site is about 3 km north of Laiza, where the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has its headquarters. The ethnic armed group is fighting the junta. The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M) said the latest junta attack on a displacement camp could constitute a war crime. Some 100 families displaced by junta violence were taking refuge at the camp at the time of the attack. The abhorrent junta attack in Mung Lai Hyket is a result of the utter failure of the international community to act for the protection of the Myanmar people, said the SAC-M's Chris Sidoti, a former member of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFMM). Monday's attack is the deadliest junta attack on civilians in Kachin State so far this year and comes almost a year after a junta air strike on a music concert killed around 75 people in the village of A Nang Pa in the state on October 23, 2022. The junta has denied involvement and blamed an explosion at an ammonium nitrate store in a KIA training camp near the village. KIA spokesman Colonel Naw Bu told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday that the regime's account of the explosion was propaganda, saying the armed group would never position a gunpowder warehouse near civilians. Yanghee Lee of SAC-M, former UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said the Myanmar military had become so emboldened by the indifference of the international community to its decades of atrocities that it is now attacking IDP camps. The military is flagrantly massacring the most vulnerable people in society, and yet UN entities in Myanmar will not even publicly name the military as the perpetrator. At what point will the UN decide to stand with the Myanmar people? she asked. The SAC-M said the junta had escalated its campaign of brutal violence against civilians across the country this year in wilful defiance of UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2669 adopted in December 2022, which demands an immediate end to all forms of violence throughout the country. UNSC demands within resolutions are considered legally binding under international law but the resolution lacks measures that would enable the council to enforce it, the SAC-M said. Attacking a camp for displaced people is an act so utterly depraved that it defies humanity. Such depraved acts of violence are the reason the Myanmar people have been forced into a nation-defining struggle to liberate themselves entirely from the Myanmar military's influence, said the SAC-M's Marzuki Darusman, former chair of the IIFFMM. The SAC-M urged the UNSC to enforce the junta's compliance with its resolution through the imposition of a global arms embargo and targeted financial sanctions, and the referral of the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. If the Security Council will not, or cannot, act, UN member states must take action through the General Assembly and pass an urgent resolution during the current 78th session, it stated.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Shun Chi-ming, who previously worked for the Observatory, on Thursday said the suspension of rail services along open-air sections when the signal was raised on Sunday had damaged the citys image as a world-class tourist destination. The key issue lies not in whether the Observatory issued a typhoon signal No 9 on Sunday, but rather in why the MTR Corporation did not consider the actual weather conditions when deciding to suspend its services, he wrote on social media. Thousands struggled to find alternative travel when the citys sole rail operator suspended overland trains, including those for the Airport Express, only minutes after the forecaster issued the warning.Hong Kong coach boss driven to help as MTR passengers stranded in typhoon alert Shun said the practice dated back to July 23, 2012, when Typhoon Vicente hit Hong Kong and caused falling trees to damage overhead cables near Tai Po on the East Rail line. The incident left hundreds of people stranded on trains and stations overnight. It is important to note the situation that night was significantly different from what happened on Sunday. When No 9 alert was issued on July 23, 2012, Hong Kong was already experiencing widespread strong winds and gales, he explained. In contrast, the overall wind intensity on Sunday was much lower than when Typhoon Vicente hit due to the tight circulation of Typhoon Koinu, in which the strong winds only affected the offshore waters of southern Hong Kong. He also pointed to the MTR Corps decision to use anemometers, which measure wind speed and direction, for the Ngong Ping 360 cable car to help gauge when to suspend services. Similarly, Tsing Ma Bridge and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge have wind speed sensors installed to decide whether to cease operations due to high wind speeds, he said. So, why cannot the same be done for railway sections? Would it be appropriate to suspend operations for major bridges and roads in Hong Kong based solely on No 9 alert? The MTR Corp earlier said its trains generally withstood wind intensities equivalent of up to a No 8 typhoon signal, it did not mean they were incapable of withstanding conditions under a No 9 warning, since not all locations experienced the same intensity. The company also stressed the immediate suspension of services for all open-air sections of line during a No 9 signal was standard protocol that prioritised safety. It explained that fallen trees or debris blown onto the tracks could potentially impact the operation of overhead cables and trains.Hong Kong commuters brave heavy rain as Typhoon Koinu departs city Clarence Fong Chi-kong, founder of Weather Underground of Hong Kong, said decisions on whether to run transport services amid storms should be based on conditions at the time, but noted it also depended on whether the rail operator had the expertise to make the call. Flight operations are not solely determined by typhoon signals. Airlines can analyse the weather conditions and make decisions regarding take-offs and landings based on their own assessments, he said. Fong, who is also a meteorologist at the Macau-based ESCAPWMO Typhoon Committee under the United Nations, said No 9 signals were currently defined as weather conditions that could potentially worsen to a level meriting a No 10 warning, something the MTR Corp was aware of. It is reasonable to suspend their services partially during the No 9 alert, he said. However, if there is no strong wind during the alert in force, allowing passengers to continue their journey until reaching the end station may be worth considering.Hong Kong boy rescued as he walks 8.7km home through country park during typhoon Many commuters were forced to rely on taxis and form long queues at stands when the No 9 signal was issued on Sunday night. At the airports, travellers spoke of waiting times of more than five hours. Fong on Thursday acknowledged operating the Airport Express amid such weather might not be practical due to safety concerns, but said trains could still take stranded passengers to the nearby AsiaWorld-Expo. The Airport Authority could provide essential amenities such as food, drinks and blankets, he said. This approach could have resolved the issue without requiring other modes of transportation to take risks in providing services amid adverse weather conditions.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Please try again later verifyErrors  The because of a huge blaze at London's Luton Airport that damaged up to 1,500 cars and sparked travel chaos has been revealed. More than 100 firefighters battled through the night to extinguish the car park inferno, which left tens of thousands of passengers facing cancelled or diverted flights. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service revealed on Wednesday morning the because of the blaze was a diesel car. We do not believe it was an electric vehicle, Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said. It is believed to be diesel-powered, at this stage all subject to verification. And then that fire has quickly and rapidly spread. Up to 1,500 vehicles may have been damaged by the fire, which broke out on the third floor of the newly-built Terminal 2 car park at around 9pm on Tuesday. The car park partially collapsed as a result of the fire. Speaking to reporters at the scene, Mr Hopkinson said: On arrival my officers were faced with a severe and rapidly spreading fire involving a large number of vehicles that ultimately spread to multiple floors and involved a partial collapse of the car park. The major incident was stood down after the fire was brought under control on Wednesday morning. Flights resumed on Wednesday afternoon as the delayed 1pm Ryanair flight to Cork finally took off at 3:30pm - 18 hours after the last plane left on Tuesday evening. AA technical expert Greg Carter said the most common because of car fires is an electrical fault with the 12-volt battery system. He added that diesel is much less flammable than petrol and in a car it takes intense pressure or sustained flame to ignite diesel. There were no reports of injuries to members of the public, but five people - four firefighters and an airline official - were treated in hospital. There is no suggestion the blaze happened intentionally. Between 40,000 and 50,000 passengers are thought to have been affected by 273 suspended, cancelled or diverted flights. A Polish family on holiday in London told how they slept on the floor at Luton Airport as a result of the fire. Gregorz Szmit, 46, said their flight to Gdansk should have departed at 9.50pm on Tuesday and is now scheduled to leave at 7.30pm on Wednesday. Mr Szmit, speaking from the terminal building where he is waiting with his wife and their two sons, aged seven and 15, said: We were on holiday for five days to visit London - British Museum, Trafalgar Square. This is difficult, I must say. This is our first journey to England, to London. It is been an adventure. Airport hotels nearby Luton have reportedly all been fully booked, as passengers remain uncertain of their travel plans. The fire service posted on TwitterX on Wednesday morning: The fire service have now scaled back at Luton Airport and this is no longer a major incident. A number of agencies have been released from the scene and we continue to work with colleagues from the airport and police. They added that the fire service would continue to be on the scene for the rest of the day after extinguishing the fire. Mr Hopskinson also revealed to reporters at the scene that there were no sprinklers in the car park. He said: We are already talking to the airport about ensuring that any future, and the existing, car parks have sprinklers fitted because this building is not sprinkler protected. Sprinklers may have made a positive impact on this incident. People with cars affected have been advised to refer to the Luton Airport website for further information. Mr Hopkinson told reporters that a ramp is being installed into the unaffected car park because the normal exit route is not safe to take vehicles out. He went on: We have currently got four fire appliances and a couple of other specialist crews but we are very much focused on getting a handover and getting this airport open as quickly as we can. There is a substantial number that are not damaged and our focus as well is can we remove those vehicles safely without causing any danger to the responders. A senior fire officer told The Independent that the fire inside the car park was so intense that the whole structure may need to be demolished. They will probably fly a drone around to assess the damage, they said. But once steel gets above 600 degrees C it become brittle. It was a lot more than 600 degrees in there. While the airport reopened at 3pm on Wednesday, airlines have issed statements warning their customers of further disruption. An EasyJet spokesperson said: While the airport has now partially reopened there are restrictions in place which means that like other airlines we are operating a significantly reduced flying programme for the remainder of the day so some flights are unable to operate as planned. Meanwhile, Ryanair say that affected passenfers will be advised via email, Push and SMS as soon as possible but regret to advise passengers of possible delays or cancellations on flights tofrom Luton. Wizz Air similarly told customers that they would be provided updates on their flight via email and SMS and apologised for the situation that was beyond our control.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A significant drop-off in shipping activity at Israeli ports is threatening food security in the occupied Palestinian territories amid escalating air strikes and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) preparing for a ground invasion. On Tuesday (10 October), the World Food Programme (WFP) called for humanitarian corridors as it launched an emergency operation to supply food and water into Gaza and the West Bank. The WFP said more than 800,000 people are facing dire circumstances in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Insurance premiums for Israel-bound shipments have risen tenfold due to a squeeze on food supplies and threat of transporting goods into Israel's ports. With ships already required to pay a war risk premium for journeys to Israel, logistics and maritime security companies have scaled back operations due to tens of thousands of dollars in additional cost. The Israeli ports of Ashkelon and Ashdod have been most affected. Previously an unofficial port for food imports into Gaza, Ashkelon has suspended its regular operations, said maritime security company Dryad Global told Ship Technology, while Ashdod remains open despite a rocket assault on a nearby power plant. Humanitarian aid efforts have been further impeded by Israel's multiple aerial attacks on the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's only entry point to Egypt not controlled by Israel. Egyptian NGO Sinai for Human Rights said trucks carrying food supplies into Gaza were blocked on entry. The conflict has so far resulted in more than 2,250 deaths on both sides. Ashkelon, a small port city in range of Hamas rockets on Israel's southern coast, is not allowing ships to dock, shipping sources say. Based on AIS data, ships at the Port of Ashkelon are being redirected to the Port of Ashdod to the north, seen as a safer port, Dryad Global said. This mirrors the events of May 2021 amidst the Israel-Palestine tensions. Sirens were sounded in Ashkelon yesterday (11 October) as several people were taken to hospital with shrapnel wounds following a rocket attack. Ashdod power plant - in the vicinity of the port - has also been damaged by an aerial assault. Haifa, Israel's largest port, remains open and operational according to Indian conglomerate Adani, which acquired 70 of Haifa Port earlier this year. Haifa handles 30m tonnes of cargo, but data from MarineTraffic shows a noticeable decrease in shipping activity. A.P. Moller Maersk and Hapa Lloyd are among the European logistics companies monitoring the situation. Shipping routes run between two and four times per week between Haifa and the Turkish port of Gemlik, while southern Italian port of Gioia Tauro to Ashdod port sees between one to two routes run weekly, according to data from Fluent Cargo. Despite being only 22km north of Ashkelon and the Gaza border, Ashdod port is also still open. The port is subject to restrictions on the loading of flammable, explosive or toxic cargo due to the increased risk from rocket attacks, according to Dryad Global. Israeli company ZIM, another prominent goods transporter between Europe and Israel, announced it has offered Israel all of its ships to help with the war effort, the Jerusalem Post reported. In Israel, where nearly all food is imported from sea routes, reports have emerged of bare supermarket shelves as residents rush to stockpile supplies in the increasingly likely event of a prolonged war. Food supplies are expected to be thinly stretched, but aid already flowing in from the US and other western powers should prevent mass food insecurity. The story is different in Palestine. Despite the EU backtracking on an announcement that it would freeze all aid to Palestine on Monday (9 October), support into the West Bank and Gaza has involved backing for the Hamas regime from Iran and Hezbollah, rather than supplies for Palestinian citizens. This has not been due to lack of effort. The WFP's calls for a humanitarian corridor have so far gone unanswered, while Israel continues to block aid from Gaza's Egyptian border entry point. Earlier today, Israel's energy minister said no humanitarian supplies would reach Gaza until Hamas releases Israeli hostages. The conflict has also been a reality check for the recently proposed India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC), a plan backed by the US and EU to transport goods to Europe from the port of Haifa.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

But it was also a notoriously head-cracking time, new research has found! It might seem like a given that organising into cities might have reduced violence among civilised early humans. But scholars are pretty divided on this matter. And some also believe that coalescing into human-dense environments might have actually led to an increase in interpersonal violence, especially when you factor in the increasing inequality among the early inhabitants. A new study provides a clearer picture. Examining 3,539 skeletons from Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Turkey revealed that many of these early inhabitants had suffered bone trauma. Strikingly enough, these were the inhabitants of some of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia and the Middle East. The ratio of interpersonal violence -- i.e. of murder -- peaked in the period of 4,500 to 3,300 years BCE and then fell back again over the course of the next 2,000 years, explains Joerg Baten, the study's project manager. Severe skull fractures and weapon wounds helped characterise the violence among the ancient skeletons. The Early and Middle Bronze Age (spanning 3,300 to 1,500 BCE) was a time of bubbling law-making, administration, trade and culture. Organisation might have helped cities achieve prosperity despite failing crop yields, while legal systems settled interpersonal disputes. The study authors think that this might have helped create the lull in violence during this time. However, peace was not going to last very long, and as cities grew bigger, so did the thirst for conquest and bloodshed. This was only exacerbated by a 300-year-old drought period in the area, leading to a surge in migratory movements. Increasing scarcity of resources and failing institutions due to climate shocks might have escalated lethal conflict levels significantly during this time. While we are just adding more passages to stories of millennia past, it does also serve excellently as a clear warning of what can happen if we fail to mitigate climate change effectively.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Despair is growing among Brits who parked their vehicles inside the 20million car park that caught fire at Luton airport - as they fear they may not be able to get access to them for weeks. Chris Meacey, 57, was relieved to discover his white Ford Custom van sits undamaged having parked it in the ill-fated Terminal Car Park 2 that caught alight after a Range Rover exploded at around 9pm on Tuesday night. But Mr Meacey has since learnt he will be unable to retrieve his car for some time as there is 'no floor in front of it' - after the blaze caused much of the parking structure to collapse. The van is parked metres away from where three levels of the car park crumbled under the pressure of the fire. Mr Meacey, who works for a washing machine firm, is now expecting to wait at least two weeks before the vehicle will be returned to him - if at all, The Telegraph reported. 21-year-old Emily and her friend Mea Digby drove to Luton airport on Monday to fly to Costa Blanca - leaving a Vauxhall Corsa SXi at 4am that morning on the roof of Car Park 2 Emily's father Matthew said: 'The insurance company (Hastings Direct) have been really brilliant today and despite not knowing for sure have accepted a total loss claim and paid out to Emily the full replacement cost' Terminal Car Park 2 caught fire after a Range Rover exploded at around 9pm on Tuesday night The burnt out shells of cars, buried amongst debris of the multi-storey car park at Luton airport Mr Meacey, who was asleep in a hotel room when he heard the explosion, said: 'I woke up at 2.15am, went down to the reception of the Holiday Inn and they informed us of the fire. 'We heard several explosions of what sounded like fuel tanks. Then we heard crashing noises, which I can only assume were the floors of the car park for levels two and three.' Meanwhile, Matthew, his 21-year-old daughter Emily and her friend drove to Luton on Monday to fly to Costa Blanca. The two women left a Vauxhall Corsa SXi at 4am that morning on the roof of Car Park 2 on route to a quick getaway to Spain. Matthew said: 'The insurance company (Hastings Direct) have been really brilliant today and despite not knowing for sure have accepted a total loss claim and paid out to Emily the full replacement cost.'

Authorities on the Canary Islands have closed schools temporarily as soaring temperatures hit the 8-island archipelago. The extreme heat has also rekindled a vast wildfire on Tenerife. The Spanish island group off the northwest coast of Africa normally experiences mild, spring-like weather during the school year, so many classrooms do not have air conditioning. Recent temperatures, however, have been off the scale. Some areas of the archipelago have been scorched by 38C and higher. Reports of students fainting and suffering heatstroke prompted the closures. The mercury hit 38.5C in Adeje in the south-west of Tenerife on Monday, and 37.8C in Arucas in the north of the neighbouring island of Gran Canaria, according to Spain's meteorological agency, Aemet. Weather experts say the high temperatures are forecast to continue. In response, the Canary Islands' education minister Poli Surez announced classes would be suspended on Wednesday and Friday. Thursday is a public holiday in Spain. We want to prioritise the safety of boys and girls at all schools in the Canaries, he told reporters. The high temperatures also helped to revive a wildfire in the northeast of Tenerife, which already destroyed about 15,000 hectares of woodland over the summer. About 100 firefighters backed by nine water-dropping helicopters have been battling the blaze, the regional government of the Canaries said in a statement. The blaze first broke out in mid-August, and was declared under control on 11 September, but was never fully extinguished. Small fires have continued to ignite periodically in the same area due to winds and the heat. High temperatures make extinguishing work difficult and new reactivations are possible, the head of the regional government of Tenerife, Rosa Dvila, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The high temperatures are expected to last until Sunday. As global temperatures rise due to the climate crisis, scientists have warned that heatwaves will become more frequent and more intense.

Travellers told the BBC they were asked to arrive three hours before their flight and one car park had reopened close to the terminal. An investigation into the because of the fire has begun. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it thought the fire started in a diesel-powered car and then spread through the building. The airport said passengers arriving by car could now use the long and mid-stay car parks, while a temporary drop-off was established at the mid-stay car park. However, the Dart shuttle remains closed, with replacement buses running. Emily Cozens, from Nottingham, stayed in a Luton hotel overnight to catch her early morning flight to Lithuania, and was able to park at the airport.

Dozens of flights were canceled, diverted or delayed at Luton, located about 35 miles north of central London, after the blaze started late Tuesday. Four firefighters and an airport employee were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation after the fire. Officials at the airport, which is a hub for easyJet, Ryanair and other budget airlines running flights to destinations in the United Kingdom and Europe, said flights began to arrive and take off again Wednesday afternoon. Investigators believe the fire started with a diesel vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson of the Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. The recently opened parking garage did not appear to have sprinklers, he said. And then that fire has quickly and rapidly spread, Hopkinson told reporters. More than 100 firefighters were deployed to tackle the blaze, he said. Authorities said they do not believe someone started the fire intentionally. Kenya ending Cuban medical exchange NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenya's government announced Wednesday it would not be renewing a 6-year-old deal that saw Cuban doctors employed in Kenya while those from the East African country traveled to Cuba for specialized training. The program was unpopular with Kenya's main doctors union, partly because the Cuban doctors received more than double the average salary of their Kenyan counterparts. Critics argued that money would be better spent on Kenya's medical infrastructure and on its own doctors. Health Minister Nakumicha Wafula announced the end of the Cuba deal at a meeting with health industry workers in the capital, Nairobi, and was met with applause and shouts of yes, yes! Wafula said the ministry would ensure that the country's health workers are well taken care of. Under the deal signed in 2017, 50 Kenyans were sent to Cuba to undergo specialized training, while 100 Cubans were dispatched to county level hospitals in Kenya to help improve services. The move was heavily criticized at the time by legislators and the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, which said it was a waste of resources when the country was struggling with thousands of unemployed doctors and specialists. Panama bus plan aims to curb smuggling PANAMA CITY -- Panama and Costa Rica announced a plan to quickly bus thousands of migrants through Panama to the Costa Rican border, as the countries continue to grapple with a steady increase in the number of migrants moving through the jungle-clad Darien Gap. Panama estimates that 420,700 migrants have crossed the Gap from Colombia to Panama so far this year, making it likely the full-year number will top a half million. Industrial-scale smuggling operations in Colombia have now reduced the dangerous crossing to a little over two days for the strongest walkers. The expedited bus service in Panama will likely decrease further the amount of time migrants take to reach the YOU.S. border, now down to about 2 weeks. Panama hopes the new plan will disrupt the smuggling networks that charge migrants to get through the country, as well as reduce crowding at reception camps in Panama where migrants stay once they exit the Darien Gap trail. Panama's National Immigration Service said 30 buses carried a group of almost 1,600 migrants Tuesday from Panama to a Costa Rican migrant center in Corredores, just inside Costa Rica.

The hurricane knocked over trees and blew roofs off houses with winds as high as 140 mph before moving inland. Laura Velzquez, the head of Mexico's civil defense system, said Wednesday that one person died on the northern outskirts of Puerto Vallarta after being hit by a falling tree, and two others were injured elsewhere in the area. The governor of Jalisco state, Enrique Alfaro, said another man drowned in a town south of where the hurricane hit when he tried to cross a swollen river late Tuesday night. The YOU.S. National Hurricane Center said Wednesday that Lidia's winds were down to 35 mph as it dissipated about 145 miles north-northeast of the city of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city and the capital of the western state of Jalisco. Lidia made landfall Tuesday on Cabo Corrientes, a sparsely populated peninsula, and then moved inland south of Puerto Vallarta with winds of 105 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Railway authorities have initiated investigations while providing compensation to the victims' families, and relief efforts are underway. The derailment of the Delhi-Kamakhya North East Express train in Bihar's Buxar has resulted in a tragic loss of life, claiming at least four passengers on a Wednesday evening. Reports from a Railway Police Force official indicate that approximately 70 individuals sustained injuries as a result of the incident, which occurred when six coaches of the train derailed near the Raghunathpur station. In response to this distressing event, the Railways declared an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 10 lakh to be provided to the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the train derailment. Additionally, Rs 50,000 would be offered to those injured. Visual images of the accident depict two AC III Tier coaches that had overturned, while four other coaches had veered off the tracks during the derailment. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, local residents rushed to the scene to assist passengers and help them exit the derailed coaches. Several police officials and ambulances quickly responded to the situation upon receiving notification of the incident. On Thursday morning, efforts were underway to remove the derailed train from the tracks. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw extended his condolences for the lives lost and confirmed that evacuation and rescue operations were completed, with all coaches inspected. The minister also pledged that an investigation would be launched to determine the root because of the derailment. The derailment took place after the 23-coach 12506 North East Express had departed from the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi at 7.40 am on Wednesday, embarking on its nearly 33-hour journey to Kamakhya, located about six kilometers away from Guwahati. The accident occurred at approximately 9.53 pm, less than half an hour after the train had left Buxar station and was en route to Ara. Following the derailment, several trains were either canceled or rescheduled due to the damage inflicted on electric wires, poles, and rail tracks. Alternate arrangements were made to transport passengers from the derailed train to their respective destinations. The railways swiftly established emergency helpline numbers for passengers affected by the incident. The Assam Chief Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, expressed his condolences to the affected families and confirmed that a relief train had already departed to assist stranded passengers from the derailed train. In response to the incident, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav instructed the disaster management and health departments to take immediate action to provide relief to as many people as possible. He also reported that he had spoken to the district magistrates of Buxar and Bhojpur.

He said Brazil's bumper soy crop is already out the door, but conditions could prove tricky for shipping this year's second corn harvest. The chief executive of barge operator Hidrovias do Brasil said there was no impact yet on its routes along the Tapajos, where barges typically run at two-thirds capacity in the dry season. CEO Fabio Schettino said climactic conditions may postpone the rainy season, which often starts in November, by weeks or a month, adding that he saw the unusual weather as part of annual variation rather than a structural change. Meteorologist Gilvan Sampaio, from Brazilian space agency INPE, said this year's drought in the Amazon could prove to be the worst on record. He said the dryness might last through 2024 if El Nio intensifies in the Pacific Ocean and there is no cooling of tropical waters in the North Atlantic.

(AP) -- A semi-trailer truck driver was killed when a train derailed and a bridge collapsed, spewing coal and mangled train cars across a highway near Pueblo, Colorado, on Sunday, authorities said. The driver has died, but no further details were available, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said by telephone on Monday. No other vehicles were involved, Perez said. The Colorado State Patrol and the sheriff's office posted photos and videos showing a partially collapsed bridge over the interstate with the semi-truck caught beneath. The images also show a pileup of train cars, train wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway. It was unclear when the bridge collapsed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler said. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations on the derailment and collapse. He said officials would be ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said just a few hours before Biden was set to take off for the trip that it would be rescheduled. Pueblo is one of the anchors of Colorado's sprawling Third Congressional District, which covers more ground than the state of Pennsylvania. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a combative Trump loyalist, won the seat in 2020 and barely held on to it during the 2022 midterms. Boebert has described Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the president's signature domestic legislation and the source of hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy incentives, as a massive failure that needs to be repealed.

A basket carrying relief supplies on a makeshift zip line across the Teesta river in SIkkim. NEW DELHI: India aims to install the first part of an early warning system at some high-risk glacial lakes in the Himalayas next year, a senior official said on Monday, as the country responds to deadly floods this month that killed at least 60 people. There are 56 at-risk glacial lakes in India and the urgency to monitor them was stepped up after Lhonak Lake in the eastern Himalayas burst its banks two weeks ago and caused widespread damage in Sikkim, a small mountainous state wedged between China, Nepal and Bhutan. Reuters was the first to report that India was working on a pilot project with Swiss experts to set up the country's first early warning systems at Lhonak Lake, and also at nearby Shako Cho lake. If the systems had been installed, they could have given 90 minutes warning before floods engulfed homes and structures. We will try some monitoring systems at lakes that are at risk, Krishna S. Vatsa, a member of India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), told Reuters. The NDMA is co-ordinating with Indian and international institutes for the project. State governments will provide recommendations on which of the 56 at-risk glacial lakes in India need to be prioritised for setting up the monitoring systems, Vatsa said. Vatsa said authorities will aim to set up some of these systems by next year to monitor the weather and environment at the lakes as a first component of an early warning system. The full system would be installed later based on the outcome of monitoring. He added though that this was easier said than done given the difficulty in reaching these lakes high in the mountains, which can be accessed only during summer months. Also, these will be unmanned systems running on solar or battery power. As climate change warms high mountain regions, many communities are facing dangerous glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Lakes holding water from melted glaciers can overfill and burst, sending torrents rushing down mountain valleys. More than 200 such lakes now pose a high hazard to Himalayan communities in India, Pakistan, China, Nepal and Bhutan, according to 2022 research, and India currently lags behind its South Asian neighbours in deploying glacial flood early warning systems. The Economic Times newspaper reported on Monday that top officials from multiple ministries will meet on Wednesday to formulate a plan for early warning systems.

Kolkata: From the daily struggles of autorickshaw drivers to trafficking and abuse of women to blatant use of child labour in hotels, Durga puja committees in Kolkata have highlighted different social issues to generate awareness among people this festive season. At Hazra Park Sarbojonin Durgotsav, one of the oldest pujas in the city, the hand-to-mouth survival tales of autorickshaw drivers have been narrated using replicas of the green and yellow three-wheelers adorning the marquee. To give it a real feel, real-life auto drivers will interact with pandal hoppers during the puja days. Sayandeb Chatterjee, spokesperson of the puja committee, said, From the familiar role of auto drivers competing against each other to net passengers and haggling for exact fares, we present their humane side, working 24x7 to feed their families while juggling roles as a parent, a spouse or a son. Though their daily earnings are meagre, they try to keep their families happy and put in all that they can for the good education of their kids, he added. Auto driver Sambhu Sana, who will be felicitated at the pandal on one of the festive days, said, We negotiate through the city streets and its alleys defying severe weather conditions.

We have tried to portray that despite hundreds of Durgas in our households being ill-treated, violated and abused, yet they aspire to defy all odds to realise their dreams, puja committee general secretary Somen Dutta said. The 'Pathuriaghata Pancher Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab' has chosen the theme 'Ritumati' (the issue of menstrual hygiene) to debunk prejudices and create social awareness. Ellora Saha, the working president of the puja committee, said, We sought to drive home the message that menstruation is a biological process of every young woman and they should not be made to feel shy, embarrassed, awkward to discuss it. The puja committee through various images drives home the lessons of personal health and hygiene for girls as well as educating boys to handle this issue with an open mind, she said. The puja committee took three months and Rs 18 lakh to make the pandal, she said.

This event, organized by the rail industry and the British Transport Police, aims to educate individuals on how to recognize and intervene in such situations, as well as report incidents. The latest survey conducted by UN Women UK reveals that sexual harassment is a prevalent issue, with 71 of women in the UK having experienced it in public spaces. The VR film being screened illustrates how small actions, such as offering to change seats or diverting the attention of the perpetrator, can prevent incidents from escalating. It is crucial for everyone to play a role in reducing harm by reporting any witnessed incidents. British Transport Police can be contacted by texting 61016 or by using the Railway Guardian app. In emergency situations, always call 999. This event is part of wider initiatives to combat sexual harassment within the public transport system. Northern, a train operator, has collaborated with students from the Bradford City Community Foundation to raise awareness about the issue. The film being screened at Birmingham New Street station was originally showcased at London Waterloo station. Jacqueline Starr, Chief Executive of the Rail Delivery Group, emphasizes the commitment of the industry to address all forms of sexual harassment and ensure the safety of passengers. She encourages individuals to report any uncomfortable situations. Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley and Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, expressed her support for the campaign, stating that everyone has the right to feel safe on railways and intervene to protect others. Jo MacPhail, HR Director and Deputy Managing Director at West Midlands Trains, stressed the importance of supporting this campaign, as sexual harassment is a real problem in our society, including on public transport. MacPhail believes that equipping individuals with knowledge on what to do in such situations can reduce harm and challenge these damaging behaviors. David Whitehouse, Safety and Security Director at Avanti West Coast, highlighted the commitment of the railway industry in ensuring the safety of passengers. He urges the public to be aware of different forms of sexual harassment and the role they can play in safely intervening and reporting incidents. This virtual reality experience serves as a valuable tool in raising awareness and equipping individuals with the necessary skills to create a safer environment on trains. By working together, passengers and railway authorities can help prevent and address incidents of sexual harassment. Definitions:",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The failure, which occurred early in the day, blocked all lines running in and out of the station, leading to a cascade of issues for passengers. Travellers faced cancellations, delays, and reports of people being stranded on trains, creating a chaotic scene for many. Some individuals, such as one traveler coming from Milton Keynes to Euston, expected their journey to take one hour but were met with a four-hour ordeal due to the disruptions. While the fault was eventually repaired and the lines reopened, the travel woes persisted into the early afternoon, causing considerable inconvenience to those relying on Euston station for their journeys. A spokesperson for Network Rail acknowledged the issue, explaining that a points failure at London Euston had necessitated the blockage of all lines. Consequently, trains traveling to and from Euston faced cancellations or delays of up to 90 minutes. The disruption affected not only commuters but also sports enthusiasts heading to various events, including the Women's Super League Arsenal versus Aston Villa football match and the American football game between the Tennessee Titans and the Baltimore Ravens. Passengers caught in the chaos took to social media to share their experiences, describing overcrowded carriages and crowded platforms as they attempted to navigate their way through the disrupted services. The disruption underlines the importance of a robust and reliable rail network and the potential far-reaching consequences when such a vital transport artery experiences technical issues. While the fault has been addressed, it serves as a reminder of the need for continuous investment and maintenance of transportation infrastructure to prevent future occurrences of travel chaos.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Currently, gasoline is up to 4.25 a gallon. Tucson and most of Arizona is very car dependent due to geography. Our bus system runs every 30 minutes -- weekdays and hourly on weekends. The system has a phone app. What if you do not have a phone, if your phone is out of charge, if you cannot find the app? The bus stops have posted route numbers. There are no bus schedule or maps with routes. Inside of the bus, there is no posted information. As a result of this, bus drivers are continually beleaguered by a thousand questions.

Hobbs for halting Fondomonte Corp's lease of AZ Trust Land for uncorrected land use violations. They are also growing (and exporting) feedstock for a giant Saudi dairy, paying just 21.60acre, including free groundwater. I agree with AG Mayes' statement that exporting said feedstock out of country is outrageous... given the current state of our water crisis. The 1980 Groundwater Management Act initiated the AZ Dept. of Water Resources, resulting in designated Active Management Areas (AMAs) to address groundwater overdraft. Rural counties rapidly losing groundwater would benefit from AMA designation as well. What is the right rate to pump, when groundwater is not being adequately replenished? Water should not be underpriced, but what price water -- our most precious resource? Gov. Hobbs has appointed a Water Policy Council, with recommendations due December 2023 to guide our state's water policy. We the people must write our Legislators and ACC, urging them to listen to these experts, prioritize equitable groundwater policy, and insure AZ's water future for generations to come. Barbara Reuter Southeast side Exposure to the abomination That sorry network is doing it again ... now promoting a national war in its desperate need to gain our attention! As disgusting as has been their incessant lying, they have now invoked this new low as they pander to a certain segment of our population. Such noise goes right along with the Trumpeter's clumsy use of lies, insults, threats, and encouraging violence, predictably parroted by equally disgusting elements of the Republican cult, as they try to overcome the indictments he has earned from our democratic institutions. We of course must continue to subject the unlawful and autocratic behavior of this person and his entourage to those institutions, allowing them to pursue their roles in guaranteeing honesty, fairness, equal treatment under the law ... and un-intimidated execution of justice! As we are exposed to what this abomination is willing to ferment, we are able to appreciate even more what our democratic values have brought us, knowing these and our common decency will bring us past these blights upon our existence! Frank Parsons Northeast side Domestic violence  gun violence Dear Editor, October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month -- a time to remember victims of domestic violence and advocate for its survivors. Unfortunately, last year the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against survivors and advocates in United States v. Rahimi: it is unconstitutional to prohibit people subject to Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs) from accessing firearms. Individuals under DVROs should not legally have access to firearms. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times as likely that a woman will be killed. Prohibiting dangerous people from accessing deadly weapons -- including domestic abusers -- is consistent with the Second Amendment. On November 7th, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to honor the work celebrated in October and protect survivors of domestic abuse. If Rahimi is not reversed, the Supreme Court will put the lives of families living in domestic violence in jeopardy.

The letter writer equates humanity as a quality all humankind possesses; it is not. In order to survive, humans will fight for their land and ultimately their survival. The letter writer fondly looks back to the 1960s, when flower power and endless love made the world better. It was not that way; I know, I was there. He dares to say, ... sure, we had Vietnam, when comparing what he thinks are frivolous wars today. Namely the wars in the Ukraine and the most recent conflict between Hamas and Israel. The letter writer seems to have overlooked the fact that our involvement in a war between two foreign powers (Vietnam) was ordered by the powers that be in the 1960s. Over 200,000 US soldiers died fighting for another country. Compare those fighting in the Ukraine and for both sides in the current conflict in the Middle East; these soldiers are fighting for their land and survival. And there was a six-day war in 1967; the third ArabIsraeli war. The letter writer forgot that as well. Karen Papagapitos Northwest side Employers, employees need fair rules Businesses are seeing more and more of these so-called neutrality agreements, which raises important questions about the rights and freedoms of employers and workers. Neutrality agreements sound innocuous enough. But a closer look reveals they are neither neutral nor are they agreements. Employees have a right to organize. That is not the issue here. What is the issue is the requirement of employers to remain silent during a union-organizing campaign, as these agreements do. Workers are left with only one side's opinion and that side is under no obligation to disclose facts the employee may want or need. And it is a stretch to call these arrangements agreements. In some cases, the federal government literally requires businesses to abide by these contracts in order to conduct federal business. Unions are not inherently bad, but neutrality agreements are. Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly should work to end this practice. Michelle Rill Midtown Act to prevent genocide I lived in Israel and felt the shudder of a Katusha rocket hitting the earth and that vibration moving through my body. That was in 1984. The violence Israelis and Palestinians are experiencing is so much more horrific than that. In order to prevent genocide of Palestinians, it is crucial to call for a cease-fire and condition aid to Israel on adhering to international law. Sincerely, Dev Mayaan Three Points Solar  ACC Re: the October 11 letter Go solar, save water. Kudos to the writer for bringing into sharp focus the water wasting consequences of the current Arizona Corporation Commission's all out assault on rooftop solar. Using tried and true identity politics' messaging by claiming the solar industry is a gigantic subsidy that must be vanquished, the Commission through Nick Myers is waging a multi pronged attack on the solar industry. First, reduce the amount that the utilities pay to rooftop solar ownersleasers and then revisit the 2017 heavily litigated, multi party solar energy export rate structure Agreement. At today's ACC hearing on the solar issue that could cost over 8,000 family wage jobs and decimate an entire industry Myers was called out for playing on his cell phone and purposely not paying any attention to the parade of passionate speakers opposing his scheme. Let them eat cake Nick? People will not forget how you favored out of state Utility shareholders over the water needs of Arizona citizens. Rick Rappaport Oro Valley America's sadism problem In the past ten years I have noticed a sharp upturn in people gaining delight in others' suffering. There are purposeful attack on others' politics, religion or ethnicity. Sadism is a punishment upon those whom are felt to be inferior, unworthy or just different. Our current sadism epidemic can mostly be traced to the rise of fascism, which promotes sadism, belligerence and hate. Sadism is a part of fascism because in most cases, fascism is led by a sociopath. Sociopaths love to inflict pain on others. Once the sociopathic fascist becomes a role model, followers emulate his vile traits. Sadism now becomes normalized in the fascist culture as acceptable behavior. We saw an increase in sadism that manifested itself in Asian hate crimes in the past five years and also obvious antisemitism. We are not going to solve our national sadism problem unless we solve our fascism problem. Fascist role models should not be heroes nor emulated. Doing so, makes us just as sadistic as our abnormal hero. Steve Rasmussen Foothills Corporate water hogs Thank you Governor Hobbs for canceling Fondamonte Corporation's leases of Arizona state trust land. Saudi-owned Fondamonte grows alfalfa for export to Saudi Arabia. They found a free water paradise in Arizona. Private citizen's wells are running dry in rural areas of our state, and there is a severe, ongoing drought affecting the Colorado River basin. It is time to end the practice of allowing these corporations to pump an unlimited amount of groundwater for free. That is why Governor Hobbs needs to apply the same principles and common sense to prevent Canadian-owned Hudbay Corporation from developing the Copper World open-pit mines in the Santa Rita mountains, south of Tucson. A loophole in Arizona's groundwater law allows mining companies to pump unlimited groundwater for free! We do not need another foreign-owned corporation depleting our aquifers for another product that will be exported for refining and sale, while the federal government is paying farmers here to leave their fields fallow. Arizona's most precious resource is not copper; it is water. Rick Johnson Sahuarita Saudi leasing land for their horse feed I am very happy that Gov. Hobbs has stripped the Saudi company from leasing state land for farming state land for alfalfa and wasting our precious water, that the Saudi government will not allow in their own country. I understand this leaves an issue relating to the state land use. May I suggest a way to replace the revenue and maybe improve it. Use the state land for a solar farm, goats managing the weeds under the solar cells (Agrivoltaics), and additionally making use of some of the land under the solar cells for an AquaponicsHydroponics operation. This type of system uses 90 less water than traditional farming, Adaptive redevelopment of infrastructure, and Nutrient management. Overall a yield of more than 3,000acreyr and around 70 Megawattsday electrical generation. An AquaHydroponic farm can also generate revenue, but using various internet sources this could also be in the area of 5,000 per acreyear. Richard Barnes Northwest side Walls work DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who should have been impeached already for dereliction of duty, announced that because of the dire conditions at the border in Texas, 20 miles of wall structure will be built. He will waive environmental regulations to do so. At the same time, he and President Biden said they opposed walls because they do not work. Guess that is why the DHS spent over 400,000 in building a wall around Biden's beach house in Delaware. Guess that is why in 2006, he voted for The Fence Act, that was supposed to build a dual layered fence along 700 miles of border. It was never completed. The Israelis built a wall along the Gaza strip, which curtailed the almost daily suicide bombers that were coming from there. Fences and walls work. Just think about the concrete wall around your backyard. Border walls work too. They stop, delay and impede illegal immigration and narcotics smuggling. I think Democrats oppose a border wall because they want unobstructed illegal immigration. Langhorne Bilby Marana View Comments Tags Localop Subscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Andrew Miller, 59, says his Citroen DS3 may be undamaged despite the structure collapsing due to the extent of Tuesday's ferocious blaze - and the airport saying it was 'unlikely' that any cars were 'salvageable'. However, he said he received no response from either the airport or car park operator APCOA when he asked how he might be able to get home after his holiday. Andrew had left the car - which is specifically tailored to his needs - on the ground floor of Terminal Car Park 2 before flying to Ireland with his husband Tim Meacock. The broadcaster and disability campaigner, who has a complex spinal condition, returned to find the destruction on Thursday afternoon. He said: 'This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence. 'As a wheelchair user, I have got complex access needs and I have spent years looking for a car that I can easily get in and out of.' The Citroen has no central console, making it easier for a wheelchair user to access independently, and fitted hand controls worth around 500 which allow it to be driven by someone without the use of their legs. It was parked in the blue badge zone of the facility, away from the section that collapsed, and Andrew said he was concerned the airport may have been 'rushing to conclusions' when it said the vehicles may be unsalvageable. He said: 'Who knows what damage it might have sustained, I have got no idea what the vehicle looks like up close, but from a distance, it encouraged me that it was not in the collapsed part of the car park.' Upon his return, he said he wrote to APCOA twice and posted on social media to ask how he might be get home from the airport - but did not hear anything back. 'In my view, it was corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind,' he said. 'The whole thing has been a nightmare and proves to me that in a major incident situation like this, the interests of disabled people who need carefully considered bespoke solutions get tossed aside and ignored.' An 'exceptionally kind and patient' airport chaplain helped to arrange a taxi for the couple, allowing them to get home. Andrew said he hopes to be able to get a replacement car from his insurer tomorrow. A London Luton Airport spokesperson said: 'We would like to offer our sincere apologies to Mr Miller for any distress or inconvenience caused. 'We understand how upsetting this situation is and have been working tirelessly to provide more information to our customers as quickly as possible. 'Since Tuesday evening, together with APCOA parking, we have responded to almost 16,500 customer queries. 'Dealing with such a large volume of inquiries, while an investigation is ongoing, has naturally extended our response times. 'The airport chaplaincy team are part of the airport response to major incidents and are equipped to provide support and assistance. 'We are delighted they were able to arrange alternative transport for Mr Miller on this occasion.' They added: 'We recognise this has been an extremely distressing time for all concerned and we would like to thank our customers for their ongoing patience and understanding while we work through the many complexities following this incident.'",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un shake hands during their meeting on Sept. 13. Vladimir SmirnovSputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File TOKYO - Russian ships linked to military transport networks have collected cargo from North Korea and delivered it to an apparent Russian military port on multiple occasions over the past two months, according to new satellite images providing the clearest evidence yet that Pyongyang may be helping Moscow's war effort. The two ships had no record of running this route between North Korea and Russia until August, when high-level meetings between North Korean and Russian officials began, paving the way for Kim Jong Un to meet Vladimir Putin last month. YOU.S. intelligence assessments at the time suggested that Russia was looking to get North Korean weaponry to replenish its dwindling supplies for the war in Ukraine. White House officials said Friday this now appears to be happening and named one Russian vessel, alleging that North Korea has transported as many as 1,000 containers with equipment and munitions from North Korea to Russia in recent weeks. But new satellite images, analyzed by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and provided first to The Washington Post, suggest this operation is more regular, extensive and ongoing than the White House revealed. Not one but two ships have been plying the route between the northeastern North Korean port of Rajin and a secure port facility in Dunai, in Russia's Far East, making at least five round trips beginning mid-August through Saturday, according to the RUSI analysis. Although it is impossible to tell what is being transported, the new images show ships linked to the Russian military logistics network, which strongly suggests these commercial vessels are carrying military equipment, RUSI analysts and YOU.S. officials say. This will have a very serious effect on the trajectory of the war in Ukraine, said Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI. North Korea has the ability to manufacture a lot of ammunition, and it has significant stockpiles. North Korea makes two of the types of munitions that Russia has used heavily in the war - Soviet-era 122mm Grad rockets and 122mm howitzer artillery rounds - and desperately needs more of as its wages its grinding war of attrition against Ukraine. Around the time the shipments began, munition pits were rapidly expanded at an ammunition depot near the Ukrainian border, which YOU.S. officials identified as the ultimate destination for the shipments. YOU.S. officials and experts have said North Korea has Soviet-designed munitions and other conventional weapons, including artillery platforms and rocket launchers, that the Russians are seeking. The new satellite images show that two Russian-flagged cargo ships, the Angara and the Maria, began traveling between Rajin and Dunai in mid-August. They have made at least five trips since, moving hundreds of containers, according to the images. The latest delivery from North Korea to Russia took place on Saturday, when the Maria was spotted in Dunai offloading cargo, according to RUSI's analysis. Shortly before they began operating along this route, the two vessels went dark, turning off the signal of their automatic identification system, according to data from ship-tracking site Marine Traffic. This allows the Maria and Angara to hide their position as they transit between ports. Around the same time, there was a rapid expansion of munition pits at an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk, about 180 miles from the Ukrainian border, images show. These pits have been filled with munition boxes in recent weeks as rail cars arrived, offloading containers that were lined next to the pits. The color and size of those containers matched the shipments arriving at Dunai from Rajin, according to RUSI. YOU.S. officials alleged last Friday that these munition boxes originated from North Korea, and the characteristics of the ships appear to support YOU.S. allegations that North Korea has delivered weapons to Russia for the war using this route. The White House last week released satellite images of what it said were 300 shipping containers delivered by the cargo vessel from Rajin to Dunai by sea, and then transported by rail to an ammunition depot near Tikhoretsk. This transfer was made between Sept. 7 and October 1, YOU.S. officials said. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire in 1953, the two Koreas have been developing huge amounts of conventional weapons in case war breaks out again on the peninsula. North Korea is believed to have a large stockpile of artillery shells and rockets that would be compatible with Soviet and Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. It also has production capacity to manufacture new weapons that would help Russia maintain its high ammunition burn rate as the Kremlin seeks to scale up domestic production. This is widely thought to have been the catalyst for Kim's trip to far-eastern Russia for a rare in-person summit with Putin last month, his first trip abroad since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Kim called his country's relations with Russia his top priority and pledged full support for Putin and his government amid their war in Ukraine. Analysts say in return for supporting the Kremlin, North Korea may be interested in advanced technologies from Russia for its weapons and nuclear program. During his trip, Kim toured a Russian fighter jet factory that is under Western sanctions, as well as a key Russian spaceport. Neither the Russian Embassy in the United States nor the North Korean mission to the United Nations responded to a request for comment sent Sunday. Analysis by RUSI found that the operation may have started at the end of August and appears to have involved a second vessel, Maria, which followed a similar path as the Angara, the ship identified by YOU.S. officials. The images show the two vessels making multiple trips between Dunai and Rajin, picking up and delivering cargo at each location. At the Rajin port, the two ships typically load and unload containers at different docks. In Dunai, the ships have unloaded their cargo while next to a military vessel. Kirby said Russia may have responded in kind by shipping weapons of its own to North Korea. He did not specify the types of arms that the United States believed were shipped. Russia's use of civilian ships to covertly carry out military activities has been well documented. Military analysts recently spotted signs that Russian merchant vessels are probably transporting suspected military equipment from Syria to Russia. The Angara is owned by M Leasing, which has been sanctioned by the United States, the United Kingdom and Ukraine for transportation of weapons and military equipment in the interests of the Russian government. It is managed by Marine Trans Shipping, another maritime shipping company sanctioned for transporting weapons for the Russian government. Registration documents for the Maria show a company called JSC Sovfracht is associated with the vessel, RUSI found. In 2019, the United States named Sovfracht as a company behind a sanctions evasion conspiracy to aid Russian forces operating in Syria in support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. - - - Joyce Sohyun Lee reported from Washington.

Despite the loss of parking spaces, Luton Airport is resuming operations and offers several mass transit alternatives, including rail and bus services. Luton Airport is investing in reducing emissions and sustainability, with low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, Wizz Air, and easyJet basing more efficient aircraft at the airport and implementing green energy initiatives. The October 10 car park fire at Luton Airport has likely resulted in the total loss of at least 1,200 vehicles. However, Luton Airport is resuming operations, and mass transit options are available to get to and from the airport. Unlikely to salvage cars According to an October 15 statement, the odds of cars in Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 being salvageable after the October 10 fire are unlikely. As Luton Airport shared, Regrettably, it is unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable. However, this is still in the process of being assessed. We are working with the Association of British Insurers on behalf of the many insurance companies to establish whether it will be possible to safely retrieve any personal possessions and, if so, how this process may work. Luton Airport also said that it has provided the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) with GDPR-compliant registration details of 1,405 vehicles. But Sky News reports that chief fire officer Andrew Hopkinson believes the number of unsalvageable cars is closer to 1,200. Luton Airport also shared in their statement the following; The emergency services have now handed back control of the site to the airport, and work to make the site safe is ongoing. Until such time, it will not be possible to provide more detailed information or a specific timeline. We remain committed to transparency and resolution and will continue to provide updates as the situation unfolds. One will have to take Luton Airport at face value on their commitments. Less parking, but mass transit alternatives Nonetheless, even with a loss of 1,699 spots, as per parkopedia.co.uk, do not fret. Luton Airport has returned to normal operations and has opportunities for increased sustainability. Close The airport is home to the Luton Airport Express, which takes passengers by rail to London St Pancras International to the south and Corby to the north. The Luton DART (Direct Air-Rail Transit) will also shuttle passengers the last bit of the way. Additionally, Luton Airport has a bus station. Busway, National Express, and Stagecoach all operate coaches from the airport, alongside local buses. Take a closer look at the history of Luton Airport in our short guide. Low-cost airlines investing in reducing emissions from Luton Airport Luton Airport shard earlier this month that three new Ryanair 737 8-200 (737 MAX 8) aircraft will be based in Luton. Additionally, by 2025, Wizz Air will have all Airbus A321neos based there. Finally, easyJet will increase the number of Airbus A320neo family operating flights from Luton Airport. Photo: Longfin Media  Shutterstock As Yvonne Moynihan, Corporate and ESG Officer at Wizz Air, shared in the statement, London is an essential market for Wizz Air, and we are confident that fleet renewal is a crucial solution available here and now to reduce emissions from aviation. Currently, the newest and more fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo accounts for over 60 of our total fleet at London Luton Airport. Ultimately, between April and August 2023, more than a third (33.5) of all flights from LLA were operated using Airbus A320neo or Boeing 737 MAX variants, reducing emissions by up to 20. Photo: kamilpetran  Shutterstock Finally, Luton Airport prides itself on being the third major UK airport to win Level 4 of the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme. The airport's work to get more new, more efficient aircraft pairs well with its sustainability efforts. These include finalizing plans for installing a 10MWp solar plant to generate enough green energy to satisfy 25 of the airport's electricity demand, as well as progress being made on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Bottom line While the loss of 1,699 parking spaces due to fire and collapse is no small matter, especially with at least 1,100 cars now total losses, at least Luton Airport can bounce back with its public transportation connections and long history. Luton Airport is home to low-cost carriers like easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air, all of which are planning to base their newest, most aircraft there. Coupled with an opportunity to induce more transit use, Luton Airport has a chance to be a leader in reducing overall commercial aviation emissions. What are your thoughts?

Two sets of train car wheels can be seen among the coal. BNSF, the operator of the train, said no injuries were reported to its crew. The railroad said it was working with authorities to investigate and clean up the site. Police did not immediately respond to questions about the driver of the truck. Local news reports indicated the driver was killed. How a small-town train derailment erupted into a culture battle A stretch of the interstate, which runs north-south through Colorado via Denver, remained closed in both directions Monday. This will be an extended closure, the Colorado Department of Transportation said in a bulletin for drivers. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the derailment, with a team expected to arrive at the scene Monday. Sarah Taylor Sulick, an NTSB spokeswoman, said the investigation also will examine the bridge and its maintenance. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday he talked to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) about the derailment and that officials from his department were on their way to the scene. BNSF has had 177 derailments this year, according to the latest Federal Railroad Administration data. Lawmakers have been weighing changes to rail safety laws after a February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, that involved the release of hazardous chemicals.

RAIB has launched an investigation into the crash, which saw the locomotive collide with a set of stationary Belmond's Royal Scotsman passenger carriages at Aviemore Station in the Highlands on the evening of September 29. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the crash happened at about 7mph and injured a number of passengers and staff, with one passenger and one staff member being taken to hospital. Inspectors said there was no derailment, but the some damage was caused to the rail vehicles involved. Heritage company Strathspey Railway owns the section of the station on which the crash happened. Police Scotland said previously the two people were taken to hospital as a precaution and, as no criminality was established, it had referred the matter to the RAIB. Flying Scotsman tours were cancelled for a week following the crash and resumed on Saturday October 7, after the locomotive was passed as fit for main line operation following a mechanical inspection. The RAIB said in a statement: Our investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events leading up to the accident. The extent and type of any injuries and damage caused, and how this occurred, will be examined, as will the actions of those involved and the training and competence of the railway management staff. Investigators will also consider the type of operation in use when the crash happened and the policies and procedures in place for managing this as well as any underlying management factors. The statement continued: Our investigation is independent of any investigation by the railway industry or by the industry's regulator, the Office of Rail and Road. We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation.

He had been due to visit CS wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower construction, which just so happens to be in the congressional district of far-right Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert. Meanwhile Israel continues to mass troops around the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected ground invasion amid warnings of a humanitarian disaster. 'The president's trip to Colorado is postponed and it will be rescheduled,' said a White House official. 'The president will remain at the White House to participate in national security meetings.' The White House announced Monday that President Joe Biden was postponing a planned trip to Colorado to talk 'Bidenomics' and would stay in Washington to meet officials Wadea Al-Fayoume, 6, a Muslim boy who according to police was stabbed to death in an attack that targeted him and his mother for their religion and as a response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas A day earlier he condemned an apparent hate crime in Illinois after a six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death. The boy was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch serrated blade, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. His 32-year-old mother also suffered multiple stab wounds but is expected to survive after the attack in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles from Chicago. The suspect, Joseph Czuba, 71, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the sheriff's office said. 'He knocked on the door and that he attempted to choke her, and said, you Muslims must die, and attempted to stab her, and stabbed her,' said Ahmed Rehab, president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Chicago. 'And, she went to the bathroom and called 911. And, this was all in her own words.' Biden said the boy's family were Palestinian Muslims who 'came to America seeking what we all seek - a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.' 'This horrific act of hate has no place in America, he said. Israel was evacuating civilians Monday living in villages close to the border with Lebanon and threatened to 'destroy' the country if the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah enters the conflict. The military issued the evacuation order to residents living within 1.2 miles of the Israeli-Lebanese border as Israel fears reprisals from Hezbollah for its imminent invasion of the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah terrorists have vowed to 'respond' to any move to invade Gaza with the group's chief saying they are 'fully prepared' to join Hamas in its war against Israel, raising already heightened fears of an all-out conflict in the Middle East. Joseph M. Czuba poses for a police booking photograph after being arrested by the Will County Sheriff's Office in Illinois Residents of the 28 villages and settlements close to the Lebanese border will now be evacuated and put up in guesthouses in towns in the centre of Israel that are considered safer - but Hezbollah's huge arsenal of rockets can strike any target in Israel including the main city Tel Aviv. The evacuation order comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the nation was 'approaching a fateful hour' with more than 400,000 Israeli soldiers now gearing up for a battle in Gaza that will see street-fighting erupt in the tiny 25-mile long enclave. More than one million people have fled their homes in northern Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair in a desperate attempt to escape Israel's imminent invasion and continued aerial bombardment of the Hamas-ruled territory. But the United Nations has warned that a 'specter of death' looms over Gaza where millions are stranded amid Israel's total siege that is blocking food, water, medicine and fuel from reaching the enclave. The strip's food and water supplies are running dangerously low, and its hospitals are warning that they are on the verge of collapse, with medics saying health centers are quickly turning into morgues. The UN relief and works agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) also warned 'there are not enough body bags for the dead in Gaza'. Israel declared war on Hamas terrorists last Sunday - a day after waves of its gunmen broke through the border and massacred 1,300 Israelis including women and children. Some 199 hostages are being held in Gaza - higher than previous estimates of 150, the Israeli military said Monday.

The UN said today that 47 entire families, amounting to about 500 people, have been wiped out in Israel's bombing campaign. But undeterred by the comments of human rights observers over recent days, Netanyahu said preparations were being made around the clock to launch the ground offensive, with nearly 400,000 soldiers gearing up for battle in Gaza. He said: 'They are ready to take action to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us. Hamas thought that we would come apart - we will demolish Hamas.' The Israeli military's rules of engagement have reportedly been 'loosened' for the land, air and sea attack to allow fewer checks before shooting. Israeli forces, supported by a growing deployment of YOU.S. warships in the region and the call-up of some 360,000 reservists, positioned themselves along Gaza's border and drilled for what Israel said would be a broad campaign to dismantle the terror group. But much of Hamas' military infrastructure is concealed in urban areas, where street-by-street fighting would likely because mounting casualties on both sides if Israel invades with a ground offensive. Meanwhile, Hamas-backer Iran and Lebanon's terror group Hezbollah, which is also supported by Tehran, have warned that an invasion of Gaza would be met with a 'response'. Last week, Hezbollah chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said the group was 'ready' and would 'contribute' to confrontations against its southern neighbour. And on Sunday rockets, artillery fire and anti-tank shells were exchanged between Lebanon and Israel, threatening to drag the region into open warfare. Hezbollah militants also started destroying surveillance cameras on several Israeli army posts along the border with Lebanon. The terror group released a video Monday showing snipers destroying surveillance cameras placed on five points along the Lebanon-Israel border, including one outside the Israeli town of Metula. Hezbollah's aim appears to be to prevent the Israeli army from monitoring movements on the Lebanese side of the border. Meanwhile, as Israeli jets have carried out bombing runs in Lebanon, the IDF threatened to 'destroy' the country if Hezbollah entered the war. Tzachi Hanegbi, an Israeli national security adviser, has warned the Iran-sponsored terror group to stand down from creating a second combat front - or reckon with 'the destruction of Lebanon'. And IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Hezbollah will face a 'deadly' response if it continues to carry out attacks against Israel. 'Hezbollah carried out a number of attacks yesterday in order to try to divert our operational efforts away from the Gaza Strip, under the direction and backing of Iran, while endangering the state of Lebanon and its citizens,' Hagari said. 'We have increased our forces on the northern border and respond aggressively to any activity against us,' he said. 'If Hezbollah dares to test us, the reaction will be deadly. The United States is giving us full backing,' Hagari said. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister threatened 'no one can guarantee non-expansion of war' if Israel invaded Gaza. At the same time Biden, who has repeatedly proclaimed support for Israel, said that while invading and 'taking out the extremists' was needed, any move by Israel to occupy Gaza would be a 'big mistake'. The warning comes just days after Biden said Israel's retaliatory action must be carried out 'according to the rule of law'. Thousands of families have fled their homes in the north of Gaza, carrying whatever belongings they can, following an Israeli order to move south. 'No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I am losing my humanity,' said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south of the enclave, and is having to stay with strangers.

They also said a ceasefire agreed upon by Egypt, Israel and the US will coincide with the opening of the border crossing and would last for several hours. But half an hour later, Israel appeared to deny that a truce was under way in southern Gaza. 'There is currently no truce and humanitarian aid in Gaza in exchange for getting foreigners out,' a statement from the prime minister's office said. Hospitals in Gaza are expected to run out of generator fuel in the next 24 hours, endangering the lives of thousands of patients, according to the UN. Gaza's sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the enclave following the Hamas attack. The World Health Organization said hospitals are 'overflowing' as people seek safety. 'We are concerned about disease outbreaks due to mass displacement and poor water and sanitation,' it said. Four hospitals in northern Gaza are no longer functioning and 21 have received Israeli orders to evacuate. Doctors have refused, saying it would mean death for critically ill patients and newborns on ventilators. Israel's decision to cut off water supplies, combined with a lack of fuel for pumps and desalination stations, has caused shortages, putting 3,500 patients in 35 hospitals across Gaza at risk. 'Water is needed to ensure sanitary conditions on inpatient wards, in operation rooms, and emergency departments. It is essential for the prevention of hospital associated infections and for the prevention of outbreaks in hospitals,' the WHO said. The YOU.N. health agency said life-saving assistance for 300,000 patients is currently awaiting entry through Rafah. In Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of 3. Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital, where fuel is expected to run out by Monday, said Dr. Mohammed Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex. There were 35 patients in the ICU who require ventilators and another 60 on dialysis. If fuel runs out, 'it means the whole health system will be shut down,' he said, as children moaned in pain in the background. these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.' Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of pediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility did not evacuate despite Israeli orders. There were seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators, he said. Evacuating 'would mean death for them and other patients under our care.' Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the regional director of the World Health Organization, said hospitals were able to move some mobile patients out of the north, but most patients cannot be evacuated, he said. Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory's largest, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its morgue overflowed. Tens of thousands of people seeking safety have gathered in the hospital compound. Gaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege. 'An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes,' said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the YOU.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

The military says it is trying to clear away civilians ahead of a major campaign against Hamas in the north, where it says the terrorists have extensive networks of tunnels, bunkers and rocket launchers. Hamas urged people to stay in their homes, and the Israeli military released photos it said showed a Hamas roadblock preventing traffic from moving south. Nevertheless, a million civilians have fled their homes - fearing that if they did not, they would face certain death. Meanwhile, Israel's ambassador to the UK defended her military's brutal bombardment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, arguing this morning that Tel Aviv's military at least gave Gazans warning that the attacks were coming. Tzipi Hotovely, 44, gave an impassioned and defiant speech, pointing out that Hamas terrorists launched their attacks with no forewarning and slaughtered innocent, unarmed Israeli citizens. 'Hamas are in charge of any harm that will be happening in Gaza to their own people. If we see innocent people get killed in Gaza, it is Hamas in charge,' she said. 'It is not Israel's responsibility - we do not have any obligation to bring Gaza water. 1,300 Israelis were targeted, slaughtered... they did not get 24 hours to flee or protect themselves.' Later, when pushed by a BBC Radio 4 interviewer on allegations that Israel is doling out collective punishment on the Palestinian people, Hotovely hit back, bringing up the Royal Air Force's carpet bombing of German cities amid a bitter campaign to defeat Nazi Germany in WWII. '600,000 Germans were killed in your attacks on Hamburg and Dresden. Why? Because you knew this was the only way you could defeat the Nazis,' she declared. 'We are giving the people in Gaza the opportunity (to flee) that (Israelis) were never given... they were slaughtered in their beds,' she concluded. As more than a million civilians in Gaza fled their homes, analysts suggested Israel could become bogged down for more than a year hunting for terrorists in the 25-mile long enclave. Nimrod Novik, a former senior Israeli diplomat and security adviser, said some military and political leaders wanted soldiers to undertake 18 months of door-to-door arrest operations to root out the Hamas top brass.

The Israeli military also reported shooting at one of its border posts. The fighting killed at least one person on the Israeli side and wounded several on both sides of the border. Meanwhile, the country has been urged by its allies - including Britain - to be 'restrained' in its response so as not to inflame a furious backlash in the Arab world. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducted a whistle-stop tour of Arab states at the weekend in order to preserve the fragile peace in the wider region. He reiterated that Washington stands with Israel 'today, tomorrow and every day' but it must take 'every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians'. But his various Arab hosts did not necessarily share the same view with Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi saying after Blinken's visit to Cairo that Israel had already 'exceeded the right to self-defence'. Blinken returned to Israel on Monday for talks on the conflict after completing the frantic six-country tour through Arab nations aimed at preventing the fighting from igniting a broader regional conflict. The top US diplomat, who was in Israel on Thursday on a solidarity visit, landed in Tel Aviv and was expected to again meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Washington has been trying to broker a deal to reopen Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza to allow Americans and other foreigners to leave and humanitarian aid amassed on the Egyptian side to be brought in. The crossing, which was closed because of airstrikes early in the war, has yet to reopen. Israel has said the siege will only be lifted when the captives are returned.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The crash took place around 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon as a freight train crossed above Interstate-25 on an overpass. Photos from the scene show mountains of train cars and coal strewn across the roadway. Colorado State Patrol Major Brian Lyons estimated about 12 coal cars derailed after the bridge collapsed. 'Expect extended closure in the area due to train cars and coal on the interstate,' the state police office said in a subsequent news release. The Pueblo County Sheriff's Office confirmed the death of a semi-truck driver on Monday morning. The driver was caught underneath the overpass when it collapsed. His condition was unknown for hours after the disaster. The truck was the only vehicle involved in the accident, the Sheriff's Office said. The massive derailment has closed I-25, which serves as the primary north-south route connecting the cities of Pueblo and Colorado Springs. The Colorado Department of Transportation said it would be an 'extended closure.' The train was operated by BNSF Railways, who said none of the crew onboard was hurt in the derailment Neither the company nor law enforcement officials have determined the because of the disaster. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced they were opening an investigation into the crash. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he was in touch with Governor Polis and has been briefed on the situation. 'State and local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected,' Buttigieg said in a post on social media. Sunday's derailment is only the latest in a number of rail disasters that took place in the United States this year.

ICE Brent settled 5.69 higher on the day, taking the front-month contract back above US90bbl - to its highest since early October. Uncertainty and concern over the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war continue to support the oil market. In recent days, Iran has warned about the risk of a wider conflict, while there are reports that Saudi Arabia has frozen talks to normalize relations with Israel. Providing a further boost to the oil market was the US Treasury imposing sanctions on two companies who apparently shipped Russian oil above the US60bbl G-7 price cap while using US-based shipping services. This is the first time we have seen the G-7 price cap enforced, which will raise fears that it will become more difficult to ship Russian oil and tighten the market up further. The US will be careful about enforcing the cap too strongly, particularly given the growing tension in the Middle East. Despite recent developments in the oil market, speculators remain reluctant to jump into the market. The latest positioning data shows that speculators reduced their net long in ICE Brent by 65,161 lots over the last reporting week to 153,174 lots as of last Tuesday. This move was largely driven by longs liquidating. The last week also saw a bit more activity from US oil drillers with the US oil rig count increasing by 4 last week to 501. While only a modest increase, it is still the largest weekly increase since March. Rig count changes in the weeks ahead will need watching because if this continues, it will suggest that US producers could be relaxing the capital discipline we have seen from them in recent years amid the higher price environment. China released its first batch of September trade data on Friday, which showed that crude oil imports averaged around 11.17MMbblsd over the month, down 11 MoM, but still up 14 YoY. This leaves cumulative imports over the first nine months of the year at 11.39MMbblsd, up 14.5 YoY. As for the calendar this week, the market will obviously continue to follow closely how the Israel-Hamas situation evolves. While for natural gas markets, workers in Australia are set to resume strike action at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities on Thursday if involved parties cannot resolve their differences in final negotiations. Metals - Gold breaks higher Spot gold saw significant strength on Friday. Prices settled more than 3.4 higher on the day, taking the market back above US1,900oz and to their highest since mid-September. A fall in US treasury yields will have provided some support to the gold market, while the ongoing uncertainty in the Middle East will likely have boosted demand for safe-haven assets. That said, when looking at weekly changes in gold ETF holdings, we do not see strong evidence of investor buying yet. In fact, ETF holdings in gold fell by 397koz last week to 86.7moz. The gold market has now had 20 consecutive weeks of ETF outflows. However, if uncertainty in the Middle East lingers and rates have peaked, we could start to see gold looking increasingly attractive to investors. Agriculture - Ukraine's corn and soybean harvest jumps The latest data from Ukraine's Agriculture Ministry shows that the domestic grain harvest is up 31 YoY to 35.6mt as of Friday. The increase was driven largely by corn, with the harvest increasing to 5.8mt from 1mt over the same period last year. Similarly, the soybean harvest rose to 3.8mt, up from 1mt last year. Trade data from China Customs released on Friday show that China's soybean imports fell 23.6 MoM and 7.3 YoY to 7.15mt in September, due to weak crush margins, slow presales of soymeal, and poor hog margins. However, cumulative imports are still up 14.4 YoY to 77.8mt over the first nine months of the year. The latest CFTC data show that money managers reduced their net bearish bets in CBOT corn by 46,742 lots to 112,691 lots as of 10 October. The fall was led by short-covering with the gross short decreasing by 36,609 lots to 286,547 lots. For soybeans, speculators decreased their net bullish bets by 2,835 lots to just 2,166 lots - the lowest since the week ending 30 May. Meanwhile, CBOT wheat saw speculators add to their net short by selling a further 5,547 lots, leaving them with a net short position of 104,335 lots.

Crews are working to clear toppled train cars and spilled coal at the the derailment site near the city of Pueblo, which lies about 45 miles south of Colorado Springs, the Colorado State Patrol said. The train operator, BNSF Railway, said its personnel are assisting in the cleanup. Images of the scene posted online by the state patrol show at least ten train cars had slid off the tracks and over the side of a bridge and nearby embankment, blanketing the ground with coal. The bridge, which extends over both lanes of the interstate, appears to be partially collapsed with a semi truck crushed underneath it. The male driver of the truck was killed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler told CNN. No other details on the victim were provided. There were no reported injuries among BNSF crew members, the rail company said. The interstate closure extends approximately 12 miles beginning at Exit 100B in Pueblo and extending northward to Exit 110, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. Both northbound and southbound lanes are closed. This will be an extended closure. Drivers heading between Pueblo and Colorado Springs must detour, the transportation department said in a closure notice. The National Transportation Safety Board announced it is investigating the incident. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said he has communicated with Colorado Governor Jared Polis about the incident and has been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway Administrations. US Department of Transportation staff were headed to the scene Sunday night, he said.

Mr Fidet Okhiria, the Managing Director of the NRC, stated this in a statement issued by the corporation in Lagos and described the report as erroneous. Mr. Okhiria explained that the coaches were being officially moved to NRC in Jos for overhauling and put back into operation. Okhiria reads, The attention of the Nigeria Railway Corporation has been drawn to news trending on numerous social media platforms purported to have emanated from Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), in which it was reported that an attempt was made to steal NRC coaches from Maiduguri. NRC management wishes to clarify this erroneous reportage by stating that the said coaches are officially being moved to the NRC running she would in Jos, Plateau to be overhauled with the view of putting them back into operation. NRC is trying to extend Rail Mass Transit all over the country.'' It would be recalled that the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) had earlier reported that the police command in Borno State had arrested 6 suspects over an attempt to steal 3 train coaches at the Maiduguri railway terminus. According to the NTA reports, Lawan Yusuf, the Borno State Commissioner of Police reported suspects were arrested on Saturday after a distress call about the attempted theft of the train coaches. Yusuf added that one Aliyu Mai Nasara, the principal suspect, was accosted while coordinating the loading of three coaches into trucks. There was a distress call received from railway quarters. Loader trailers were sighted at the railway terminus in Maiduguri evacuating and loading properties belonging to NRC. The properties include; three coaches. On the receipt of that information, the divisional police officer mobilised his men behind railway quarters. One Aliyu Mai Nasara was arrested. Mai Nasara claimed that he is the director of the north-east district headquartered in Bauchi and that he was assigned by the MD of the Nigerian railway corporation to come and evacuate coaches to Plateau State, where according to him, the railway corporation wanted to hand it over to plateau state government, to initiate intra railway transport within Jos metropolis. But the suspect has no identity to certify his claim that he is the district manager of the northeast district Bauchi, Yusuf said in the report by NTA.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Russia's Blac The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has been reporting that the major Russian offensive in the vicinity of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk Oblast, is flagging. Ukrainian military officials say they have continued to repel Russian attacks against their positions. Russian milbloggers (and again, these tend to be hard-war ultras, so to a certain extent their complaints count as statements against interest) attribute some of the Russian difficulties to inability to clear Ukrainian minefields, presumably under fire. One milblogger repeats complaints that worn out gun tubes are reducing the accuracy of Russian artillery fire. This is possible, and gun tubes (cannon barrels) do wear out with firing and need replacement. This, if true, is a logistical and management issue. This same source comments that over-optimistic assessments of unimportant local advances against unfortified sections of the zone may lead Russian forces to 'beat on concrete' fortifications until these forces run out. US and Ukrainian officials said that they would anticipated the Russian attacks, and were confident that Ukrainian forces would hold. John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, said, as paraphrased by the ISW, that Russian forces appear to be using human wave tactics, wherein the Russian military uses masses of poorly trained and equipped Russian soldiers to attempt to advance - the same practice Russian forces used during their failed winter offensive in winter 2023. Sunday's update from the ISW saw signs that President Putin is seeking to cool the more enthusiastic expectations of success around Avdiivka. He is described the operations around Avdiivka as an active defense, not an offensive, or even active combat operations. Sunday morning the UK's Ministry of Defense (MoD) described the importance of railroads to Russian logistics. Rail logistics continues to be a vital component in sustaining Russia's invasion. Russia uses its rail networks to move ammunition, armour, fuel and personnel into Ukraine. The rail network in occupied Ukraine remains largely viable but vulnerable to sporadic interdiction by Ukrainian artillery, air launched missiles and sabotage. In previous conflicts, attrition of rail transportation has required focused, sustained, and repeated attack by air andor ground forces. Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication in Ukraine and is constructing a new railway line to Mariupol which will reduce travel times for supplies to the Zaporizhzhia front. Russia is using civilian contractors and equipment to complete this project, likely calculating this will complicate targeting and preserve military railway troop capabilities for urgent tasks elsewhere. The new line falls within the notional range of Ukrainian long-range precision strike capabilities. Since suffering a series of strikes in August and September, the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) has highly likely doubled down on its defensive and reactive posture, the UK's MoD wrote Saturday. It has relocated many of its prestige assets - including cruise missile capable ships and submarines - from Sevastopol to operating and basing areas further east, such as Novorossiysk. Since July 2022, Ukraine has gained the initiative in the northwest Black Sea, forcing the powerful BSF to defend itself from uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs) and missile attacks as well as special operations. With notable and embarrassing exceptions, however, the BSF has mostly continued to train, maintain and defend itself whilst launching cruise missiles into Ukraine. It can almost certainly continue to do so from the eastern Black Sea. The Black Sea Fleet is now risk-averse. Despite the BSF's largely intact capabilities, there is only a realistic possibility of it using its conventional superiority in firepower to seize the initiative in the Western Black Sea. The risk of further military losses and the dire political consequences of Russian naval forces overtly attacking merchant shipping would highly likely outweigh any gain from attempting to enforce a blockade of Ukrainian-bound trade. The ISW reported that Ukrainian forces hit two Russian naval vessels, the Professor Nikolai Muru tugboat and the Pavel Derzhavin patrol ship, on October 13. As the Black Sea Fleet redeploys to Kerch, Novorossiysk, and Feodosia, lack of pier space and drydock facilities seem to have led them to retain a presence in Sevastopol. Redut seems to have replaced the Wagner Group as the leading private military company. The purported Private Military Company (PMC) Redut is recruiting mercenaries under the guise of volunteers, including former Wagner personnel, the UK's MoD reported this morning. The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) likely supervises and finances the group's activities, including its recruitment. Since the start of the invasion, Redut has been involved in combat operations in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Luhansk oblasts. The group highly likely has over 7,000 personnel. At present, Redut is one of a number of PMCs and Volunteer Corps units being utilised by the Russian Ministry of Defence to augment Russian regular forces. It is a realistic possibility that the Russian Ministry of Defence's practise of recruiting through 'volunteer' units has contributed to Russia avoiding further unpopular mobilisations. Trend Micro describes the recent activities of Void Rabisu, which it describes as an intrusion set associated with both financially motivated ransomware attacks and targeted campaigns on Ukraine and countries supporting Ukraine. In this case the intrusion was directed against the Women Political Leaders (WPL) Summit that convened in Brussels between June 7th and 8th of this year. The Summit's goal was to increase the participation of women in politics, and while that may not have been something the threat actors necessarily approved of, it seems likelier that the conference was simply a target of opportunity, a occasion to prospect and compromise devices and systems belonging to political leaders. The ultimate payload Void Rabisu delivered was a new version of ROMCOM backdoor that we have dubbed as ROMCOM 4.0 (also known as PEAPOD). Void Rabisu is an interesting mixed case of a organization (or, if you will an intrusion set) that has been financially motivated, that trades in the criminal-to-criminal market, but which engages in espionage and, once it is on its target, acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT). Void Rabisu also acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor when it targets governments and military. In June 2023, Void Rabisu exploited the vulnerability CVE-2023-36884 -- still a zero-day vulnerability then -- in campaigns using the Ukrainian World Congress and the July 2023 NATO summit as lures. The extraordinary geopolitical circumstances surrounding the war in Ukraine drives some of the financial-seeking threat actors (including Void Rabisu) toward campaigns motivated by espionage. Some of its earlier, more clearly financially motivated actions have been thought to be associated with a Cuba ransomware affiliate, BleepingComputer notes, but the activity now seems focused on zero-day exploitation for the purposes of espionage. There is no attribution of the activity so far. While we have no evidence that Void Rabisu is nation-state-sponsored, Trend Micro writes, it is possible that it is one of the financially motivated threat actors from the criminal underground that got pulled into cyberespionage activities due to the extraordinary geopolitical circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine. And in general Void Rabisu has consistently acted against Ukrainian interests.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the crash involving the legendary locomotive - which is owned by the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York - happened at about 7mph. It injured a number of passengers and staff, with one passenger and one staff member being taken to hospital, it added. RAIB has launched an investigation into the crash, which happened at about 6.05pm on September 29 when the 100-year-old steam locomotive collided with a set of stationary Belmond's Royal Scotsman passenger carriages at Aviemore Station in the Highlands. Inspectors said there was no derailment, but the some damage was caused to the rail vehicles involved. Heritage company Strathspey Railway owns the section of the station on which the crash happened. The RAIB said in a statement: Our investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events leading up to the accident. The extent and type of any injuries and damage caused, and how this occurred, will also be examined, as will the actions of those involved and the training and competence of the railway management staff. Investigators will also consider the type of operation in use when the crash happened and the policies and procedures in place for managing this as well as any underlying management factors. READ MORE: The statement continued: Our investigation is independent of any investigation by the railway industry or by the industry's regulator, the Office of Rail and Road. We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation. The Flying Scotsman Police Scotland said previously the two people were taken to hospital as a precaution and, as no criminality was established, it had referred the matter to the RAIB. Flying Scotsman tours were cancelled for a week following the crash and resumed on Saturday, October 7, after the locomotive was passed as fit for main line operation following a mechanical inspection. The NRM said earlier this month that the Flying Scotsman would now be available to see at the NRM between October 21 and November 5 on the museum's turntable. It will be the first time since 2016 that the locomotive will be on show in the York museum. A spokesperson for the NRM, speaking earlier this month, said the Flying Scotsman had been passed fit following an investigation carried out by an independent expert on behalf of Strathspey Railway, and the NRM's collections and rail operations teams. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has confirmed it does not require the locomotive as part of its ongoing inquiries, they said, adding that the safety of passengers and the public remains the highest priority.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Officials expect an extended closure to remove the train cars and coal from the roadway, Cutler said. It is unlikely that the road will re-open before Monday. According to the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office, multiple law enforcement and first responder agencies are on the scene, and travelers should avoid the area. Both Pueblo's and Colorado Spring's Fire Departments have confirmed they have units on scene. Cutler said a detour route has been established while the interstate remains closed. Motorists headed north to Colorado Springs should exit at Highway 50 and go west to Penrose and Highway 115 North until they pass the closure.

It is hoped the focus on freight rail will help reverse a YOU.S.398 million (R7,5 billion) loss reported in September 2023. The strategy will be submitted to shareholders this week. The state-owned enterprise has been ailing for a number of years, and South Africa saw the downward spiral of transport services, particularly passenger rail transport, since Transnet offloaded this sector to the Passenger Rail Service of South Africa (PRASA). Transnet was also rocked by several resignations in recent weeks - notably that of CEO Portia Derby who resigned on September 27, 2023, and the company's Chief Financial Officer Nonkululeko Dlamini who left on September 27, 2023, after serving a month's notice, Daily Maverick reports. Derby was given a deadline by the Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan to turn around the parastatal's fortunes, following calls from various quarters for Gordhan to act on the crisis at Transnet. Transnet board member Popo Molefe also resigned on October 13, 2023 after five years. Molefe previously serving as Transnet's chairperson. Siza Mzimela, the CEO of Transnet's freight rail division, was facing enormous pressure to resign because under her watch, Transnet's rail network became inefficient and unreliable for big industry, writes Ray Mahlaka for Daily Maverick. Meanwhile, African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula defended Gordhan in response to criticism that he led the country's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into a crisis. The country's ailing rail and freight infrastructure is, according to a study by South African research consultancy GAIN Group, costing the economy R1 billion a day. On September 1, 2023 Gordhan gave Derby three weeks in which to come up with a turnaround plan after the company announced its 202223 financial results that showed a loss of YOU.S.300 million (R5.7 billion). There has been several attempts to turn around the fortunes of the ailing parastatal but only time will tell if what the country so desperately needs to boost port and harbour operations, and the transportation of goods, will come to fruition.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

(AP) -- A semi-trailer truck driver was killed when a train derailed and a bridge collapsed, spewing coal and mangled train cars across a highway near Pueblo, Colorado, on Sunday, authorities said. The driver has died, but no further details were available, Pueblo County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gayle Perez said by telephone on Monday. No other vehicles were involved, Perez said. The Colorado State Patrol and the sheriff's office posted photos and videos showing a partially collapsed bridge over the interstate with the semi-truck caught beneath. The images also show a pileup of train cars, train wheels scattered across the scene and loads of coal covering a portion of the highway. It was unclear when the bridge collapsed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler said. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending investigators to the site about 114 miles (183 kilometers) south of Denver. The BNSF train carrying coal derailed on a bridge over Interstate 25 just north of Pueblo around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to Kendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad. There were no reported injuries to BNSF crew. The because of the derailment was under investigation and BNSF personnel were working with responding agencies to clear the incident as safely as possible, Kirkham Sloan said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on social media that he had been in touch with Gov. Jared Polis and had been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway administrations on the derailment and collapse. He said officials would be ready to help support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to visit CS Wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing, in Pueblo on Monday, but postponed the trip to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Middle East. The White House said just a few hours before Biden was set to take off for the trip that it would be rescheduled. Pueblo is one of the anchors of Colorado's sprawling Third Congressional District, which covers more ground than the state of Pennsylvania. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a combative Trump loyalist, won the seat in 2020 and barely held on to it during the 2022 midterms. Boebert has described Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the president's signature domestic legislation and the source of hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy incentives, as a massive failure that needs to be repealed.

RAIB has launched an investigation into the crash, which happened at about 6.05pm on September 29 when the 100-year-old steam locomotive collided with a set of stationary Belmond's Royal Scotsman passenger carriages at Aviemore Station in the Highlands. Inspectors said there was no derailment, but the some damage was caused to the rail vehicles involved. Our investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events leading up to the accident Rail Accident Investigation Branch Heritage company Strathspey Railway owns the section of the station on which the crash happened. The RAIB said in a statement: Our investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events leading up to the accident. The extent and type of any injuries and damage caused, and how this occurred, will also be examined, as will the actions of those involved and the training and competence of the railway management staff. Investigators will also consider the type of operation in use when the crash happened and the policies and procedures in place for managing this as well as any underlying management factors. The Flying Scotsman is marking its centenary year this year (Jane BarlowPA) The statement continued: Our investigation is independent of any investigation by the railway industry or by the industry's regulator, the Office of Rail and Road. We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation. Police Scotland said previously the two people were taken to hospital as a precaution and, as no criminality was established, it had referred the matter to the RAIB. Flying Scotsman tours were cancelled for a week following the crash and resumed on Saturday October 7, after the locomotive - owned by the National Railway Museum in York - was passed as fit for main line operation following a mechanical inspection.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Oye! Times,"The Indiscriminate Use of White Phosphorus - A War Crime? Remember this from back in May 2023? My, what a stir that caused in the world's media. Back then, the use of white phosphorus in civilian areas was considered a war crime by the BBC. Bad, bad Russia. Well, it looks like it is happening again but this time, it is new players getting in on the white phosphorus act. Apparently, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has determined that verified video and witness accounts show that Israel has used white phosphorus in military operations on both October 10th and 11th in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip respectively. Here is a collection of videos showing the recent use of white phosphorus against Israel's neighbours: As background, when white phosphorus is deployed in military operations, it is contained in artillery shells, bombs and rockets. It ignites when it is exposed to oxgen, burning at more than 800 degrees Celsius (1500 degrees Fahrenheit), creating a thick white smoke. It can ignite anything that it comes into contact with including fuel, ammunition, structures and, most concerningly, human flesh. Even small fragments have the capability of burning human flesh right the bone. Tiny fragments can also lodge in the flesh and spontaneously burst into flames at a later time. It can also be absorbed through inhalation, severely damaging the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart. While not for the faint of heart, here are some photos of rather horrifying white phosphorus burns from an article in the Lancet: Here is a FAQ sheet from the YOU.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry about white phosphorus: White phosphorus has two uses in military operations: 2.) to create a smokescreen to hide military movements. Since military operations use white phosphorus as a smokescreen, its use is not always forbidden by international law because military and political leaders can claim that it was not being used as an incendiary weapon. White phosphorus can be either groundburst or airburst; when it is deployed in an airburst fashion, it covers a larger area, however, its incendiary effects spread over densely populated areas far beyond where the munitions were deployed. According to the United Nations Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, the United Nations aimed at banning or restricting the use of certain types of weapons that could be considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to either combatants or which indiscriminately affect civilian populations. Protocol III aka the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the use of Incendiary Weapons of the Convention restricts the use of incendiary weapons which are designed to set fire to objects or because burn or respiratory injury to people: Included in these prohibited weapons are both napalm, heavily used by the United States during the Vietnam War, and white phosphorus. In total, 50 nations have signed the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and there are 127 parties that have approved, accepted, acceded to, succeeded to or ratified the Convention. Israel approved the Convention on Marcy 22, 1995 but has not signed it and has added the following declarations: Israel as also stated that it does not consent to be bound by Protocol 3, the aforementioned ban on the use of incendiary weapons. In contrast, both the Russian Federation and the United States have both signed and ratified the Convention as a whole. Israel's historical use of white phosphorus suggests that it is part of Israel's plan to subjugate its Palestinian neighbours as shown in this 2009 analysis, also from Human Rights Watch: Here is a quote from the 2009 HRW report with my bolds: This report documents Israel's extensive use of white phosphorus munitions during its 22-day military operations in Gaza, from December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009, named Operation Cast Lead. Based on in-depth investigations in Gaza, the report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repeatedly exploded white phosphorus munitions in the air over populated areas, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital. White phosphorus munitions did not kill the most civilians in Gaza - many more died from missiles, bombs, heavy artillery, tank shells, and small arms fire - but their use in densely populated neighborhoods, including downtown Gaza City, violated international humanitarian law (the laws of war), which requires taking all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm and prohibits indiscriminate attacks. The unlawful use of white phosphorus was neither incidental nor accidental. It was repeated over time and in different locations, with the IDF air-bursting the munition in populated areas up to the last days of its military operation. Even if intended as an obscurant rather than as a weapon, the IDF's repeated firing of air-burst white phosphorus shells from 155mm artillery into densely populated areas was indiscriminate and indicates the commission of war crimes. In any case, Israel's use of white phosphorus for any purpose in the extremely densely populated Gaza Strip can only be described as a cruel punishment against those whose only crime is to live in Gaza. History does appear to show that white phosphorus is one of Israel's weapons of choice even though its use as an incendiary weapon is prohibited by Protocol III of the YOU.N. Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, a key part of the convention that Israel cleverly chose to not sign. Apparently, using white phosphorus during a military conflict is only a war crime when it is Russia using it.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

He had been due to visit CS wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower construction, which just so happens to be in the congressional district of far-right Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert. Meanwhile Israel continues to mass troops around the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected ground invasion amid warnings of a humanitarian disaster. 'The president's trip to Colorado is postponed and it will be rescheduled,' said a White House official. 'The president will remain at the White House to participate in national security meetings.' A day earlier he condemned an apparent hate crime in Illinois after a six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death. The boy was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch serrated blade, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. His 32-year-old mother also suffered multiple stab wounds but is expected to survive after the attack in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles from Chicago. The suspect, Joseph Czuba, 71, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the sheriff's office said. 'He knocked on the door and that he attempted to choke her, and said, you Muslims must die, and attempted to stab her, and stabbed her,' said Ahmed Rehab, president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Chicago. 'And, she went to the bathroom and called 911. And, this was all in her own words.' Biden said the boy's family were Palestinian Muslims who 'came to America seeking what we all seek - a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.' 'This horrific act of hate has no place in America, he said. Israel was evacuating civilians Monday living in villages close to the border with Lebanon and threatened to 'destroy' the country if the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah enters the conflict. The military issued the evacuation order to residents living within 1.2 miles of the Israeli-Lebanese border as Israel fears reprisals from Hezbollah for its imminent invasion of the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah terrorists have vowed to 'respond' to any move to invade Gaza with the group's chief saying they are 'fully prepared' to join Hamas in its war against Israel, raising already heightened fears of an all-out conflict in the Middle East. Residents of the 28 villages and settlements close to the Lebanese border will now be evacuated and put up in guesthouses in towns in the centre of Israel that are considered safer - but Hezbollah's huge arsenal of rockets can strike any target in Israel including the main city Tel Aviv. The evacuation order comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the nation was 'approaching a fateful hour' with more than 400,000 Israeli soldiers now gearing up for a battle in Gaza that will see street-fighting erupt in the tiny 25-mile long enclave. More than one million people have now fled their homes in northern Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair in a desperate attempt to escape Israel's imminent invasion and continued aerial bombardment of the Hamas-ruled territory. But the United Nations has warned that a 'spectre of death' looms over Gaza where millions are stranded amid Israel's total siege that is blocking food, water, medicine and fuel from reaching the enclave.

The UN relief and works agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) also warned 'there are not enough body bags for the dead in Gaza'. READ MORE: 'We are giving people the opportunity to leave Gaza. Hamas did not do that for the families slaughtered in their beds': Israeli diplomat defends military's response to terror atrocity, with 2,750 now killed in Palestine Advertisement Israel declared war on Hamas terrorists on Sunday - a day after waves of its gunmen broke through the border and massacred 1,300 Israelis including women and children. Some 199 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - higher than previous estimates of 150, the Israeli military said today. In the days since, Israel has launched a relentless barrage of airstrikes that have obliterated entire neighbourhoods in Gaza and killed 2,750 Palestinians and wounded 9,600 more civilians. The UN said today that 47 entire families, amounting to around 500 people, have been wiped out in Israel's bombing campaign. But undeterred by the comments of human rights observers over recent days, Netanyahu said preparations were being made around the clock to launch the ground offensive, with nearly 400,000 soldiers gearing up for battle in Gaza. He said menacingly: 'They are ready to take action to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us. Hamas thought that we would come apart - we will demolish Hamas.' The Israeli military's rules of engagement have reportedly been 'loosened' for the land, air and sea attack to allow fewer checks before shooting. Israeli forces, supported by a growing deployment of YOU.S. warships in the region and the call-up of some 360,000 reservists, positioned themselves along Gaza's border and drilled for what Israel said would be a broad campaign to dismantle the terror group. But much of Hamas' military infrastructure is concealed in urban areas, where street-by-street fighting would likely because mounting casualties on both sides if Israel invades with a ground offensive. Meanwhile, Hamas-backer Iran and Lebanon's terror group Hezbollah, which is also supported by Tehran, have warned that an invasion of Gaza would be met with a 'response'. Last week, Hezbollah chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said the group was 'ready' and would 'contribute' to confrontations against its southern neighbour. And yesterday rockets, artillery fire and anti-tank shells were exchanged between Lebanon and Israel, threatening to drag the region into open warfare. Hezbollah militants also started destroying surveillance cameras on several Israeli army posts along the border with Lebanon. The terror group released a video Monday showing snipers destroying surveillance cameras placed on five points along the Lebanon-Israel border, including one outside the Israeli town of Metula. Hezbollah's aim appears to be to prevent the Israeli army from monitoring movements on the Lebanese side of the border. Meanwhile, as Israeli jets have carried out bombing runs in Lebanon, the IDF threatened to 'destroy' the country if Hezbollah entered the war. Tzachi Hanegbi, an Israeli national security advisor, has warned the Iran-sponsored terror group to stand down from creating a second combat front - or reckon with 'the destruction of Lebanon'. And IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari today said Hezbollah will face a 'deadly' response if it continues to carry out attacks against Israel. 'Hezbollah carried out a number of attacks yesterday in order to try to divert our operational efforts away from the Gaza Strip, under the direction and backing of Iran, while endangering the state of Lebanon and its citizens,' Hagari said. 'We have increased our forces on the northern border and respond aggressively to any activity against us,' he said. 'If Hezbollah dares to test us, the reaction will be deadly. The United States is giving us full backing,' Hagari said. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister threatened 'no one can guarantee non-expansion of war' if Israel invaded Gaza. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden, who has repeatedly proclaimed support for Israel, said that while invading and 'taking out the extremists' was needed, any move by Israel to occupy Gaza would be a 'big mistake'. The warning comes just days after Biden said Israel's retaliatory action must be 'according to the rule of law'. Thousands of families have fled their homes in the north of Gaza, carrying whatever belongings they can, following an Israeli order to move south. 'No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I am losing my humanity,' said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south of the enclave, and is having to stay with strangers.

They also said a ceasefire agreed upon by Egypt, Israel and the US will coincide with the opening of the border crossing and would last for several hours. READ MORE: Shocking moment wounded female Israeli soldiers cowering under a table after being injured by a grenade are shot dead by Hamas gunmen Advertisement But half an hour later, Israel appeared to deny on Monday that a truce was under way in southern Gaza. 'There is currently no truce and humanitarian aid in Gaza in exchange for getting foreigners out,' a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. Hospitals in Gaza are expected to run out of generator fuel in the next 24 hours, endangering the lives of thousands of patients, according to the UN. Gaza's sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the enclave following the Hamas attack. The World Health Organization said hospitals are 'overflowing' as people seek safety. 'We are concerned about disease outbreaks due to mass displacement and poor water and sanitation,' it said. Four hospitals in northern Gaza are no longer functioning and 21 have received Israeli orders to evacuate. Doctors have refused, saying it would mean death for critically ill patients and newborns on ventilators. Israel's decision to cut off water supplies, combined with a lack of fuel for pumps and desalination stations, has caused shortages, putting 3,500 patients in 35 hospitals across Gaza at risk. 'Water is needed to ensure sanitary conditions on inpatient wards, in operation rooms, and emergency departments. It is essential for the prevention of hospital associated infections and for the prevention of outbreaks in hospitals,' the WHO said. The YOU.N. health agency said life-saving assistance for 300,000 patients is currently awaiting entry through Rafah. In Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of 3. Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital, where fuel is expected to run out by Monday, said Dr. Mohammed Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex. There were 35 patients in the ICU who require ventilators and another 60 on dialysis. If fuel runs out, 'it means the whole health system will be shut down,' he said, as children moaned in pain in the background. these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.' Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of pediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility did not evacuate despite Israeli orders. There were seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators, he said. Evacuating 'would mean death for them and other patients under our care.' Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the regional director of the World Health Organization, said hospitals were able to move some mobile patients out of the north, but most patients cannot be evacuated, he said. Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory's largest, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its morgue overflowed. Tens of thousands of people seeking safety have gathered in the hospital compound. Gaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege. 'An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes,' said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the YOU.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

The military says it is trying to clear away civilians ahead of a major campaign against Hamas in the north, where it says the terrorists have extensive networks of tunnels, bunkers and rocket launchers. Hamas urged people to stay in their homes, and the Israeli military released photos it said showed a Hamas roadblock preventing traffic from moving south. Nevertheless, a million civilians have fled their homes - fearing that if they did not, they would face certain death. Meanwhile, Israel's ambassador to the UK today defended her military's brutal bombardment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, arguing this morning that Tel Aviv's military at least gave Gazans warning that the attacks were coming. Tzipi Hotovely, 44, gave an impassioned and defiant speech, pointing out that Hamas terrorists launched their attacks with no forewarning and slaughtered innocent, unarmed Israeli citizens. 'Hamas are in charge of any harm that will be happening in Gaza to their own people. If we see innocent people get killed in Gaza, it is Hamas in charge,' she said. 'It is not Israel's responsibility - we do not have any obligation to bring Gaza water. 1,300 Israelis were targeted, slaughtered... they did not get 24 hours to flee or protect themselves.' Later, when pushed by a BBC Radio 4 interviewer on allegations that Israel is doling out collective punishment on the Palestinian people, Hotovely hit back, bringing up the Royal Air Force's carpet bombing of German cities amid a bitter campaign to defeat Nazi Germany in WWII. '600,000 Germans were killed in your attacks on Hamburg and Dresden. Why? Because you knew this was the only way you could defeat the Nazis,' she declared. 'We are giving the people in Gaza the opportunity (to flee) that (Israelis) were never given... they were slaughtered in their beds,' she concluded. As more than a million civilians in Gaza fled their homes, analysts suggested Israel could become bogged down for more than a year hunting for terrorists in the 25-mile long enclave. Nimrod Novik, a former senior Israeli diplomat and security adviser, said some military and political leaders wanted soldiers to undertake 18 months of door-to-door arrest operations to root out the Hamas top brass.

The Israeli military also reported shooting at one of its border posts. The fighting killed at least one person on the Israeli side and wounded several on both sides of the border. Meanwhile, the country has been urged by its allies - including Britain - to be 'restrained' in its response so as not to inflame a furious backlash in the Arab world. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducted a whistle-stop tour of Arab states at the weekend in order to preserve the fragile peace in the wider region. He reiterated that Washington stands with Israel 'today, tomorrow and every day' but it must take 'every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians'. But his various Arab hosts did not necessarily share the same view with Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi saying after Blinken's visit to Cairo that Israel had already 'exceeded the right to self-defence'. Blinken returned to Israel on Monday for talks on the conflict after completing the frantic six-country tour through Arab nations aimed at preventing the fighting from igniting a broader regional conflict. The top US diplomat, who was in Israel on Thursday on a solidarity visit, landed in Tel Aviv and was expected to again meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Washington has been trying to broker a deal to reopen Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza to allow Americans and other foreigners to leave and humanitarian aid amassed on the Egyptian side to be brought in. The crossing, which was closed because of airstrikes early in the war, has yet to reopen. Israel has said the siege will only be lifted when the captives are returned.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Its claims are based on an image released Friday showing a shipment from an ammunition depot in North Korea, or DPRK, that was loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by rail to a depot along Russia's southwestern border. The delivery took place between Sept. 7 and October 1, the YOU.S. says. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians, and further Russia's illegitimate war, National Security Council Director of Strategic Communications John Kirby said Friday. Kirby has disclosed that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions. He said that the YOU.S. believes Kim Jong Un is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions -- to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime, Kirby warned. He noted that Washington is in lockstep with allies and partners to counter arms deals between Russia and North Korea by sanctioning individuals and entities working to facilitate such arms deals. We will not allow the DPRK to aid Russia's war machine in secret, and the world should know about the support that Russia may again provide the DPRK in return, Kirby said. North Korea on Friday lambasted the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it an undisguised military provocation and proof that the YOU.S. plans an attack against it. North Korea threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. Targeting Odesa Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, during a visit to the Black Sea port of Odesa, pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defenses and to increase the security of a humanitarian corridor for grain exports. Zelenskyy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black Sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are a vital source of revenue for Ukraine's defense spending following Russia's invasion last year. We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole, Zelenskyy said. The Odesa region has become a frequent target of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed upwards of 300,000 tons of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels had been already loaded with grain for exports and used a new humanitarian grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian airstrikes during the winter, Rutte said Friday. This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So, the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric airstrikes, Rutte said in Odesa. Rutte also said the Netherlands would help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Funding the effort European Union leaders meeting later in October will demand decisive progress on using Russian assets frozen by sanctions to help Ukraine, according to their draft statement, addressing a matter that has been stuck for months. The United States and Britain last month showed support for an EU plan to tax windfall profits generated by frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine as Kyiv battles a full-scale Russian invasion begun in February 2022. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven, or G7, industrialized countries meeting in Morocco on Thursday estimated 280 billion worth of such assets had been frozen. They said they expected more work in the coming months to find legally sound ways of using them to aid Ukraine. Belgium, not a member of the G7 group, where most frozen Russian central bank assets are held, said it expects to collect 2.4 billion in taxes on the assets and use them to help Ukraine's reconstruction process, a spokesperson for Belgium's prime minister said Wednesday. Britain is planning to increase its military presence in northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, or JEF, defense cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. JEF, a defense cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to outside activity, stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent, Sunak said in a statement.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

When DeSantis announced he signed an executive order to authorize rescue operations to bring home stranded Floridians via chartered planes, lame losers were quick to remind DeSantis that he is only a governor and has no power to do that. Naturally CNN senior political correspondent Adam Kinzinger was quick to criticize. Imagine being such a tool of the left in order to keep a job with CNN. Kinzinger is blasting a governor for bringing residents of his state home in an emergency situation. Does he think that DeSantis should have ignored pleas for help like Joe Biden does when Americans overseas need help? Well, Adam, the first plane carrying 300 Floridians home landed at Tampa International Airport on Sunday night and the governor and his wife, Casey, were there to greet them. Sorry to disappoint Kinzinger but when DeSantis says he is doing something, he gets it done. That is his brand. He keeps his word and gets stuff done. It is how he turned a purplish swing state into a bright red state. His record of governing in Florida is stellar. Once the plane landed in Tampa, evacuees were able to access resources from multiple state agencies. Additionally, the governor is sending medical supplies, hygiene products, clothing and children's toys to Israel to help impacted Israelis, the news release said. Bryan Stern, CEO and founder of Project DYNAMO, the search and rescue non-profit organization that facilitated the flight, told reporters that 270 people were on board the plane. The rescuees included 91 children and four dogs, Stern said. Many people on the plane cried when it touched down in Tampa, he added. DeSantis knew he could do what he was doing when he signed the executive order. The EO enabled Florida Division of Emergency Management to bring Floridians home and to transport supplies to Israel. Competence is refreshing, is not it? I am proud of how quickly we have been able to activate resources and do what the federal government could not -- get Floridians and other Americans back home, reunited with their families, free of charge, DeSantis said in Sunday's news release. More than 20,000 YOU.S. citizens are stranded in Israel and Gaza and reaching out to the State Department for help in leaving Israel. Good luck to them.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Residents of the densely populated coastal strip had been given more time to move, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said. Israeli army spokesman Arye Sharuz Shalicar rejected claims that adverse weather was the reason for the delay in comments to German public broadcaster ARD on Sunday evening. According to an unconfirmed media report, the ground offensive had been planned for this weekend, but was postponed due to cloudy skies and poor visibility for pilots and drones. There were reports that Hamas was preventing civilians from fleeing. Israel has repeatedly accused the Islamist organisation of using its own population as human shields. Israels repeated instructions to Gazans to leave the area have been widely criticised, including by the UN which has warned of the danger of a humanitarian catastrophe.Biden weighs Israel visit, warns against Gaza occupation More than 600,000 residents of the Gaza Strip have heeded the calls to move from the Gaza City region in the north to the south of the strip, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari has said. Hagari repeated that Israeli forces were targeting Hamas, and were seeking to avoid harming civilians. The coastal enclave of Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2.2 million people living on around 45 sq km. The Israeli military has been bombarding targets in Gaza since the unprecedented attacks on Israeli civilians carried out by Hamas fighters on October 7. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organisation by the European Union, the United States and Israel. The IDF said on Sunday it had attacked more than 100 Hamas military targets in Zeitoun, Khan Younis and western Jabalia, hitting operational command centres, military facilities, dozens of launching pads for anti-tank missiles and observation posts. Israels goal is to wipe out the political and military leadership of the Islamist organisation Hamas, which launched thousands of rockets toward Israel while hundreds of its fighters breached border defences in an unprecedented surprise attack over a week ago in a massacre that left more than 1,300 dead, including 286 servicemen and women. One week after the start of the latest conflict, the number of dead in the Gaza Strip has risen to 2,670, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Sunday. Around 9,200 others were injured in the territory, which is under the control of Hamas, it said.Arab paramedic who treated Israelis injured by Hamas remembered as a hero More than 1,000 people have been buried under rubble in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli armys bombardment in response to Hamas large-scale attacks last weekend, according to Palestinian sources. There were injured and dead among them, the civil defence authorities in the Gaza Strip announced on Sunday. Many of those affected were rescued alive from under the rubble of destroyed buildings 24 hours after bombings, it added. This means that the number of reported dead on the Palestinian side in just over a week is already higher than during the Gaza war in 2014, when 2,250 people died in the coastal strip within 50 days. At that time, 66 Israeli soldiers and five civilians were also killed. The new conflict is the confrontation with the most deaths since Hamas violently took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met for the first time with representatives of the relatives of the hostages taken over a week ago by Hamas, Israeli media reported on Sunday. The Palestinian militant organisation abducted more than 150 people in the attack. The relatives of the hostages have been criticising Israels government. They accuse the leadership of abandoning the prisoners.Israel gone beyond self-defence in Gaza: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Since Hamas attacks on Israel and the Israeli armys counter-attacks on Gaza, there have been regular incidents along the border between Israel and Lebanon in recent days, fuelling concerns of further escalation. The Hezbollah militia, which is trained and financed by Iran, is considered much more powerful than Hamas. Several towns in northern Israel were again put on alert on Sunday after rockets were fired from Lebanon, the IDF said. The Israeli army said it attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanon again on Sunday evening. The military did not provide further details, including whether there were other attacks from Lebanon. Hezbollah and the military wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam Brigades, both claimed to have fired rockets in retaliation for Israels bombing of Gaza. Sources close to Hezbollah said that the renewed rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel was a warning  It does not mean that Hezbollah has entered the conflict. Israel also has no interest in widening the current conflict, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday. If Hezbollah opts for war, they will pay a very high price, he warned. But if they restrain themselves, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is.Hamas, Iran leaders to boost cooperation after historic victory against Israel The US administration has made clear that the civilian population needs to be protected in any Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip, US President Joe Bidens National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. Sullivan stressed that the US hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza are the highest possible priority for Biden. While there were 15 US citizens unaccounted for, he was unable to confirm the precise number of hostages being held. Netanyahu and Biden have agreed to reopen water supplies in southern Gaza. The decision will contribute to the movement of civilians from the north of the coastal strip to the south, Israels Energy Minister Israel Katz wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday. Israels army could thus intensify the destruction of Hamas infrastructure in the north of the Gaza Strip, he wrote. Eyewitnesses reported in the evening that the water supply in the coastal strip had been restored. Many residents came to public water stations to fill canisters and bottles.

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. An official investigation has been launched into the Flying Scotsman crash in Aviemore which left two people in hospital. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it will be examining a number of key areas in the probe following the accident at around 6.05pm at Aviemore on September 29. The world famous steam locomotive collided with a set of stationary passenger coaches on the Strathspey Steam Railway line next to the Aviemore mainline station. The RAIB said the collision occurred at approximately 7 mph (11 kmh). Inspectors said the accident resulted in injuries being caused to a 'number of passengers and staff' with one passenger and one member of staff taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness as a precautionary measure. The RAIB said no rail vehicles derailed as a result of the incident although some damage was caused to the vehicles involved. The investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events leading up to the accident. It will also consider:  the actions of those involved and anything that may have influenced them.  The management of the railway staff involved in the accident, including their training and competence.  The method of operation in use when the collision occurred and the policies and procedures in place for managing such operations.  The extent and type of any injuries and damage caused, and how they occurred. Flying Scotsman leaves quietly after eventful visit A RAIB spokesperson said: Our investigation is independent of any investigation by the railway industry or by the industry's regulator, the Office of Rail and Road. We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation. This report will be available on our website. Police Scotland said previously the two people were taken to hospital as a 'precaution' and, as no criminality was established, it had referred the matter to the RAIB. Flying Scotsman tours were cancelled for a week following the crash and resumed on Saturday October 7, after the locomotive - owned by the National Railway Museum in York - was passed as fit for main line operation following a mechanical inspection.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Earlier in August, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea's capital to convince the country's leadership to provide artillery ammunition that Russian forces could use in its war against Ukraine. In the spring of 2023, Moscow reportedly approached Pyongyang with the offer of food supplies in exchange for weapons.

As explained, the adjacent Ashkelon port has been shut down due to the ongoing missile danger, especially in southern Israel. The major port in the area, Ashdod, has put limitations on the transportation of hazardous products, slowing transit times. However, the Ashdod port has continued its operations, vowing to supply Israel's economy without interruption, even amid wartime conditions. At least three cargo and dry bulk ships bound for Ashdod have stopped in adjacent seas, according to data from the ship monitoring and marine analytics service MarineTraffic, and three additional ships, including an oil tanker and a container ship, are on their way to the port. Presently, approximately 13 ships, including cargo, container, and dry bulk vessels, are docked within Ashdod port, as indicated by MarineTraffic data. Reuters highlights that, the Port of Haifa has confirmed that it continues to operate over the weekend. It handles a variety of cargo categories, including dry bulk items. It seeks to carry a variety of commodities, including cargoes from Ashdod that were diverted. Furthermore, in comparison to other ports, ships typically experience longer wait times when docking in Israel.

Andrew Miller, 56, parked his automatic Citroen DS 3 on the ground floor of Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 in the blue badge parking zone on 8 October, before taking a trip to Ireland. He and his husband Tim Meacock, also 56, returned to the airport on Thursday afternoon, and said there was no one from the airport or APCOA, its parking provider, to give him information on how to return home. Mr Miller, a broadcaster, cultural consultant and disability campaigner from Northamptonshire, said the situation had been a nightmare and accused the airport and APCOA of corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind. It comes as Luton Airport said on Sunday it was unlikely that any vehicles will be salvageable following the car fire which broke out on Tuesday, causing the site to collapse. Mr Miller, who has a complex spinal condition and has always been a wheelchair user, said he could see his vehicle from the car park appearing to be relatively undamaged, and he was concerned the airport could be rushing to conclusions. In response to Mr Miller's situation, a spokesperson for London Luton Airport offered sincere apologies for any distress or inconvenience caused. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence, Mr Miller said. As a wheelchair user, I have got complex access needs and I have spent years looking for a car that I can easily get in and out of. Mr Miller said he bought his automatic Citroen DS 3 outright two weeks ago after leasing the vehicle for five years from Motability, an organisation which supports disabled drivers. The vehicle model is no longer in production, going off-sale in 2019. Mr Miller added: It is quite bespoke and precious to me and it really is my independence. He said the vehicle, a three-door car without a central console, is much easier for a wheelchair user to get in and out of independently, adding: It is going to be very difficult for me to find another one; not impossible, but very difficult. He has also fitted hand controls to the vehicle, explaining they are connected to the brake and accelerator to allow someone without the use of their legs to operate the car, adding they would cost about 500 to replace. Mr Miller said he wrote to APCOA twice, as well as posting on X, formerly Twitter, to ask Luton Airport for information on how he could return home on his arrival at the airport, but had no response. Mr Miller said when he landed at the airport he was assisted by the chaplain, who is part of the support service and available to assist those in difficulty and was exceptionally kind and patient and helped arrange a taxi for the couple to return home. In my view, it was corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind, he said. The whole thing has been a nightmare and proves to me that in a major incident situation like this, the interests of disabled people who need carefully considered bespoke solutions get tossed aside and ignored. Of Luton Airport's statement on Sunday, Mr Miller said he was concerned they (the airport) might be rushing to conclusions if cars like mine are potentially salvageable. Who knows what damage it might have sustained, I have got no idea what the vehicle looks like up close, but from a distance, it encouraged me that it was not in the collapsed part of the car park, he said. Mr Miller hopes he will be able to get a replacement vehicle from his insurer from Tuesday. A London Luton Airport spokesperson said: We would like to offer our sincere apologies to Mr Miller for any distress or inconvenience caused. We understand how upsetting this situation is and have been working tirelessly to provide more information to our customers as quickly as possible. Since Tuesday evening, together with APCOA parking, we have responded to almost 16,500 customer queries. Dealing with such a large volume of inquiries, while an investigation is ongoing, has naturally extended our response times. The airport chaplaincy team are part of the airport response to major incidents and are equipped to provide support and assistance. We are delighted they were able to arrange alternative transport for Mr Miller on this occasion. The airport added it had been an extremely distressing time and thanked customers for their patience. Our team have been tirelessly working around the clock to keep customers informed of developments. Given the scale of the damage, it is unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable. However, this is still in the process of being assessed. We are also working with the Association of British Insurers on behalf of the many insurance companies to establish whether it will be possible to safely retrieve any personal possessions and, if so, how this process may work.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

CTA leaders worry that riders feel a sense of complacency around climbing onto the tracks, chief safety and security officer Nancy-Ellen Zusman said. Zusman and the CTA hope to bring rail trespassing, and the harms that can result, onto a downward trajectory with a new rail safety campaign launched Monday. It is more common for people to climb down onto the tracks to retrieve objects than because they are intoxicated or suicidal, Zusman said. In fact, suicide is the least common reason, followed by intoxication. But it is most common for riders to climb down for no known reason at all. Fifty-three percent of people who have climbed onto CTA tracks this year as of August had no known reason for doing so, according to CTA personnel. CTA trains are powered by an electrified third rail, which carries 600 volts of electricity -- a potentially lethal amount. Unfortunately, we do see cases in which people are just goofing around, CTA spokesperson Brian Steele said. ... They are not retrieving an item, they have not fallen, they just make the decision to go down there. The CTA's first rail safety campaign launched 10 years ago last month. Trespassing incidents on CTA tracks dropped 17 the following year, Steele said. Was the campaign solely responsible for that? Hard to say, Steele said. However, there is no question that the campaign really raised awareness and began a lot of dialogue. Though the CTA has not tracked trespassing consistently since the first rail safety campaign in 2013, Steele said, reduced rail service during 2020 led to a recent annual low of 1,584 trespassing. In 2021, about 1,900 people stepped onto the CTA tracks and 1,860 in 2022. Steele says the CTA expects another slight drop in trespassing incidents by the end of this year. Service interruptions due to trespassing on the electrified CTA tracks, also known as rail right of way, are most common on the Red and Blue lines, Steele said. So far this year, 350 trespassers climbed down onto Red Line tracks, with 323 trespassers on Blue Line tracks. The Yellow Line, traveling between Rogers Park and Skokie, sees the fewest rail right-of-way delays, with 30 trespassers so far this year. Service interruptions due to rail trespassing have caused 93 hours of delays through August of this year, Steele said. The CTA does not track what proportion of delays overall are caused by trespassing, though rail right-of-way delays are most common during weekday rush hours, Steele said. It is basically just a function of the ridership -- when more people are there, there are more instances, Steele said. When someone climbs onto the rail right of way, CTA personnel cut power to large sections of track so that tracks are not active or electric during rescue attempts, Zusman said. There is a whole ripple effect, Zusman said. While the CTA does not track the demographics of people who come down onto the tracks, Steele said the organization hopes to reach more young people with the new campaign. Some ads parody music streaming service Spotify with fake song titles like Severe Burns, Sudden Impact and Everybody Hurts. CTA platforms rise 4 feet above track level, a distance some riders find deceivingly short, Steele said. The amount of electricity running through the tracks can be fatal, but conductivity -- factoring in conditions like clothes and the weather -- determines climbers' fate. Track shutdowns happen fast when people are spotted on the third rail, Steele said, and CTA workers are trained to climb safely onto the tracks to get riders' things if alerted. Sometimes people go down to the tracks thinking, 'I will just get my phone,' and then realize, 'I should not be here, it is difficult for me to get back up,' Steele said. Riders have been known to climb down onto CTA tracks and try to walk the rail from one station to another, Steele said. Graffiti artists are also frequent trespassers on CTA rails, accounting for 24 of recorded incidents through August 2023. Train yards at the end of the Red Line at Howard, and on the Green Line at Ashland and Midway, are graffiti hot spots, though graffiti-based climbers are most active on Orange Line tracks, Steele said. Metra struggles with similar graffiti issues, Zusman said -- though tracks at Metra train yards are not electrified. A lot of people will go into where we store our trains, typically in the nighttime, to try and graffiti a train, Steele said. When they are there, they are around live tracks. The campaign, which also features a looping audio message and a series of PSAs in the style of graphic novels, can be seen on every platform and in train cars, focusing on high-traffic stations such as Belmont, Steele said. When tracking why people trespass on CTA tracks, CTA staff rely on data collected at the scene, Zusman said. Staff are not required to follow up on police or medical examiner's reports when someone appears intoxicated, for instance. Basically we look for the signs of impairment -- any type of impairment -- and that is what is reported in our system, Zusman said. The CTA also tracks when trains collide with people or brush people while pulling into a station. Though not every contact between a train and a rider ends in injury, the CTA investigates every time it is reported by a rider or train operator or shown on security cameras, Zusman said. Though it is rare for a rail right-of-way incident to end in death, it is doubly tragic knowing that the circumstances could have been avoided, Steele said. The number of fatalities every year is extremely low compared to our ridership, Steele said. That said, one fatality is one too many.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

It might be difficult for most of us to confront, but the world is facing an unprecedented explosion in online child sexual exploitation and abuse and it is getting worse with every passing day, Julie Inman Grant, eSafety Commissioner, wrote in her report. In February, I asked Twitter (subsequently known as X), TikTok, Google (including YouTube), Discord and Twitch what steps they are taking to tackle these crimes against children playing out on their services. Their answers revealed similar troubling shortfalls and inconsistencies. For example, we found that while YouTube, TikTok and Twitch are taking steps to detect child abuse in livestreams, Discord is not, saying that implementing the required tools is 'prohibitively expensive' for its service. TikTok and Twitch use language analysis technology to detect CSEA activity such as sexual extortion across all parts of their services whereas Discord does not use any detection tools at all. Twitter uses tools on public content, but not on direct messages. Google uses tools on YouTube, but not on Chat, Gmail, Meet and Messages. Google and Discord are not blocking links to known child sexual exploitation material, despite the availability of databases from expert organisations like the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation. Google only blocks links on its search service. YouTube, TikTok and Twitch are using technology to detect grooming, whereas TwitterX, Discord and other Google services including Meet, Chat, Gmail, Messages, are not. Google is also not using its own technology to detect known child sexual exploitation videos on some of its services - Gmail, Chat and Messages. There was significant variation in the languages covered by content moderators. Google said it covers at least 71 languages and TikTok 73. In comparison Twitter said it covered only 12 languages, Twitch reported 24 and Discord report 29. This means that some of the top 5 non-English languages spoken at home in Australia are not by default covered by Twitter, Discord or Twitch moderators. This is particularly important for harms like grooming, violent extremism or hate speech which can require context and understanding of cultural nuances to identify. We also found wide variations in the response times to user reports of child abuse - TikTok says it responds within 5 minutes for public content, Twitch takes 8 minutes, while Discord takes 13 hours for direct messages. TwitterX and Google did not provide the information required. Google failed to comply by giving generic or aggregated information across multiple services where information regarding specific services was required. Google has been given a Formal Warning to deter it from future non-compliance. eSafety found that TwitterX's non-compliance was more serious. For some questions, TwitterX failed to provide any response leaving some boxes entirely blank. In other instances, Twitter provided a response that was otherwise incomplete or inaccurate. It is for this reason that TwitterX has been issued with an infringement notice of 610,500. The company now has 28 days to either request a withdrawal stating valid reasons as to why, or pay up. If in the event TwitterX does not pay, eSafety has the option to seek a civil penalty through the courts. ",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Industrial action first began in the middle of last month at the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects, after the workers' union and Chevron failed to reach an agreement on new contract terms regarding working conditions and pay. Chevron reached out to the Australian labor market regulator, the Fair Work Commission, to force the union to end the strike. Indeed, workers eventually agreed to drop the strike and restart negotiations. These, it seems, have been troubled from the start, because this month the Offshore Alliance -- the union representing the Gorgon and Wheatstone workers -- began threatening another strike. In the latest update on the situation, Reuters reported that the talks had prompted angry comments from Chevron, which has said the workers were being unreasonable. The news agency, however, cited an unnamed source as suggesting the union was not going to make concessions and Chevron would have to change its position on several issues to avoid new strikes. The union's decision to ignore the recommendation ... while discussions are continuing is very concerning, unreasonable and undermines the considerable progress made prior to Chevron requesting the Commission's assistance last week, a Chevron spokesperson told Reuters. The Gorgon project has a capacity of 15.6 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually, while the Wheatstone facility can produce 8.9 million tons annually. Together, the two account for over 5 of global LNG production capacity, and any disruption or even the suggestion of disruption of supply immediately affects global LNG prices. Right now is an especially vulnerable time for gas prices, particularly in Europe, as the reignition of violence between Israel and Hamas has prompted the shutdown of one large gas field offshore Israel, sparking fear of supply disruptions. The fear immediately pushed European gas prices higher as would any new strike action at Gorgon and Wheatstone.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The train derailed around 4:30 p.m. local time near the city of Pueblo - about 45 miles south of Colorado Springs, according to a statement from the train operator, BNSF Railway. Images of the scene posted online by the Colorado State Patrol show at least ten train cars had slid off the tracks and over the side of a bridge and nearby embankment, blanketing the ground with coal. The bridge, which extends over both lanes of the interstate, appears to be partially collapsed with a semi truck crushed underneath it. The male driver of the truck was killed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler told CNN. No other details on the victim were provided. There were no reported injuries among BNSF crew members, the rail company said. The derailment prompted interstate closures in both directions as authorities worked to clear the roadway, the state patrol said on social media. BNSF said its personnel are also assisting in clearing the site. The National Transportation Safety Board announced it is investigating the incident. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said he has communicated with Colorado Governor Jared Polis about the incident and has been briefed by the Federal Railroad and Federal Highway Administrations. US Department of Transportation staff were headed to the scene Sunday night, he said. State  local authorities are leading the immediate emergency response, and we will be ready to help in any way needed to support a swift return to normal use for the highway and rail routes affected, Buttigieg said.

The pit in the road is designed to stop people from driving into the busway. It is wide enough for small vehicles to fall into but small enough that larger ones, such as buses, can pass over it. Warning signs are in place, yet some locals are complaining that up to five drivers are still getting stuck each week. The daughter of one of these drivers, who wishes to remain anonymous, says the incident has left both her parents shaken and traumatised. Their vehicle was seriously damaged in the drop, and they are finding out if it is repairable or a write off. Read more: Cambs teacher says 'nightmare' buses because delays for students and staff Read more: Major roads in Cambridgeshire among worst in the country - Office of Rail and Road claims She claims her father was one of five drivers who ended up in the trap last week. He is in his 80s, but she insists he is a competent driver who misunderstood the exit signs leading out of a car park. She said: He somehow ended up back in the same car park again. He said the signage was poor and if he exited the same way, he would end up doing the same thing. So he went a different way and ended up in the car trap. We know of someone in their 20s who has also gone into the trap - you cannot argue this is because of my father's age. Considering the number of incidents, there must be another way to manage the junction that does not because this much damage to vehicles. Philippa Parker from Wiltshire, who drove into the trap last summer, also argues poor signposting leading up to the trap is what led to the incident. She said: The signs were totally inadequate. Motorists were driving up to the junction while we were waiting for the recovery. If we were not there, they would have made the same mistake. The abuse and awful language people were shouting as they passed us was also shocking. It left us with a very bad impression of St Ives afterwards. Cambridgeshire County Council said last month it is only aware of 60 incidents of vehicles caught in the trap since it opened 12 years ago. It also described the warnings currently in place, such as signage, as adequate. Cllr Kevin Reynolds from Cambridgeshire County Council has admitted he has little sympathy for the drivers who get stuck, stating: If people driving along that road cannot see a big hole in the ground in front of them then I would argue they would not be able to see a small child. I would question whether they should be behind the wheel at all.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Abdelnasser Rashid, during a news conference at the Muslim Community Center on Chicago's Northwest Side, Sunday,Jim Vondruska  AP An Illinois man stabbed a 6-year-old boy to death and critically wounded his mother in an alleged anti-Muslim hate crime, the Will County Sheriff's Office said Sunday, calling it a senseless and cowardly act of violence. Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The sheriff's office did not provide more corroboration, but said, despite the suspect not providing a statement to detectives, personnel were able to gather enough information through interviews and evidence to charge him with two hate crimes. This horrific act of hate has no place in America, President Joe Biden said in a statement. The child's Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek -- a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace. We join everyone here at the White House in sending our condolences and prayers to the family, including for the mother's recovery, and to the broader Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities, Biden said. The boy was stabbed 26 times at his Plainfield home by his landlord, Joseph Czuba, 71, investigators said. He later died at the hospital. His mother, 32, was stabbed more than a dozen times, authorities said, adding she is at a hospital and is expected to survive. The female victim stated that she ran into the bathroom and continued to fight off her attacker as she dialed 911, the sheriff's office said. Both the boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, and his mother were found in a bedroom when sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene. Czuba is charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and two counts of committing a hate crime. He did not make any statements to detectives regarding his involvement in this heinous attack, the sheriff's office said. It was not clear whether he had legal counsel. The county public defender's office and district attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wadea loved soccer and basketball, and he had just celebrated his sixth birthday, Ahmed Rehab, the president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said at a news conference Sunday. And he paid the price for the atmosphere of hate and authorization and dehumanization that, frankly, I think we are seeing here in the United States, Rehab said. CAIR said the boy's mother, Hanaan Shahin, shared text messages with the organization that she had sent t the boy's father from the hospital, detailing anti-Muslim statements made during the attack.

But it was fleeting, as airstrikes rained down on Gaza, and he confronted the uncertainty of whether he, his wife, Najla, and their two daughters would be able to flee. The translator's wife and children still do not have YOU.S. passports, and he is received no official word to indicate that the border will actually be opening. And even if it does, he said, it is highly risky to travel amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza strip. There are no guarantees. There is not like a safe corridor offered to foreign nationals when they leave, it is every man for himself, Shawa, who is staying in a small two-room cabin in central Gaza, approximately 40 minutes from the border, with his family and 50 neighbors after they had to evacuate their homes. Mai Abushaban, a Palestinian American, is also fearful. She said that her mother and sister would attempt to cross into Egypt Monday. They became trapped in Gaza while visiting her sick grandfather. If it is true and it is open they are going to go, Abushaban, a 22-year-old Houston native said, referencing the lack of details from the embassy or state department that led to false hopes last week. We are hoping it is for real this time. But late Sunday night, Abushaban received an email from the YOU.S. Embassy in Jerusalem stating that they anticipate the situation at the Rafah crossing will remain fluid and unpredictable and it is unclear whether, or for how long, travelers will be permitted to transit the crossing. The message has left Abushaban feeling worried that it might not work out like when they tried to cross days ago -- but still hopeful. Up to 600 Americans remain in Gaza, according to the State Department, amid an increasing humanitarian crisis as clean water, food, fuel, and medical supplies dwindle. There has not been electricity in the territory for days, after the Israeli government established a blockade in retaliation for Hamas' brutal terror attack. More than 2,450 people have been killed in Gaza and 9,200 have been injured. In Israel, 1,400 people have been killed and 3,500 have been wounded. The death toll for Americans from Hamas' attack on Israel and the subsequent war stands at 30, a State Department spokesperson said today. A series of automated emails from the State Department and inconclusive phone calls have left Palestinian Americans dubious about the likelihood of them safely getting out. Since the war broke out between Israel and Hamas, the Rafah crossing has been closed and has also sustained physical damage from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. Asked Sunday on NBC News if there will be no shelling near the crossing as people try to leave and humanitarian assistance comes in, Israel Defense Force IDF Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said, it is very much up to Hamas to decide if they are going to allow and what is going to happen. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Rafah crossing will be opened for YOU.S. citizens and their immediate family members but provided no details on timing to reporters in Cairo on Sunday. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Embassy of Palestine representative told NBC News that the Rafah crossing said foreign national Palestinians will be able to cross the border starting 9 a.m. local time. Shawa, who was born in Seattle to a Palestinian father and American mother, said the YOU.S. government is not offering any other tangible assistance to citizens in Gaza other than orchestrating the opening of the Rafah crossing. Cairo is an arduous six to eight hour drive from the border crossing, through the Sinai peninsula and through several Egyptian military checkpoints. The double standard Abushaban, who has crossed the Rafah border 10 times during past trips to visit family in Gaza, said opening up the border does not necessarily guarantee passage through it. There are two parts to the land crossing -- first, a security check manned by the Palestinian authority and then a bus ride to the Egyptian-controlled part of the border. She said usually the Egyptian side is chaotic with long wait times. If anything goes wrong from point A to point B they will turn the buses around and turn everyone back without any notice, she said of her previous experiences crossing the border. The long drive to Cairo from Gaza is risky, with multiple military checkpoints along the Sinai. The first automated email Abushaban received from the State Department on Tuesday included information on how Americans in Israel would be evacuated, but the messaging for those in Gaza was not as helpful. Given the dynamic security situation in Gaza, YOU.S. citizens should assess their own security when deciding whether to travel. YOU.S. government personnel are not able to travel to Gaza or the Gaza periphery to assist at this time, the email, reviewed by NBC News, read. The State Department then followed up a couple days later acknowledging their most recent message, sent to a large list of YOU.S. citizens located in Gaza and Israel, may not be applicable to you because it detailed options for Americans in Israel who have access to Ben Gurion airport -- something those in Gaza do not have. The email added that the state department was working on solutions but the situation is incredibly complex. It is very frustrating for me as someone with one foot in Palestine and one foot in the United States, Abushaban said, referring to the State Department's communications. The State Department saying that Americans in Israel will be evacuating them via boat and plane to either Germany, Cyprus or Greece, and that Palestinians in Gaza should just kind of, you know, wait, she added. Emilee Rauschenberger, who was in Khan Yunis with her husband and five children visiting her in-laws when the war started, echoed Abushaban's sentiments of feeling neglected as an American citizen in Gaza by the YOU.S. government. I feel the government kind of feels absolved of it as a responsibility, because of the politics of it all, Rauschenberger said, adding that she does not feel there is been an attempt to save American lives in Gaza. The double standard is incredibly harsh, Rauschenberger said. Blinken has been on a days-long tour of the Middle East where he is met with leaders from Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar. The effort was meant to prevent the war against Israel and Hamas from spreading and to encourage Israel to not target civilians. Second-class citizens For Palestinian-Americans, the lack of guidance from the YOU.S. government cements a feeling they say they are familiar with. Palestinian Americans are almost like, I personally feel like we were treated as second class citizens in the country where we hold citizenship, and, you know, just as lawfully as anyone else, Abushaban said. Shawa said that over the years living in Gaza with his family, he has never felt prioritized by the YOU.S. government. I mean, Gaza. has to 2.2 or 3 million citizens the vast majority of us are not affiliated to Hamas or any other political, Palestinian faction, Shawa said referring to YOU.S. politicians speaking about Gaza as if it is a hamas block. We have children, we go to schools, we have birthdays, we have restaurants, we have, I mean, everything that makes up a normal community, Shawa said. His eldest daughter, Zayneb, turned 9 on Sunday. They found some kind of, you know, packaged doughnut-y thingy and stuck a candle in it and sang 'Happy Birthday,' Shawa said, referring to the impromptu gesture some of the children organized for her. For Shawa, attempting to cross the border with his family is not only dangerous, but emotionally taxing, and could mean they will never see their loved ones again. I mean, we are with people, friends, neighbors, relatives, who do not have this privilege, Shawa said. It is really, really, really hard to make the decision to leave them behind.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Moscow's forces lost eight tanks, 25 APVs and 33 artillery systems in the past day, Ukraine's General Staff said on Sunday. The Independent cannot independently confirm Kyiv's numbers which come after Putin claimed Ukraine's counteroffensive completely failed. As for the counteroffensive, which is allegedly stalling, it has failed completely, Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. Russia currently controls about 17.5 of Ukrainian territory and a four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive this year has resulted in almost no net territorial gains. Key Points Putin says Ukraine's counteroffensive failed completely Sunday 15 October 2023 09:39 , Sam Rkaina Vladimir Putin has branded Ukraine's counteroffensive a failure. While Kyiv took back territory taken by Russia last year, the Ukrainian army has struggled to penetrate Russian lines which have been bolstered with minefields and thousands of extra troops. As for the counteroffensive, which is allegedly stalling, it has failed completely, Mr Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. The opposing side is preparing new active offensive operations. We see it and we know it, he added when asked about the battle for the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. According to the Belfer Center at Harvard, Ukraine made a net gain of 8 square miles of territory the month to 10 October. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces. Russia bombards Sumy Oblast but no Ukraine casualties 04:27 , Barney Davis Ninety-three explosions were reported in Sumy Oblast on Sunday according to Governor Volodymyr Artiukh. Artiukh noted that, as a result of Russian shelling in the region, civilian infrastructure and homes were damaged. No casualties were reported. Enemy military aircraft, kamikaze drones, artillery systems, and salvo fire systems were used, he said. Over the past month of (Russian) shelling, seven civilians have died in our region, including a 13-year-old girl. Many wounded. Artiukh added that there are currently over 5,000 homes in Sumy Oblast that have been damaged by Russian shelling. Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia, has been targeted by Russian forces on a near-daily basis since April 2022. Russian shelling killed a 58-year-old woman and wounded a 26-year-old man in Donetsk Oblast, the media outlet Suspilne reported. The woman was killed in her garden when shells struck her home in the city of Avdiivka. A man was taken to the hospital with a concussion, fracture and shrapnel wounds for medical treatment. According to preliminary data, the Russian army shelled both settlements with artillery, regional spokesperson Anastasia Medvedeva said. Russian attacks on Ukraine over a 24-hour period killed six people, local officials reported Sunday. 02:24 , Barney Davis Two people were killed and three more injured in the Kherson area after more than 100 shells bombarded the region over the weekend, local governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on social media. Two guided bombs later hit key infrastructure in Kherson city, sparking a partial blackout and disruption to the area's water supply, reported the head of the city's military administration, Roman Mrochko. Local officials said two more people died in the Donetsk area and that a 57-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were killed by an airstrike that destroyed their home in the Kharkiv region. In a separate incident, a 14-year-old boy was killed by a mine in a field in Ukraine's Mykolaiv region, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said. The explosion also injured another 12-year-old boy. Fighting remained fierce across eastern Ukraine over the weekend, with Russian forces repeatedly attempting to encircle the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, military officials said. Russian governer underfire for saying army unprepared for Ukraine war Monday 16 October 2023 00:30 , Barney Davis A Russian governor was accused by critics on Sunday of discrediting Russia's armed forces after telling residents in her region that the country had no need for its war in Ukraine. Natalya Komarova, the governor of the Khanty-Mansiysk region and a member of President Vladimir Putin's governing United Russia party, made the remarks during a meeting with residents in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk on Saturday. Critics have called for authorities to launch an investigation into her remarks, but Komarova has not been detained or faced any charges so far. A video of the event posted on social media showed the politician being confronted by the wife of a Russian soldier who said that mobilized men had been poorly equipped for the front line. Are you asking me (why your husband does not have equipment), knowing that I am the governor and not the minister of defence?, the 67-year-old said. As a whole, we did not prepare for this war. We do not need it. We were building a completely different world, so in this regard, there will certainly be some inconsistencies and unresolved issues, she said. President Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing this week in a rare visit from the Russian leader. During Tuesday's trip to Beijing, Putin will attend a forum marking 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's global infrastructure program that has helped boost its influence worldwide. China and Russia declared a no limits partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two. Washington and Brussels have been eyeing with alarm the relationship between China and Russia, with Beijing refusing to condemn Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as it has voiced support for the principle of territorial integrity. Over the past decade, Xi has built with Putin's Russia the most consequential undeclared alliance in the world, Graham Allison, professor at Harvard University and a former assistant secretary of defence under Bill Clinton, told Reuters. The YOU.S. will have to come to grips with the inconvenient fact that a rapidly rising systemic rival and a revanchist one-dimensional superpower with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world are tightly aligned in opposing the USA. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that the Biden administration hopes to push a new weapons package for Israel and Ukraine through Congress that will be significantly higher than 2 billion. Sullivan, in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation, said YOU.S. President Joe Biden will have intensive talks with the YOU.S. Congress this week on the need for the package to be approved. Asked whether the request would be for 2 billion, as has been previously reported, Sullivan said: The number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat. Some Republicans have already said they would not back any Israel aid package that also contains aid for Ukraine. Ukraine working to evacuate 260 citizens from Gaza and Israel Sunday 15 October 2023 21:26 , Barney Davis Ukraine is working to evacuate nearly 260 of its citizens from Gaza and to fly other Ukrainians out of Israel, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Sunday. Ukraine's embassy in Israel said on social media on Saturday that 207 Ukrainian citizens, including 63 children, were evacuated from Tel Aviv to Romania on Saturday and that another flight would take 155 people to Romania on Sunday. Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said three parties would have to approve the departure of Ukrainians from Gaza, complicating the process. The Palestinians need to release all Ukrainian citizens, Egypt to accept them, and Israel should not conduct any operation at this time, so that the crossing point would be safe, he said in remarks televised on Sunday. Russian governor reported to police for there is 'no need' for the war in Ukraine Sunday 15 October 2023 21:15 , Alexander Butler A Russian governor was accused by critics of discrediting Russia's armed forces after telling residents in her region that the country had no need for its war in Ukraine.Natalya Komarova, the governor of the Khanty-Mansiysk region and a member of President Vladimir Putin's governing United Russia party, made the remarks during a meeting with residents in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk on Saturday.Critics have called for authorities to launch an investigation into her remarks, but Komarova has not been detained or faced any charges so far. Russian forces 'bolster' positions across Ukraine Sunday 15 October 2023 20:15 , Alexander Butler Russian forces have bolstered their positions across the Ukrainian frontline, Vladimir Putin claimed. He said troops had been improving their position in a vast area in an interview on Russian television, which was posted on social media. On Saturday, Kyiv reported heated fighting around Avdiivka Saturday, saying Russian forces had not stopped assaulting it for days in their attempt to surround it. What is happening now along the entire length of the line of contact is called 'an active defence'. And our troops are improving their position at almost entire area. Quite a large area, Putin said. Putin: US seeking war with Russia and China is 'nonsense' Sunday 15 October 2023 19:15 , Alexander Butler Russian president Vladimir Putin said suggestions the US is preparing for a simultaneous war against Russia and China were nonsense. I do not think these are healthy thoughts in the minds of healthy people, because to say that the United States is preparing for war with Russia, well we are all preparing for war because we follow the ancient principle: if you want peace, get ready for war, he said. But we want peace, Putin said with a chuckle. Moreover, to fight with both Russia and China, it is nonsense - I do not think it is serious. I think they are just scaring each other. British artillery guns are not used due to shortage of ammunition Ukrainian soldiers can only use L119 howitzers less than one a day because of the catastrophic shortage of ammunition used for them. The British L119 is a nice gun, very comfortable to work with and accurate to fire. But we do not have enough shells for it - last week, we fired only five shells all week. It is catastrophically limited. When we are in battle, we are having to weigh up very carefully whether we should use a she will or not, an artillery commander told The Telegraph. Putin says Ukraine's counteroffensive failed completely Today, Vladimir Putin branded Ukraine's counteroffensive a failure. As for the counteroffensive, which is allegedly stalling, it has failed completely, Mr Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. The opposing side is preparing new active offensive operations. We see it and we know it, he added when asked about the battle for the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. US says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to Russia The White House said North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday that a new weapons package for Israel and Ukraine would be significantly higher than 2bn. In an interview on CBS's Face the Nation, said Sullivan said Joe Biden would have extensive talks with the US Congress this week on the need for the package to be approved. Asked whether the request would be for 2 billion, Sullivan said: Well, the number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat. British artillery guns are not used due to shortage of ammunition Sunday 15 October 2023 15:38 , Alexander Butler British artillery guns provided to Ukraine are not being used on the battlefield due to a lack of ammunition, troops have claimed. Ukrainian soldiers can only use L119 howitzers less than one a day because of the catastrophic shortage of ammunition used for them. The British L119 is a nice gun, very comfortable to work with and accurate to fire. But we do not have enough shells for it - last week, we fired only five shells all week. It is catastrophically limited. When we are in battle, we are having to weigh up very carefully whether we should use a she will or not, an artillery commander told The Telegraph. US says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to Russia Sunday 15 October 2023 14:10 , Sam Rkaina President Zelensky's international aid comes after the White House said North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. On Friday White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's nuclear program. Ukraine boosted by military aid from multiple countries this week, Zelensky says Sunday 15 October 2023 13:24 , Sam Rkaina Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has been boosted with military aid from a number of countries this week. In a video statement on Twitter, he said: This week has strengthened Ukraine. I am grateful to all of our partners who have provided new military aid packages. Air defence, artillery, drones, armored vehicles, and other items. The world understands what Russia is planning and what terrorist attacks it is capable of carrying out. We also know how to respond to the occupier's actions. And we will respond forcefully. In an era when terror is spreading over the world, it is vital that the world sends a message that is crystal clear: protection from terror will not falter anywhere. Madonna shows support for Ukraine as she returns to the stage in London Sunday 15 October 2023 12:15 , Sam Rkaina Madonna has shown support for Ukraine on the opening night of her Celebration Tour in London on Saturday night. The singer draped a Ukraine flag over her back before launching into Do not Cry for Me Argentina. Weeks after a health scare, the 65 year-old performed at the O2, treating thousands of adoring fans to more than 40 songs from her four-decade career, a host of extravagant outfits and a variety of theatrical stage set-ups. Russia building new railway line to speed up supplies Sunday 15 October 2023 11:24 , Sam Rkaina Russia is building a new railway line to Mariupol to reduce travel times to the Zaporizhzhia front, the Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily update on the war in Ukraine, the MoD said: Rail logistics continue to be a vital component in sustaining Russia's invasion. Russia uses its rail networks to move ammunition, armour, fuel and personnel into Ukraine. Russian forces are conducting an 'active defence' and have been able to improve their positions at almost entire line of contact in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday. What is happening now along the entire length of the line of contact is called 'an active defence', Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. And our troops are improving their position at almost entire area. Quite a large area. Two civilians killed in Russian assaults on Avdiivka Sunday 15 October 2023 08:00 , Lydia Patrick Two civilians were killed in Russian attacks on the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka on Saturday, according to the Donetsk region administration. In one of its few offensives in months, Russia's military pressed on for a fifth day with assaults on Avdiivka, with shelling so fierce that emergency crews were unable to recover the dead from wrecked buildings. The administration of the Donetsk region said on Sunday on the Telegram messaging app that one more person was injured elsewhere in the region. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Sunday its forces had repelled 15 Russian attacks near Avdiivka, Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region, while Russian forces launched heavy air strikes in the area. Oleh Sinehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region also in Ukraine's east, said on Sunday a 54-year-old woman and a 57-year-old man were killed and one woman injured in an overnight Russian air attack. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet Xi Jinping in China this week, marking only his second visit outside former USSR since the start of the war in Ukraine. The Russian president will be attending the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on 17, 18 October. This would also be Mr Putin's first trip outside of former USSR since Hague-based International Criminal Court issued a warrant for him in March over the deportation of children from Ukraine. Russia's Black Sea Fleet conducts drills in Crimea Sunday 15 October 2023 06:45 , Vishwam Sankaran Russia's Black Sea Fleet is conducting drills using rocket launchers off the Crimean-port Sevastopol. Everything is calm in the city, the Crimean-port's Russian-installed governor said today in a post on the Telegram messaging app. It is known that Russia's Black Sea Fleet launches many of its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine from the Black Sea. Russia's Black Sea Fleet has doubled down on defence measures after suffering setbacks in the recent months, according to the UK Defense Ministry. Since suffering a series of strikes in August and September, the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) has highly likely doubled down on its defensive and reactive posture, the Defense Ministry said yesterday. Ukraine has gained the initiative in the northwest Black Sea since June launching unmanned surface vessels, unmanned air vehicles, and missile attacks against Russia's Black Sea Fleet. The Russian fleet has mostly continued to defend itself while also launching missiles into Ukraine, which it can almost certainly continue to do so from the eastern (region of the) Black Sea, the UK Defense Ministry said. More than two dozen drones launched from Ukraine have reportedly been destroyed over Kursk and other Russian regions. About 18 of these were downed over Kursk in southern Russia and two where destroyed over Belgorod, another region bordering Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said early today. Kursk governor Roman Starovoit said there were no casualties in the drone attack, Reuters reported. Third of Ukrainian territory unsafe due to mines, Zelensky says Sunday 15 October 2023 04:14 , Vishwam Sankaran Nearly a third of Ukrainian territory is unsafe due to mines and unexploded ordinance, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday. Demining and clearing of explosive materials were issues discussed at a two-day conference in Croatia in October. About 250 people have reportedly been killed by mines so far in Ukraine, and over 500 have been injured. More than 40 countries took part in the conference in Croatia, and jointly pledged about 500 million euros (530 million) to assist in demining Russia's Black Sea Fleet has moved a number of its 'prestige assets' following a series of strikes by Ukraine in August and September, the Ministry of Defence has said. In it is daily update on progress on the war, the MoD said cruise missile capable ships and submarines had been relocated from Sevastopol to bases further east. The risk of further military losses and the dire political consequences of Russian naval forces overtly attacking merchant shipping would highly likely outweigh any gain from attempting to enforce a blockade of Ukrainian-bound trade. Ukrainian officials have said assaults being carried out by Russian forces are relentless, as the ongoing attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka entered its fifth day. The enemy has not stopped either assaulting or shelling positions around Avdiivka, city head Vitalii Barabash said on Ukrainian television. Barabash also reported that Moscow was deploying additional forces to encircle the strategically important city in the eastern Donetsk region, situated just north of the Moscow-held regional capital, also called Donetsk. Around 1,600 civilians remain within the city, a stark contrast to its prewar population of about 31,000. Barabash's comments came after Russia's YOU.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told a YOU.N. Security Council meeting on Friday that the intensified attacks in the east amounted to a new stage in Moscow's campaign in Ukraine. Russian troops have, for several days now, switched over to active combat action practically throughout the entire front line -- The so-called Ukrainian counteroffensive can therefore be considered finished, he said. Ukraine has said they have uncovered more than 700,000 explosive objects in the country. Sappers surveyed more than 152,000 hectares looking for potentially deadly devices. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine posted a video of their efforts on X on Saturday morning. An 11 year-old boy has reportedly been killed in a Russian attack on a Ukraine village. The child died during a rocket strike against the village of Bahatyr, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's National Police said on Saturday. His brother, six, and their mother, 31, were also injured in the blast, the Kyiv Independent reported. Fighting in east significantly worsened, Kyiv warns Saturday 14 October 2023 10:44 , Sam Rkaina Fighting along the northern portion of Ukraine's eastern front has significantly worsened in recent days, the commander of Kyiv's ground forces said on Saturday. Oleksandr Syrskyi, who was visiting Ukrainian troops in the area, said Russian forces had regrouped after suffering losses and were attacking around the village of Makiivka and towards the city of Kupiansk. The main objective of the enemy is the defeat of a grouping of our troops, the encirclement of Kupiansk and to reach the Oskil River, he said in comments carried by an official military platform. Syrskyi added that Russian forces were carrying out dozens of assaults each day, but that Ukrainian troops had been ready and were holding their ground. The development comes as Kremlin forces were also pummelling the strategic Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, on a different section of the eastern front, in what Russian and Western officials said amounted to a new offensive. A four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive has made some progress in both the east, near Bakhmut, and in the south, where Kyiv hopes to reach the Sea of Azov, but gains have been incremental. Updated map shows latest situation on the ground Saturday 14 October 2023 10:16 , Sam Rkaina The Ministry of Defence has posted a new map showing the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine. The UK's MoD shared the image on Friday, highlighting two likely Ukrainian advances in Bakhmut in the east and Orikhiv in the south. US 'confident Ukraine will beat back new Russian offensive' Saturday 14 October 2023 09:00 , Sam Rkaina In Washington, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Russian action amounted to a new offensive, showing that Russia was in no way ready to give up its campaign. But the United States, he said, was confident that the Ukrainian military would beat back Russian forces. Military analyst Serhiy Zgurets, writing on the Espreso TV website, said Avdiivka had withstood Russian attacks in 2014, when Russian-financed separatists had seized large chunks of Ukrainian territory. The area had since been fortified. All Russian attacks have resulted in significant losses for them, he wrote. Russia's representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzia, said the intensified battles in the east signified a new stage in its campaign. Russian troops have, for several days now, switched over to active combat action practically throughout the entire front line, Nebenzia told a session of the YOU.N. Security Council. The so-called Ukrainian counteroffensive can therefore be considered finished. Russian forces pound Avdiivka for fourth day in row Saturday 14 October 2023 08:01 , Sam Rkaina Russian forces pounded the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka for the fourth day in a row on Friday, a new offensive in Putin's 19-month-old invasion. In attacks elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian missile strike killed one person in the city of Pokrovsk, also in the east, while a drone attack in the south killed a women and seriously injured her husband. In Avdiivka, known for its large coking plant in Ukraine's Donbas industrial heartland, officials said the Russian assaults had left the already-gutted city in flames. The fighting has been going on for four consecutive days, Vitaliy Barabash, head of the city's military administration, told Ukrainian national television. They have substantial reserves of personnel and equipment. Avdiivka is completely ablaze. They shoot, using everything they have. The hospital is again under fire, as are administrative buildings and our volunteer centre. White House warns Israel crisis is stretching its ability to support Ukraine: 'Running out of runway' Saturday 14 October 2023 06:00 , Joe Middleton The White House said it was running out of runway on supporting both Ukraine and Israel as US Republican lawmakers warned they would protest any funding request for military aid from the Biden administration for the two crisis-hit nations. I think in the immediate term, right now, we can continue to support - with the authorities in the appropriations we have - Israel and Ukraine. But, you know, we are ... certainly running out of runway, said John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. White House warns Israel crisis is stretching its ability to support Ukraine Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka: 'The enemy does not stop' Saturday 14 October 2023 05:00 , Joe Middleton The Ukrainian military continues to hold its ground in the face of Russia's relentless assault on the eastern city of Avdiivka, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as the battle intensified for a third day. Russia has moved a large armoured column of three battalions, including some 2,000 troops, dozens of armoured vehicles and jets into the northern flank of the Avdiivka front for what has been described as the biggest military offensive in months. The Ukrainian forces said they had repelled more than 20 attacks by the Russian army in Avdiivka and the surrounding regions in the past 24 hours, in what was described as a blow to Moscow's attempts to use the offensive to show that the tide of the war was turning in its favour. Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia, says White House Saturday 14 October 2023 04:00 , Joe Middleton The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's nuclear programme. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. Putin makes first trip abroad since international arrest warrant issued over Ukraine invasion Mr Putin arrived in the central Asian nation on Thursday for a two-day state visit for bilateral meetings and a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the founding of Russia's Kant military airbase outside Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. The Kremlin chief has rarely taken trips abroad since he launched what he called a special military operation in Ukraine in early 2022 and is not known to have stepped out of Russia since the ICC warrant was issued.

Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka IOC bans Russian Olympic Committee for including annexed Ukraine territories Saturday 14 October 2023 01:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Russia has been suspended by the Olympic authorities with immediate effect after it tried to include four regions in eastern Ukraine under its sporting jurisdiction. The land grab in sports administration saw Russia's Olympic officials announce last week that they were accepting the local sports councils of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia as new members. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Russia's suspension saying the move by the Russian Olympic Committee was a breach of the Olympic Charter, a set of rules and principles for international sports bodies. The suspension will not have any immediate effect on Russians who are in line to compete at international events as neutral athletes, such as in qualifying stages for next year's Paris Olympics. IOC bans Russian Olympic Committee for including annexed territories Russia hit 6 ships, 150 port facilities, destroyed 300,000 T of grain -Kyiv government Saturday 14 October 2023 00:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed over 300,000 tonnes of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels had been already loaded with grain for exports and used a new humanitarian grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. Russia destroyed 300,000 tons of grain since July in port, ship attacks Friday 13 October 2023 23:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Russia has destroyed almost 300,000 metric tons of grain since July in attacks on Ukraine's port facilities and on ships, the Ukrainian government said on Friday, underscoring the war's threat to global food security. In summer, Moscow quit a YOU.N.-brokered deal that had allowed exports of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea safely. Since then, Russian forces have hit six civilian ships and 150 port and grain facilities during 17 attacks, destroying crops headed for export, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said in a statement. This is Russia's attempt to deepen the food crisis in the countries which depend on Ukrainian products, Kubrakov said. The damage on Ukrainian ports reduced the country's grain export potential by 40, he said. Russia has attacked port facilities on both the Black Sea and Danube River. Ukraine is one of the world's largest wheat and corn exporters. The Russian Defence Ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. Kubrakov said 21 grain-loaded vessels have already used a new humanitarian grain corridor in the Black Sea that Kyiv established in August. He said that under the previous YOU.N. Black Sea Grain Initiative, Ukraine had exported 33 million tonnes of grain, with 60 of that shipped to African and Asian countries. US says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to Russia for Ukraine war Friday 13 October 2023 21:38 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine.Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program.The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia.

Britain to boost military presence in Northern Europe Friday 13 October 2023 17:35 , Joe Middleton Britain said it planned to step up its military presence in Northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) defence cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Britain said in a statement it would send 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines and air men and women plus eight Royal Navy ships and a group of fast jets and military helicopters to help police and deter threats from Russia. Britain said they would take part in large-scale, multi-country exercises, and carry out air policing and cold weather training. JEF, a defence cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to outside activity, stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent, Sunak said in a statement.

Zelenskiy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are vital to ensuring budget revenues following a surge in defence spending following Russia's invasion last year. Today we had a busy day in your beautiful city of Odesa, which was dedicated to global and security issues, Zelenskiy told a joint press conference with Rutte. We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole... The Odesa region has came under frequent Russian missile and drone attacks, and Zelenskiy and Rutte visited a damaged port. Zelenskiy described the air strikes as vile tactics and thanked Rutte for a new air defence package, which would include missiles for Patriot air defence systems and patrol ships. The Netherlands has provided Ukraine with financial aid and weapons during the war, and has led efforts to help train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. The fate of anyone who returns to Russia from abroad depends on how they have behaved, President Vladimir Putin said when asked about the future of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Fridman was reported to have returned to Russia this week for the first time since the start of the Ukraine conflict. Russian senator Dmitry Rogozin has asked investigators to check reports of possible funding of the Ukrainian armed forces by Fridman. If someone has behaved immorally and returns, they will feel it, Putin told reporters. Britain to boost military presence in Northern Europe Friday 13 October 2023 15:29 , Tara Cobham Britain said it planned to step up its military presence in Northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage.

One person was killed and 13 wounded by a missile strike on the city of Pokrovsk in the eastern region of Donetsk, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said, citing preliminary information. Emergency services said two administrative buildings had been damaged. A 34-year-old woman was killed and her 36-year-old husband seriously injured in a drone strike on their vehicle in the town of Beryslav in the southern Kherson region, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on the Telegram messaging app. A 79-year-old woman who was standing nearby was also hurt, he said. This is a deliberate hunt for civilians, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, said on Telegram. Reuters could not independently verify the information. Russia has denied deliberately targeting civilians although many have been killed in attacks across Ukraine. Ukrainians may be among Hamas hostages, according to reports Friday 13 October 2023 12:00 , Tara Cobham Ukrainian citizens may be among those being held hostage by Hamas, it has been reported. Ukraine's Ambassador to Israel Yevhen Korniychuk said Israeli authorities believe it is possible that Ukrainians were taken by the militants, although there is no concrete information yet, reported The Kyiv Independent. Recap: White House warns Israel stretching ability to support Ukraine I think in the immediate term, right now, we can continue to support - with the authorities in the appropriations we have - Israel and Ukraine. But, you know, we are ... certainly running out of runway, said John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. Mr Kirby was answering a question at a daily briefing on the administration meeting the immediate needs of Ukraine and Israel along with the continuing fight to elect a House Speaker. Arpan Rai reports: White House warns Israel crisis is stretching its ability to support Ukraine Ukraine hit two Russian vessels, says intelligence source Friday 13 October 2023 11:25 , Tara Cobham Ukraine struck a Russian missile carrier and a patrol ship in separate attacks this week involving sea-borne drones carrying experimental weapons, a Ukrainian intelligence source said on Friday. The source gave no details of the damage but said the Buyan missile carrier was attacked on Friday and the Pavel Derzhavin missile carrier was attacked on Wednesday in joint operations carried out by the Ukrainian Security Service and naval forces. After the first detonation, Russian minesweepers and divers were unable to discover our know-how, the source told Reuters. The Buyan missile carrier... was struck today on the Sevastopol route by experimental weapons on 'Sea Babies' (naval drones). Reuters could not immediately verify the reports independently. Anton Gerashchenko, Advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, is among those who have on Friday posted footage on social media, which is suggested to show smoke emerging from a Russian vessel in the roadstead of Sevastopol, Crimea. Russia continues to pummel Avdiivka in fourth day of fighting Friday 13 October 2023 11:19 , Tara Cobham Russian forces pummelled the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka from the ground and air on Friday, the fourth day of intense fighting in the biggest offensive by Russian forces in months. Ukraine said its forces were holding their ground but Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka's military administration, said the town was under constant attack from air, artillery and large numbers of troops. The battles have been going on for four days now. Fierce and really non-stop ... They are firing from everything they have available, Barabash said in televised comments. It was a very hot night in Avdiivka. There were several air strikes on the city itself ... the attacks do not stop day or night. The attack on Avdiivka is one of the few big assaults Russia has mounted since Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in early June to try to drive out Russian troops occupying large swathes of territory in the east and south. Russia will never be seen as reliable energy supplier, US energy official says Friday 13 October 2023 10:45 , Tara Cobham US Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources Geoffrey Pyatt said on Friday Russia would never again be viewed as a reliable energy supplier, a day after Washington imposed fresh sanctions on Moscow because of its war in Ukraine. Speaking at an online briefing ahead of next week's US-Japan Energy Security Dialogue, Pyatt also said the United States and its partners in the Group of 7 were committed to denying Russia any energy revenues. The United States on Thursday imposed the first sanctions on owners of tankers carrying Russian oil priced above the G7's price cap of 60 a barrel, in an effort to close loopholes in the mechanism. It is very clear to me that Russia is never again going to be viewed as a reliable energy supplier, Pyatt told reporters. In the case of our G7 partners in particular, we are also committed to work jointly to deny Russia future energy revenues, and target in particular investments and projects growing Russia's future energy revenue, he added. Putin makes first trip abroad since arrest warrant issued Friday 13 October 2023 10:00 , Tara Cobham Russian president Vladimir Putin is visiting Kyrgyzstan for his first trip abroad since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him over war crimes in Ukraine. Mr Putin arrived in the central Asian nation on Thursday for a two-day state visit for bilateral meetings and a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the founding of Russia's Kant military airbase outside Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. The Kremlin chief has rarely taken trips abroad since he launched what he called a special military operation in Ukraine in early 2022 and is not known to have stepped out of Russia since the ICC warrant was issued. Shweta Sharma reports: Putin makes first trip abroad since international arrest warrant issued Ukraine says its forces are holding their ground around Avdiivka Friday 13 October 2023 09:20 , Tara Cobham Ukrainian troops are holding their ground near the eastern town of Avdiivka in heavy fighting against Russian forces, the head of the president's office said on Friday. Andriy Yermak said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian forces were holding their positions in difficult fighting despite a large number of Russian reinforcements. One killed and 12 hurt in Russian attack on Ukraine's Pokrovsk Friday 13 October 2023 08:54 , Tara Cobham One person was killed and 12 wounded in a Russian attack on the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine on Friday, emergency services said. The emergency services said in a statement that two administrative buildings had been damaged as a result of the attack and three people had been rescued from under rubble. Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka Friday 13 October 2023 08:37 , Tara Cobham The Ukrainian military continues to hold its ground in the face of Russia's relentless assault on the eastern city of Avdiivka, Volodymyr Zelensky, as the battle intensified for a third day. Russia has moved a large armoured column of three battalions, including some 2,000 troops, dozens of armoured vehicles and jets into the northern flank of the Avdiivka front for what has been described as the biggest military offensive in months. The Ukrainian forces said they repelled more than 20 attacks by the Russian army in Avdiivka and the surrounding regions in the past 24 hours, in what was described as a blow to Moscow's attempts to use the offensive to show the tide of the war turning in its favour. Shweta Sharma reports: Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka Four Dutch companies fined for helping Russia build Crimea bridge Friday 13 October 2023 08:15 , Tara Cobham The Dutch prosecutor has penalised four Dutch companies and eight people for breaching EU sanctions on Russia between 2014 and 2017 for helping Moscow build a bridge to Crimea, it said in a statement on Friday. The eight people were sentenced to community service ranging from 20 to 60 hours while the companies paid fines totalling 160,000 euros (169,000). The companies involved supplied machines, machine parts and other services for the construction of the 19 kilometre (11.8 mile) long bridge spanning the Strait of Kerch, the prosecutor's office said. The Crimean bridge was built partly due to the use of Dutch knowledge and expertise, it added. By committing the sanction violations, one company benefited from supplying the prohibited goods and services. This illegally obtained benefit amounting to 71,330 euros has been confiscated by the Dutch prosecutor. The prosecutors' office did not name the companies involved. IOC bans Russian Olympic Committee over annexed territories Friday 13 October 2023 08:04 , Tara Cobham Russia has been suspended by the Olympic authorities with immediate effect after it tried to include four regions in eastern Ukraine under its sporting jurisdiction. The land grab in sports administration saw Russia's Olympic officials announce last week that they were accepting the local sports councils of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia as new members. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Russia's suspension saying the move by the Russian Olympic Committee was a breach of the Olympic Charter, a set of rules and principles for international sports bodies. Shweta Sharma reports: French police probe 'poisoning' of journalist who denounced war Friday 13 October 2023 08:03 , Tara Cobham French police are investigating the suspected poisoning of a Russian state TV journalist who denounced Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine live on air and later fell suddenly ill. Marina Ovsyannikova, who escaped Russia after her on-air protest and settled in France, reported feeling suddenly ill as she left her Paris apartment and was hospitalised after she called emergency services. She said she suspected she was poisoned, the Paris prosecutor's office said, adding that they were examining her apartment and an investigation was underway. Shweta Sharma reports: French police probe 'poisoning' of journalist who denounced Putin's war live on TV Russia's 'exhausted' troops 'suffer significant losses in key town Avdiivka' Friday 13 October 2023 07:47 , Tara Cobham Russian troops are exhausted after suffering significant losses following their major attack on the key Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, a US war think tank has said. Russian and Ukrainian forces fought fierce battles around the strategically important eastern town for a third day after Moscow launched one of its biggest military offensives in months. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on Thursday that Vladimir Putin's troops are subsequently exhausted, according to Russian Vostok Battalion Commander Alexander Khodakovsky, who is now even advocating for Russian forces to freeze the frontlines in Ukraine in order to make replacements. The ISW added that, in the face of relentless attacks, Ukrainian forces have managed to destroy at least 36 Russian armoured vehicles, including tanks, according to a Ukrainian reserve officer. Avdiivka is described as a gateway to the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Donbas region, and has become a symbol of resistance since Russia's invasion. The village of Velyka Novosilka, in the south of the Donetsk region has been almost reduced to ruins: A recap: Vladimir Putin has told Russian lawmakers to find how best to revoke Moscow's ratification of a critical nuclear treaty which bans Russia from testing atomic weapons shortly after he suggested the possibility of resuming such testing: Putin could restart banned nuclear tests as Russian lawmakers review treaty A 72-year-old woman takes care of her sick husband, 75, who spent more than a year in the basement of their home in Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk region. The town has been constantly shelled since the beginning of Russia's invasion. Before the war, it had a population of around 6,000. Today only around 600-700 people still live there, without electricity or water, and constantly taking cover from shelling in basements.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

For many older and disadvantaged Australians, the proposed constitutional changes were perceived to be threatening changes. Racial and social divisions did not commence with preparations for the Voice referendum. As a royal navy navigator and later buccaneer, William Dampier (1651-1715) made three voyages to WA and offered this interpretation of our indigenous people after his second voyage in 1697 with his infamous throw-away line: The inhabitants of this country are the miserabilist people in the world. Racial divisions were embedded in Captain Cook's landfalls in Eastern Australia in 1770 and even his earlier visits to Tahiti and New Zealand. Some indigenous people were killed by the crew in a reflexive action against the local population. The Endeavour struck a reef near Cooktown in North Queensland. The Endeavour was beached for repairs. Here the Guugu Yimithirr people lead by Coomen assisted crew members who were ill or disoriented. The crew were offered food and water. However, misunderstandings did occur in the Endeavour River encounter. At least one indigenous person was killed on 17 June 1770 by a member of the Endeavour's crew and perhaps others injured in the unequal skirmish. Despite the assistance offered at Cooktown to the crew of the Endeavour, Captain Cook had orders from the British Crown to take possession of lands deemed to be terra nullius or nobody's land. The momentum of the successive 1967 referendum continued in high court decisions from Mabo v Queensland in 1992 (No1 and 2), and Wik Peoples v Queensland in 1996. Favourable rulings continued in 2002 with Yorta Nation v Victoria (2002) over land and water rights in the Goulburn and Murray River Districts which were upheld by the High Court. Throughout the campaign, the mainstream media largely endorsed this claim of the social and racial divisiveness over acceptance of the Voice proposal. The outcomes of the No campaign are now history. The Guardian (15 October 2023) has detailed results of the Voice Referendum by states, territories and even electorates. There were several electorates with Yes Votes below 20 per cent including the electorates of Maranoa (15.9 per cent) and Flynn (16.4 per cent). In juxtaposition, over thirty seats supported the Yes case with results of strong support for the Yes Case in Melbourne (78.1 per cent) and Grayndler (74.5 per cent). The results of the Voice Referendum were close to the predictions of the best opinion polls as summarized by ABC News. In support of the commitment by Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles to moving forward after a day of infamy for indigenous reconciliation, our political future needs responsible risk-taking to address long-standing divisions particularly in regional and outer suburban areas across Australia. Lack of commitment to indigenous reconciliation is embedded in blind spots about other social, economic and cultural tensions. The Brisbane River forms a divide between the more affluent electorate of Ryan and some of the more challenged precincts in the federal electorate of Blair between Moggill and Riverview. This divide was covered in two of my previous articles for AIM Network in 2017 (here and here). Community leaders have been reluctant to foster better public transport links across the social divide between the more adjacent growth areas on the fringes of Brisbane in the Springfield District and the Ripley Valley and the Ipswich CBD. Similar public transport black-spots exist between Moggill and the northside fringes of Ipswich at Karana Downs (Brisbane), Mt. Crosby, Kholo and Karalee (Ipswich). Historically, Labor leaders from the Ipswich District were adept at responding to the needs of constituents. Even prior to 1900, a Labor member from the Rosewood Coalfields was elected to state parliament. It was more difficult to gain a federal representative because the federal electorate of Moreton extended into rural areas. When federal Labor member, James Wilkinson was defeated in 1906, it took 55 years for veteran Labor leader Bill Hayden to represent Ipswich from 1961. He defeated a popular local LNP minister in the Menzies Government during an unexpected short-term recession associated with the tightening of monetary policy. Despite the controversies like Labor's opposition to the war in Vietnam, Bill Hayden's staff excelled in responding to the concerns within his electorate on mainstream local issues. His vote increased at every election until 1969. There was a close result in 1975 in Oxley after the dismissal of Gough Whitlam but there were strong swings back to Labor as early as 1977. As in other Labor heartland electorates across Australia, support for the Labor Party was insufficient to halt the No campaign with its emphasis on fears of an advisory Voice Council to express the concerns of indigenous communities to federal governments of differing persuasions. There is a significant dichotomy in the results of the Voice referendum between Ryan in Brisbane and Blair. On a divisional basis, there was a No vote of 47.3 per cent in Ryan. In Blair the No vote was 69.8 per cent. The Yes vote achieved good results even in comfortable outer-suburban polling booths in Ryan despite the mortgage stresses facing new home-owners. The Yes vote was strong in in the electorate of Ryan although some mortgage stress was possibly still evident in the results from Brookfield (47.8 per cent) and Moggill (48.3 per cent). Across the federal electoral divide Blair, the Yes vote struggled to exceed 30 per cent at many polling booths. Weak support for the Yes case brought results extended was evident in Riverview (27.6 per cent), Karalee (30.6 per cent) and Tivoli (29.6 per cent) which can be located on the map provided. As expected, the Yes vote dipped in rural and semi-rural areas with a No vote of 85.4 per cent at Tarampa and 78.7 per cent at Walloon, 77.3 per cent in Rosewood township and 80.7 per cent at Grandchester. The Australian constitution is indeed difficult to change. Change is virtually impossible without bipartisan support. The Republic Referendum on 6 November 1999 was not carried in any of the states but succeeded in the ACT with a Yes vote of 63.3 per cent in juxtaposition with a No Vote of 62.6 per cent in Queensland at that time. Only eight of the forty-five referenda options since federation have been carried. Even formation of the Commonwealth of Australia itself prior to 1900 proved to be politically divisive. The federation referendum question had to be put to the all-male NSW electorate on two occasions. WA was a late starter in the constitutional stakes. This colony of the British Empire was omitted from the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 as carried by both houses of the British parliament. Cheers to the remote indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities in electorates like Kennedy and Leichhardt in Queensland who put their faith in the Yes case despite opposition from local LNP and conservative independent members. In the post-Voice era, neoconservative representatives will find it difficult to avoid acting on local concerns about the need for diversity of employment that is compatible with acute local concerns. There are core Labor values which are compatible with a contribution to Northern Development and indigenous reconciliation through water conservation schemes, community development initiatives, infrastructure investment and sustainable programmes to diversify rural and remote economies. Even at the best of times, tourism services into exotic historical, cultural and scenic spots in the Queensland outback during the cooler months were underdeveloped. Opportunities existed for greater indigenous involvement in tourism at places like Boodjamulla (Lawn Hill) National Park. Although the Waanyi people of this national park area received their native title claim in 2010, the proprietor of Adel's Grove relied largely on interstate grey nomads to operate its accommodation and restaurant facilities for guests the last time I visited this site. More than a century ago, Albert de Lestang (1854-1959) had a much deeper commitment to the local savanna ecosystem. He experimented with the introduction of exotic and native plants at Adel's Grove and operated a store for passing tourists. Fire destroyed Albert's dwellings in the 1950s. Fire also destroyed the hub of the accommodation at Adel's Grove out quite recently. The need for greater indigenous involvement in local tourism is essential. With the support of the Queensland government, the Waanyi people negotiated an agreement with the zinc mining operations in this locality which continued until operations ceased temporarily in 2015. A history of the progressive association between mining and the Waanyi people is available online. The monograph was developed by the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining at UQ. Reaching across the political aisle at state and federal levels can assist in overcoming the disappointments of the Voice Referendum results. There are places in North West Queensland which could enthuse tourists during the winter months. The outreach of current tourism access only taps the surface of the vast array of exotic places which dot North West Queensland. Similar resources exist in the Cairns Hinterland and on Cape York from the days when mining activity moved into these remote frontiers even prior to the turn of the last century. The (locally) famous mine tram tunnel at Hightville. This tunnel was built in 1914 for the tram line that carted copper ore from the Wee Macgregor mine down the ridge to the Ballara siding, for rail transport to Townsville via Cloncurry. The Wee Macgregor mine is on the other side of the tunnel from where this photograph was taken. I would not venture through the tunnel if you are afraid of bats, there is quite a colony roosting in there. May 2007. Many potential historic relics spots are on private grazing properties and operated in the federation era (1901-14) prior to the opening of Mt. Isa Mines.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

With the situation only set to get worse, what does this mean for Europe and how can it manage the situation? Many citizens across Europe have the luxury of not worrying about how they will access water. But as the planet becomes more populated and demand for water increases - a crisis is pending. So what does this mean and how can Europe manage this precious resource? Two litres of water is enough to satisfy a person's daily drinking needs - but it takes 3,000 litres for food. Meeting this demand is set to become increasingly challenging for agriculture irrigation, which uses up 70 of freshwater worldwide. We import a lot of food and so we are reliant on how water is being managed in other parts of the world, Naho Mirumachi, Professor of Environmental Politics at King's College London told Euronews. Some 3.6 billion people around the world already have inadequate access to water, with the Middle East and Africa most impacted by water scarcity. The food that we are consuming will probably have to increasingly come from other parts of the world as we will no longer be able to produce certain products in Europe because it is getting too hot, Jippe Hoogeveen, senior land and water officer at the UN's Food and Agricultural Agency told Euronews. Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the situation. After three years of low rainfall and high temperatures, the country's national weather service declared a 'long term drought' earlier this year. Some crops may even have to be written off, the Spanish Coordinator of Famers and Ranchers Organizations has even warned. But countries in Northern and Eastern Europe are also increasingly affected by the strain on water supplies. People think that the UK is a rainy country, but actually we have been experiencing droughts as well and places like this provide important agriculture for us, stated Naho Mirumachi. Energy Scarce water resources are not only a threat to agriculture - but also to the energy sector. As we move into a net zero clean energy era, we are moving towards things like hydropower, explained Mirumachi. If we have less water in our rivers, it means that we will not have we will not be able to rely on hydropower. Hydropower plants - which use water to produce electricity or to power machines - are regarded as a sustainable energy alternative fossil-fuel driven facilities do. Population growth As the global population is set to rise to 8.5 billion by 2030, this is driving the strain on water resources. A population which is not only growing - but also consuming more. There is a growing middle class and a diversified consumer. They are going to require more material goods, not just food, but also things like phones that are actually very water intensive. And so it is not just climate change that is forcing these water shortages to occur, explained Naho Mirumachi. Mitigating the strain on water resources means ensuring a secure supply of water for humans - while respecting the environment. There is going to be a knock-on effect on the ecosystems and the health of the rivers. So if you have less water, there might be less biodiversity, which is an important aspect of keeping our environment healthy, stated Mirumachi. What is the EU doing to prevent water shortages? The World Meteorological Organization has warned that the world's water cycle is spinning out of balance, calling for a fundamental policy shift in its 2022 Global Water Resources report. Since 2000 the European Union has sought to address the issue - through the Water Framework Directive - which works to ensure the quality of Europe's waters. However, 90 of river basins in various EU countries will still be unhealthy by 2027, a report published by WWF and the Living Rivers Europe Coalition concluded. According to Nihat Zal, project manager at the European Environmental Agency, Europe's response has been effective - but needs to be accelerated at different scales, at the local level, at the country level, at the EU level, so that the level of preparedness towards the risk uncertainties will also be improved.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

CNN -- A coal train derailed off a bridge in southern Colorado on Sunday as it was crossing over Interstate 25, killing the driver of a semi truck that was passing underneath the bridge, state authorities confirmed. The train derailed around 4:30 p.m. local time near the city of Pueblo - about 45 miles south of Colorado Springs, according to a statement from the train operator, BNSF Railway. Images of the scene posted online by the Colorado State Patrol show at least ten train cars had slid off the tracks and over the side of a bridge and nearby embankment, blanketing the ground with coal. The bridge, which extends over both lanes of the interstate, appears to be partially collapsed with a semi truck crushed underneath it. The male driver of the truck was killed, state patrol spokesperson Gary Cutler told CNN. No other details on the victim were provided. There were no reported injuries among BNSF crew members, the rail company said. The derailment prompted interstate closures in both directions as authorities worked to clear the roadway, the state patrol said on social media. BNSF said its personnel are also assisting in clearing the site. The National Transportation Safety Board announced it is investigating the incident.

It also confirmed that no contract has yet been signed on a private rail deal announced a year ago. Details of the long delays emerged as Transnet's board announced on Friday that a turnaround plan for the business has been completed. The plan, which will be submitted to public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan this week, outlines a series of operational and financial initiatives to stabilise Transnet, whose rail and port failures are estimated to be costing the economy R1bn a day in lost output. But Transnet's lengthy delays in bringing in private sector partners to turn around key operations will also cement the case for the reforms outlined in a new Roadmap for the Freight Logistics System in SA, details of which were leaked to Bloomberg last week. The roadmap reportedly contains far-reaching proposals to allow private companies to access rail lines and concession ports and rail routes to private operators, and sets timelines. Though the roadmap proposes to take some of the control of the process away from Transnet, industry players are concerned it may not go far enough. Transnet announced in July that it had chosen Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) as its preferred partner to turn around the Port of Durban container terminal, which handles almost half of SA's freight. But the state-owned logistics utility told Business Day last week that it expects the contract with ICTSI to be signed only by the end of the current financial year, once the due diligence and other processes have been concluded. The NewCo will begin operating as soon as the transaction reaches financial close, which is anticipated to be in the start of the new financial year, which commences on April 1 2024, Transnet said in an emailed response to questions. The purchase price for ICTSI's stake in the new operating company has not been disclosed but it is believed to be substantial. The delay means Transnet will not receive the funds in its account in time to allay the cash crunch it faces, with more than R10bn of its bonds maturing this year. Transnet also said it has not yet concluded a contract with Traxtion Sheltam to operate the Kroonstad to East London railway line. It announced in October 2022 that it had chosen the company, which operates rail lines in several other African countries, as the preferred bidder. This was after Transnet received just two bids for the 16 rail slots it auctioned, but on terms that made them unattractive to most private operators. Transnet surprised the market in January with a call for expressions of interest to operate and maintain the crucial rail corridor transporting containers between Johannesburg and the Durban container port. Transnet said last week that work on the container corridor operating lease is ongoing. A request for proposals will be issued before the end of its financial year. The container terminal at Transnet's Ngqura port was also meant to be concessioned out to private operators, and Transnet shortlisted bidders in August 2022 -- at the same time as it shortlisted bidders for the Durban terminal. However, it said last week that no bids were received for the Ngqura terminal, as bidders could not guarantee volume growth. Transnet is reviewing options on how to get the terminal to full utilisation, it said. Industry players said Transnet required bidders to guarantee to bring certain volumes to Ngqura, in an effort to deploy its underutilised capacity to develop it as a trans-shipment port. This suggested only those international terminal operators linked to shipping lines could have bid, but evidently the terms were not attractive enough.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

On Monday the opposition leader all but abandoned his much-criticised suggestion of a second referendum, declining to recommit to the idea and warning that Australians will not want a referendum for some time. The policy will be reviewed by the Coalition senators Kerrynne Liddle and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and leading no campaigner. While the opposition seeks to maximise the political damage by blaming the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, Labor faces calls for an accelerated rollout of the remaining elements of the Uluru statement from the heart, truth telling and treaty making, and an emphasis on practical solutions to close the gap in Indigenous outcomes. The federal cabinet will meet to discuss the Albanese government's next steps to address Indigenous disadvantage, with senior government figures favouring an interim listening mechanism to provide advice directly to the prime minister. Dutton said: We said that the question put to the Australian people should have been on recognition and dropped the voice because people supported recognition but not the voice. The prime minister did not do that. The prime minister embarked on a divisive path, Dutton told reporters in Canberra. He spent 400m of taxpayers money. He was warned not to go down this path of division and he bears the responsibility for where our country is today. Asked about his policy for a second referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution, Dutton said look, all of our policy ... is going to be reviewed in the process Kerrynne and Jacinta will lead now. I think that is important, but I think it is clear that the Australian public is probably over the referendum process for some time. Dutton said that millions of Australians at the moment are hurting because the prime minister has been completely obsessed with the voice over the course of the last 16 or 17 months. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the referendum was not a vote against reconciliation, the referendum was not a vote against closing the gap. If you look at the way in which both the yes and no cases were argued, we can take from the referendum an increased resolve to act on closing the gap and to act on reconciliation, Marles told reporters in Canberra. And that is really what we need to take forward now, and in a sense of unity across the country. Although more than 60 of Australians voted no to the voice, opponents came to that position from a variety of perspectives: from shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Price's claim that there were no ongoing negative impacts from colonisation, to independent senator Lidia Thorpe's case that a no vote would advance Blak sovereignty. Those contradictions continued on Monday in a train-wreck interview by the leading no campaigner Warren Mundine, who has caused consternation among conservatives by calling for treaties with Australia's First Nations. Asked about his position on treaties, Mundine told Radio National that Indigenous Australians were in one sense recognised through land rights and through native title. Treaty has to be with the traditional owner nations and it is got nothing to do with sovereignty, he claimed, even though recognition of First Nations sovereignty is an integral part of treaties. Mundine appeared to conflate treaties with other agreements struck between groups of Indigenous people and private enterprise, whether it is governments or state and territories, in building roads, building rail ... building houses, or getting projects and mining and energy and agriculture or whatever else. Mundine said that voters did want to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the constitution as the first people of Australia but they rejected the voice. Mundine said that he would love symbolic constitutional recognition and polling suggested that 90 of Australians agreed. But the issue we got, and we all know this, is that that is the leadership of the Aboriginal community ... they do not want it and that so that is going to be a problem. Asked if constitutional recognition would happen, Mundine replied: Well, I do not know to be honest. What we got to do is do something that the government failed to do, that Albanese failed to do, and that is get everyone onboard for things to happen. The influential crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie criticised Indigenous leaders behind the Uluru statement for taking a week of silence to grieve the result. You need to come out and fight now - come out and say to the leader of this country 'what are you going to do for Indigenous communities out there?', Lambie told Sky News. But having a week's break - not on guys, you need to stand your ground now, you need to come out and say 'you have put us on a bloody life support for two years while you have been trying to sell this voice, and in the meantime you have done nothing in the Indigenous communities out there. The Greens have called for the government to establish a national truth and justice commission. Lambie labelled truth-telling a talkfest.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Put simply, it is a large place for storing things. In the UK and some other English-speaking countries, warehouses may be large retail stores, as in: We bought our dining table and chairs from a large furniture warehouse 10 miles out of town. As a verb, it means to keep something in a warehouse, to store it, as in: They only managed to sell 2,000 of the 10,000 units in January, leaving 8,000 units warehoused and unsold. Manufacturers, wholesalers, exporters, importers, customs agencies, transport companies, and many other types of businesses have or use warehouses. The physical and administrative functions related to keeping materials and products in a warehouse is known as warehousing. An automatic storage warehouse for small parts. Warehouses today are becoming increasingly automated - where robots do the work that humans used to. (Image: Wikipedia) They are generally very large plain buildings in the industrial parts of towns or cities, or out of town but close to major road, rail, air, or sea connections. Warehouses usually have a loading dock, where goods are loaded onto and unloaded from trucks. In some cases the goods are loaded directly onto train wagons, airplanes, or ships. Goods stored in warehouses include raw materials, spare parts, packing materials, components, finished products, and goods associated with manufacturing, production and agriculture. Large warehouses may have cranes for moving goods - most of them have forklift trucks. Etymology of 'warehouse' According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the noun 'warehouse' first appeared in the English language in 14th century Britain, by combining the noun 'Ware' with 'House'. It came from either Dutch Warenhuis or German warenhause. With the meaning a 'large impersonal institution', the word emerged colloquially in the United States in 1970.  Etymology is the study of the origin of words and the evolution of their meanings over time. In 1799 in Britain, people started using the verb 'To Warehouse' with the meaning 'to deposit or secure in a warehouse'. This huge, 7-storey warehouse was built in 1827 by the Aire and Calder Navigation company in Leeds, northern England. During the industrial revolution, warehouses were often great works of architecture. (Image: leodis.net) This video looks at what a career in warehousing and distribution is like.

Andrew Miller, 56 from Northamptonshire, parked his automatic Citroen DS 3 on the ground floor of Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 in the blue badge parking zone on October 8, before taking a trip to Ireland with his husband, Tim Meacock, also 56. They returned to the airport on Thursday afternoon, and Mr Miller, who has a complex spinal condition and has always been a wheelchair user, said there was no one from the airport or APCOA, its parking provider, to give him information on how to return home. Mr Miller, a broadcaster, cultural consultant and disability campaigner, said the situation has been a nightmare and accused the airport and APCOA of corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind. It comes as Luton Airport said on Sunday it was unlikely that any vehicles will be salvageable following the car fire which broke out on Tuesday, causing the site to collapse. Mr Miller said he could see his vehicle from the car park appearing to be relatively undamaged, and he was concerned the airport could be rushing to conclusions. In response to Mr Miller's situation, a spokesperson for London Luton Airport offered sincere apologies for any distress or inconvenience caused. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence, Mr Miller told the PA news agency. As a wheelchair user, I have got complex access needs and I have spent years looking for a car that I can easily get in and out of. Mr Miller said he bought his automatic Citroen DS 3 outright two weeks ago after leasing the vehicle for five years from Motability, an organisation which supports disabled drivers. The vehicle model is no longer in production, going off-sale in 2019, with Mr Miller saying: It is quite bespoke and precious to me and it really is my independence. He said the vehicle, a three-door car without a central console, is much easier for a wheelchair user to get in and out of independently, adding: It is going to be very difficult for me to find another one, not impossible, but very difficult. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence He has also fitted hand controls to the vehicle, explaining they are connected to the brake and accelerator to allow someone without the use of their legs to operate the car, adding they would cost about 500 to replace. Mr Miller said he wrote to APCOA twice, as well as posting on X, formerly Twitter, to ask Luton Airport for information on how he could return home on his arrival at the airport, but had no response. Mr Miller said when he landed at the airport he was assisted by the chaplain, who is part of the support service and available to assist those in difficulty and was exceptionally kind and patient and helped arrange a taxi for the couple to return home. In my view, it was corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind, he said. The whole thing has been a nightmare and proves to me that in a major incident situation like this, the interests of disabled people who need carefully considered bespoke solutions get tossed aside and ignored. Of Luton Airport's statement on Sunday, Mr Miller said he was concerned they (the airport) might be rushing to conclusions if cars like mine are potentially salvageable.

Two people were killed and three more injured in the Kherson area after more than 100 shells bombarded the region over the weekend, local Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on social media. Two guided bombs later hit key infrastructure in Kherson city, sparking a partial blackout and disruption to the area's water supply, reported the head of the city's military administration, Roman Mrochko. Local officials said two more people had died in the Donetsk area and that a 57-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman had been killed by an airstrike that destroyed their home in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine launched 27 drones in an overnight attack on western Russia, the Russian defense ministry announced, Sunday. Officials said that 18 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, while, they said, two more drones had been shot down over Russia's Belgorod region. They did not detail the fate of the remaining seven drones. Ukrainian media outlets later said that Kyiv's forces had carried out a successful strike on Russia's Krasnaya Yaruga electrical substation, close to the Ukrainian border. The reports could not independently verified. Fierce clashes continued across eastern Ukraine over the weekend, as Russian forces repeatedly tried to encircle the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, military officials said. Illia Yevlash, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's eastern forces, told journalists that Ukrainian forces in the area had faced 10 separate attacks in the space of 24 hours. The enemy is trying to attack us in the direction of Kupiansk to encircle it and reach the banks of the Oskol River, Yevlash told Ukrainian television. He said that Ukrainian forces in the town of Lyman in the Donetsk region had also faced heavy attack. Russian offensive Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that Russian forces are conducting an active defense and are improving their position along the entire length of the line of contact with Ukrainian forces, calling it an active defense. 'And our troops are improving their position at almost the entire area. Quite a large area, Putin said in a video posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist. Russian forces continue to attack Ukrainian positions around the town of Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region in Moscow's largest offensive in months. The General Staff of Ukraine's military said on October 15 its forces had repelled 15 Russian attacks near Avdiivka as well as in Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region. 'The adversary keeps trying to break through Ukrainian defenses, to no success,' it said on Facebook. US military aid The administration of YOU.S. President Joe Biden hopes to push through Congress a new weapons package putting together aid for Israel and Ukraine that will be significantly higher than 2 billion. In an interview on CBS's 'Face the Nation show, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the president will conduct extensive talks with Congress this week on the need for the package to be approved. Biden has been considering a budget request lumping together aid for Israel, Ukraine possibly Taiwan, and the YOU.S. southern border to improve the chances of getting it approved amid calls from some Republicans to cut money for Kyiv. Asked whether the request would be for 2 billion, as has been previously reported, Sullivan said, 'Well, the number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat.' It is not clear how any bill would move through Congress without a speaker of the House of Representatives. Republicans are struggling to pick a speaker after party hardliners ousted Kevin McCarthy nearly two weeks ago. Members must elect a new speaker before they conduct any legislative work. Rail logistics Rail logistics remain a vital component in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the British defense ministry said Sunday in its daily intelligence update, adding that Russia uses its rail system for transportation of ammunition, armor, fuel and personnel into the country. At the same time, it said, rail facilities in occupied parts of Ukraine are vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery, missiles and sabotage. The ministry said Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication. In addition, the new railway line to Mariupol that Russia is building will shorten delivery time for supplies to the Zaporizhzhia front, according to the ministry's update.

China Sea,"Last week, a Philippine Navy supply ship had a close encounter with a Chinese corvette just off the coast of Thitu Island, a Philippine-controlled natural island on the western edge of the Spratly archipelago. On Friday, the 1944-built tank landing ship BRP Benguet was under way about six nautical miles south of the base at Thitu Island, headed south for the remote Philippine station at Rizal Reef (Commodore Reef). Her mission was to resupply the garrison and provide for rotation of personnel. According to the Philippine Navy, a Chinese naval vessel with the pennant number 621 (the PLA Navy corvette Panzhihua) approached to within 80 yards. The Panzhihua then moved to cut across Benguet's bow at a distance of 350 yards. The crew of the Benguet warned off the Chinese warship with radio challenges, and a video of the scene shows that Panzhihua appeared to change course. The Panzhihua's crew responded to the radio contact by citing China's invalidated ten-dash line claim (formerly nine-dash line). China claims sovereignty over the vast majority of the South China Sea, including large swathes of neighboring states' exclusive economic zones (EEZs). The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that these claims were inconsistent with international law, but China has ignored the ruling. As a legally-recognized island, Thitu generates a 12-mile territorial sea. The location provided by the Philippine Navy suggests that the interaction occurred in sovereign Philippine waters, not just in the Philippine EEZ. These dangerous and offensive maneuvers by China's PLAN not only risk collision but also directly endanger the lives of maritime personnel from both sides. The AFP remains committed to ensuring the safety of its personnel during rotation and replenishment missions and asserts that it will continue to adhere to the rules-based international order, AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said in a statement. BRP Banguet (ex name USS Daviess County  LST-692) is a World War II tank landing ship built by Jeffersonville Boat  Machine Company in 1944. She participated in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, and later saw action in the Korean War. She has been in Philippine Navy service since 1976.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Andrew Miller, 56 from Northamptonshire, parked his automatic Citroen DS 3 on the ground floor of Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 in the blue badge parking zone on October 8, before taking a trip to Ireland with his husband, Tim Meacock, also 56. They returned to the airport on Thursday afternoon, and Mr Miller, who has a complex spinal condition and has always been a wheelchair user, said there was no one from the airport or APCOA, its parking provider, to give him information on how to return home. Mr Miller, a broadcaster, cultural consultant and disability campaigner, said the situation has been a nightmare and accused the airport and APCOA of corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind. Andrew Miller (left) said he spent 'years finding a car which would meet his 'complex access needs (Andrew MillerPA) It comes as Luton Airport said on Sunday it was unlikely that any vehicles will be salvageable following the car fire which broke out on Tuesday, causing the site to collapse. Mr Miller said he could see his vehicle from the car park appearing to be relatively undamaged, and he was concerned the airport could be rushing to conclusions. In response to Mr Miller's situation, a spokesperson for London Luton Airport offered sincere apologies for any distress or inconvenience caused. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence, Mr Miller told the PA news agency. Andrew Miller said the vehicle, a DS 3 Citroen, is 'bespoke to his access needs (Andrew MillerPA) As a wheelchair user, I have got complex access needs and I have spent years looking for a car that I can easily get in and out of. Mr Miller said he bought his automatic Citroen DS 3 outright two weeks ago after leasing the vehicle for five years from Motability, an organisation which supports disabled drivers. The vehicle model is no longer in production, going off-sale in 2019, with Mr Miller saying: It is quite bespoke and precious to me and it really is my independence. He said the vehicle, a three-door car without a central console, is much easier for a wheelchair user to get in and out of independently, adding: It is going to be very difficult for me to find another one, not impossible, but very difficult. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence Andrew Miller, Luton Airport passenger He has also fitted hand controls to the vehicle, explaining they are connected to the brake and accelerator to allow someone without the use of their legs to operate the car, adding they would cost about 500 to replace. Mr Miller said he wrote to APCOA twice, as well as posting on X, formerly Twitter, to ask Luton Airport for information on how he could return home on his arrival at the airport, but had no response. Mr Miller said when he landed at the airport he was assisted by the chaplain, who is part of the support service and available to assist those in difficulty and was exceptionally kind and patient and helped arrange a taxi for the couple to return home. In my view, it was corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind, he said. The whole thing has been a nightmare and proves to me that in a major incident situation like this, the interests of disabled people who need carefully considered bespoke solutions get tossed aside and ignored. Of Luton Airport's statement on Sunday, Mr Miller said he was concerned they (the airport) might be rushing to conclusions if cars like mine are potentially salvageable. Who knows what damage it might have sustained, I have got no idea what the vehicle looks like up close, but from a distance, it encouraged me that it was not in the collapsed part of the car park, he said.

Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in retaliation for a rampage in which its fighters stormed through Israeli towns a week ago, shooting civilians and seizing scores of hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Israel has faced heavy rocket barrages including in the south of the country, which has prompted the closure of the smaller Ashkelon port, which is the nearest terminal to Gaza. Ashdod port has imposed restrictions on the transport of hazardous materials which has meant slower transits. The port said in its latest statement posted on its website that it continued to operate as normal even under wartime, adding that it was prepared to continue to supply Israel's economy with everything that was needed around the clock to ensure the population did not experience shortages. At least three cargo and dry bulk ships carrying cargo bound for Ashdod had stopped in waters nearby, with a further three vessels including an oil tanker and a container ship heading for the port, data from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic showed on Sunday. Around 13 ships - comprising cargo, container and dry bulk vessels - were currently moored inside Ashdodport, according to MarineTraffic data. At least three laden dry bulk ships were waiting off Haifa in northern Israel, separate data showed. Haifa and Ashdod are Israel's biggest and most vital ports. The Port of Haifa, which handles multiple cargo segments including dry bulk goods, said on Sunday it was working continuously and also throughout the weekend. The activity has been reinforced to the maximum possible, within the operational and manpower limitations, in order to receive cargo of all types, including cargo that was diverted from the direction of Ashdod and unloaded at the Port of Haifa, it said in a statement. Leading container shipping line MSC said last week there were increased waiting times at Ashdod due to increased security checks and labor shortages and circumstances are subject to change at very short notice at Israeli ports. Israel's Economy Ministry said separately on Thursday there was a shortage on manpower making it harder to transport and replenish inventories due to higher consumption, although there was no shortage of supplies and urged people not to hoard food. There will be zero tolerance for price gouging, the ministry said. Wait times for ships docking in Israel have on average traditionally been much longer than in other ports. The government in recent years has been privatizing its ports and opening new ports in a bid to increase competition and efficiencies. Marine war insurance rates have surged more than ten fold since the attacks last week and some underwriters were reviewing cover provisions for Ashdod although Haifa remained unaffected, industry sources said. While Ashdod and Haifa ports account for just 0.4 of global container throughput, any expansion of hostilities beyond Israel's border could introduce risks to vital shipping chokepoints in the region, online logistics platform Container xChange said. The Suez Canal, a critical waterway for various commercial vessels, including container ships, may face disruptions, Container xChange CEO Christian Roeloffs said. Similarly, the Strait of Hormuz, a backbone for oil and gas shipping, could be affected. However, the extent of these effects will largely depend on the conflict's expansion and duration. The Marshall Islands registry, one of the world's top shipping flags, last week raised the security level for Israel's ports and its territorial waters to their highest. Threat of collateral damage to merchant vessels has increased significantly, the registry said in an advisory. Vessels with links to Israel or the United States may be under heightened threat of attack within Israeli territorial waters, the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman and Red Sea areas.

Indeed, this has been the main theme from Fed speakers despite US inflation figures suggesting a certain degree of stickiness persists in the core services sector. The grinding higher of longer-dated Treasury yields is amplifying the monetary policy tightening with Boston Fed President Susan Collins arguing this is generating some tightening of financial conditions. If it persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term. The market is currently pricing in a one-third chance of a final 25bp rate hike this year and that could decline further if we are right and the details of the retail sales and industrial production report show evidence of weakness. Headline retail sales will be lifted by higher vehicle sales and higher gasoline prices, but strip these out and it is likely to be a far weaker report. High-frequency credit card spending numbers have been soft in September and that is normally a good barometer of direction for general spending trends. The Fed's Beige Book and the minutes of the FOMC meeting also mentioned growing evidence of household savings being run down and in an environment where real household disposable income has been shrinking, the pressure on household finances is growing. Industrial production may show a modest rise in manufacturing, but the risks are skewed to the downside from auto-related strike action which has not only impacted vehicle production but also hurt suppliers. Lower oil and gas drilling could also weigh on total industrial production, as will utilities. Also watch the Fed's new updated Beige Book for anecdotal evidence of a further softening in activity. Last time, they mentioned concerns about the prospects for consumer discretionary spending while commenting that the last stage of pent-up demand for leisure travel from the pandemic era was likely over. Meanwhile, housing data will soften further with very weak pending home sales pointing to existing home sales dropping below a 4mn annualised rate, which was last seen during the global financial crisis. Mortgage rates are fast approaching 8 and this will also hurt home builder sentiment and limit the upside for housing starts. Canada: hot CPI data will make rate hike more likely Just to mention briefly that in Canada, CPI will be closely followed given the uncertainty over whether the Bank of Canada will hike again at the end of this month. A hot print could make it close to a 50-50 call. Currently, there is a one third chance priced in. Poland: minimum wage growth boosts average wages Industrial output (September): -3.8 YoY New manufacturing orders continue to shrink, albeit at a slower pace. We forecast that manufacturing output in September was substantially below levels seen a year earlier, partially as a result of the lower number of working days this year. Global trade and conditions in German industry remain unfavourable, but recent PMI readings suggest some signs of stability and chances for improvement ahead. PPI (September): -3.4 YoY Despite an upswing in global crude oil prices and the zloty weakening against the US dollar last month, wholesale gasoline and diesel prices declined markedly in September (down by around 6.5 month-on-month on average). We project prices in other key sectors of manufacturing declined as well, driving producer prices down by 0.4 MoM, and pushing headline PPI inflation down 3.4 YoY. Deflation is expected to continue in the coming months. Wages (September): 10.2 YoY Average wages and salaries in the enterprise sector are projected to have eased to 10.2 year-on-year in September from 11.9 YoY amid a higher reference base and lower number of working days, which should translate into slower growth of wages in manufacturing. Demand for labour is cooling down in some sectors of the economy but remains solid in various services. At the same time, minimum wage growth is putting upward pressure on average wages. Employment (September): 0.0 YoY Employment in the enterprise sector has stopped growing in recent months. We forecast a slight decline in the level of employment in monthly terms which should not have an impact overall. Despite poor economic conditions, there are no substantial lay-offs in the economy as labour is scarce due to supply-side factors. The working-age population is shrinking and some of the immigrants are leaving Poland. Retail sales (September): -2.0 YoY Falling inflation and strongly rising nominal wages are translating into improving real disposable income of households. As a result, we see some green shoots in retail sales and expect a turnaround in the coming months. We forecast that in September, retail sales fell by 2.0 YoY vs. -2.7 YoY in August. Consumers seem to be finally close to finding solid ground after a long period of freefall. Source: ING",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

In a statement carried by the state news agency SANA, the ministry said the airport will resume its operation on Monday after being repaired from the damage caused by the Israeli missile strike on Saturday. Meanwhile, the ministry said it would allow airlines to reschedule their flights by either using the Aleppo International Airport or the still functional Latakia airport as alternatives to the Damascus International Airport, which is still undergoing extensive repairs after being hit by an Israeli missile attack on Thursday. Both the airports in Aleppo and Damascus went out of service following the Israeli forces' attacks on Thursday. Syria's Transport Ministry announced to fix the runway of the Aleppo airport on Saturday, when its runway was again struck by Israeli forces. The repeated Israeli strikes came amid escalating tensions in the region as Israel is preparing for a massive ground operation in Gaza after a surprise attack launched by Hamas prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks. The ongoing conflict, now in its ninth day, has killed about 4,000 on both Israel and the Gaza Strip. ",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

ASHDOD, Israel -- Israel's military have called Yahya Sinwar a dead man walking, and while preparations for a ground invasion on Gaza gather pace, the hunt for Hamas' leader in the enclave also appears to be on. He chose to send the butchers into our bedrooms to kill our babies, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, told NBC News Saturday. And when they chose to go full front against Israel, they signed their own death warrant. A dead man walking. We will get to that to man. Sinwar is believed to be hiding in the labyrinth of tunnels used by Hamas militants in Gaza to conceal weapons, fighters and hostages, Israeli officials have said. But he was a wanted man long before Hamas militants launched a coordinated terrorist attack on kibbutzim, music festivals and city streets on October 7, seen by Israeli security officials as one of their most ruthless enemies. Born in a Gaza refugee camp in the early 1960s, Sinwar joined Hamas after it was founded in 1987, gaining a reputation for brutality after he reportedly helped to form the militant group's internal security force, according a profile of him by European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. Captured by Israel two years later, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in killing Israeli troops and Palestinian collaborators. But being behind bars did not stop him from rising through the ranks of the group, and it also gave him the opportunity to learn to speak Hebrew -- the language of his enemies. Sinwar was released in 2011, one of more than 1,000 Palestinian freed in exchange for one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was taken hostage by Hamas and held for five years. At the time emotions were mixed over the lopsided exchange, which allowed other violent prisoners to walk free. His prison experience may have made Sinwar particularly sensitive to the plight of Palestinian inmates and likely explains his approval of such a large-scale operation to abduct hostages, according to Michael Horowitz, geopolitical and security analyst. One of his first known attacks against Israel was the abduction of two Israelis soldiers, said Horowitz, the head of intelligence at Le Beck International, adding that Sinwar has been promising to free prisoners ever since he was elected as the head of Hamas in Gaza in a secret ballot in 2017. After taking over from former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Sinwar attempted to improve relations with Egypt and Fatah, the faction that has control of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank which is seen as more secular and moderate, according to the ECFR report. He also attempted to pressure Israel into loosening its military blockade on Gaza with a public diplomacy campaign and, at the same time, organizing and sanctioning wide-scale Palestinian protests at the Israeli border, Horowitz said. In 2018, Sinwar told The New York Times that Palestinians would prefer to earn our rights by soft and peaceful means but they were also entitled to earn them by resistance. But having seemingly made little progress with this strategy, Sinwar recently faced notable opposition in an internal Hamas election, Horowitz said. This may have pushed him to go back to full-scale confrontation, he said, adding that Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, was known as a hardliner. It was Deif who masterminded the land, sea and air attacks on Israel, which he called al-Aqsa Flood. Sinwar's diplomacy efforts cannot be discounted as an intentional disinformation campaign by Hamas, according H.A. Hellyer, a geopolitics and security specialist at the Royal United Services Institute, a London based think tank. We had the impression a number of times that Hamas was not interested in confrontation, not interested in escalation or was trying to figure out another way of doing things, he said, adding that the latest attacks showed that this had not been the overarching priority of key figures in Hamas. Even the reports that indicate that there were some warnings, nobody knew that this was what was being planned, Hellyer said. I am not even sure, frankly, if Hamas foretold or foresaw quite how much damage they would be able to wreak. And of course, not all of Hamas knew what was going on anyway. Israel's ground offensive is not just a hunt for Sinwar, but a mission to eradicate all of Hamas' governing power within Gaza, Hellyer said, adding that this would put many innocent Palestinian lives at risk. Combining that with an incredibly densely populated area, which has limited food, electricity cuts, water deprivation, fuel deprivation, it is already in the midst of humanitarian catastrophe and I think that is going to intensify in an exponential manner, he said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The issue was reported at around 10.45am and led to no trains entering or leaving the station for several hours. Avanti West Coast, London Northwestern Railway and London Overground services on the route were all affected. The train lines reopened by early afternoon, PA reports, but major disruption was still expected to continue until the end of the day.

Network Rail says it is introducing uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), which take over when the main power supply is cut, to, officials say, minimise delays to passengers. In areas that do not have UPS, engineers making the power supply more reliable by replacing ageing cables. In addition, the organisation says it has invested in fault-finding equipment so its staff can fix problems before they happen. Today's issues come after the station hit the headlines in recent weeks after the Government made changes to HS2. There had been rumours that officials were scrapping the line from Old Oak Common in West London to Euston, but the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced at the Conservative Party's annual conference last month that new trains would after all be terminating in Central London. But, he added that the management of HS2 would no longer be responsible for the Euston site, with the Government instead looking for investment from the private sector.

Throughout the area of the special military operation, as Putin officially calls the war, Russian forces were improving their position, he said on Sunday. Russian forces were in a phase of active defence, and fighting in the war zone was continuing, Putin said. The Defence Ministry in Moscow reported the shooting down of 27 Ukrainian drones, most of them in the Russian border region of Kursk. On Sunday, two people died from Russian shelling of a village in the Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian sources. The general staff in Kiev reported dozens of battles in the war zone. The southern city of Kherson was repeatedly attacked by Russian warplanes and artillery, the head of the regional military administration, Roman Morchko, reported. The enemy shelling has damaged electricity lines and destroyed houses, he wrote on Telegram. According to Mrochko, Russian airstrikes hit infrastructure in the morning. As a result, the supply of electricity and water had temporarily failed, he said. Russian forces occupied Kherson at the beginning of their invasion of Ukraine but then had to evacuate the city again in the course of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops last autumn and withdraw via the Dnipro River. From London, the British Ministry of Defence said that Russia was building a new rail link in the south of Ukraine. Moscow was relying heavily on its rail network to supply its troops, it said. Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication in Ukraine and is constructing a new railway line to Mariupol which will reduce travel times for supplies to the Zaporizhzhia front, the MoD said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Russia is using civilian contractors and equipment to complete this project, likely calculating this will complicate targeting efforts and preserve military railway troop capabilities for urgent tasks elsewhere, it continued. The MoD has been publishing updates since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while Moscow dismisses these as disinformation.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Network Rail warned passengers at Euston to expect major disruption as all trains were suspended from about 10.40am to 1pm at the earliest. At lunchtime on Sunday the concourse was packed with frustrated passengers. By 2pm the operator said the lines had reopened but cautioned passengers to check before travelling. A Network Rail spokesperson said: We are sorry for the disruption to services in and out of London Euston earlier today while our engineers repaired a fault with the signalling system in the area. Lines have now reopened but while train times return to normal we would advise passengers to check before they travel by using National Rail Enquiries. National Rail Enquiries warned on Sunday morning of cancellations and delays of up to 90-minutes. Trains continued to be delayed in the afternoon as passengers were told to try alternative routes. It was not just Euston that was affected. Passengers on a train from Coventry were told to get off at Northampton at 11.10am. One of those was Kenneth Wilson, who is partially sighted. Writing on social media, he said he was forced to make his own way to Wellingborough with no replacement bus service. Passengers on a train from Birmingham to London were also told to get off the train at Tring in Hertfordshire. Kya Banasko, an artist from Manchester, was travelling to London to watch Arsenal play Aston Villa in the Women's Super League but said she was expecting to miss the match because of the delays. In a post on X, she wrote: Got the 9:20 train from Manchester Piccadilly to watch Arsenal play at 2pm. Still on a train due to disruptions and delays and will not get to Euston til past 3:30. These services are a joke. Just after 4pm on Sunday, West Midland Railways and London Northwestern Railway (LNR) were warning passengers there could be further delays as a result of congestion due to the earlier points failure. Both LNR and Avanti West Coast (AWC) said tickets for journeys that had been disrupted would be valid on some other train services. Responding to a passenger on Sunday afternoon, AWC's X account said: I can understand your frustration, Mick. However there has been a signal failure causing trains to not be able to get inout of Euston and whilst we do have some services on the move this has caused residual delays across the network. Sharing a picture of a severely crowded train, Ken Lancashire messaged AWC to say: How can it be acceptable to pay your rail fare, that increases every year, and have to travel for 3 hours from Euston to Manchester in these cramped conditions. All because the government will not invest in the crumbling railway infrastructure.

DAILY POST recalls that the police in Borno had on Saturday arrested some personnel of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC). The Police also alleged that the arrested personnel could not identify themselves and accused them of attempting to steal train coaches. The Union, through its National President, Mr Innocent Ajiji, disclosed this while addressing journalists in Jos, the Plateau State capital, on Sunday. Ajiji, who faulted the move, maintained that the arrested persons were bonafide personnel of the corporation. He explained that the coaches were being moved to Jos for the commencement of train services by NRC in Plateau. I am in Jos to monitor the ongoing activities because the Plateau State Government has the intention of running a rail mass transit that will cover Jos, Kuru and Heipang areas. But we do not have any coach in Jos, and as a result, coaches are being conveyed from Maiduguri to be refurbished and used to run the mass transit here. The remaining coaches will be taken to another location because railway management has the intention to run inter-state mass transit. The first coach has arrived in Jos by road and this is because our tracks have been stolen, and we cannot convey the coaches by rail, he said. The president alleged that its members were arrested at the point of conveying the coaches on the directive of Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno State. He explained that the persons arrested were acting on the directive of the management of NRC, adding that it officially wrote to the Commissioner of Police in Borno State, notifying him of the need to convey its items from Maiduguri to Jos. Our members went to Maiduguri to convey three other coaches to Jos, but the police arrested them, and as we speak, they are in custody. All efforts to release them proved abortive. The police alleged that those coaches were stolen, but that is not true. The person they are alleging that he is the prime suspect is Engr Aliyu Mainasara, our Regional District Manager in the North-East. He is not a thief and so we call on the commissioner to immediately release our members, and we will be forced to down tools and stop all trains all over Nigeria from moving if this is not done, he said. Ajiji also explained that the coaches have not been put to use for the past 20 years, insisting that they were being transferred to Jos for proper utilisation. Since Boko Haram started, all our tracks were carted away by the insurgents; our bridges were all also destroyed. In fact, from Maiduguri to Bajoga, there is no single track on the ground because they have been carted away by these criminals. So, we are bringing these coaches to Jos and other places to put them to proper use, he said.

The fire spread rapidly and reached the wood warehouse located nearby. As soon as the information was received, 10-12 fire tenders reached the spot and after a lot of effort the fire was controlled, but by then the goods worth lakhs kept in both the warehouses were burnt to ashes. According to information, there is a cotton warehouse of Irfan Mansoori in front of Hela Jamaatkhana under Jiwajiganj police station area, where the fire broke out late on Saturday evening. Within no time the fire took a huge form and engulfed the nearby wooden warehouse also. The fire was so severe that the flames were visible far and wide in the darkness of the night. Due to this, chaos spread in the entire area. The people of the surrounding area tried to extinguish the fire. Meanwhile, more than a dozen firefighters reached the spot and after much effort brought the fire under control. CSP Sumit Agrawal said that more than a dozen fire brigades reached the spot and barely controlled the fire. If the fire was not extinguished in time, it would have reached the scrap warehouse and nearby houses. The reason for the fire is not clear at present. The damage caused by the fire has not even been assessed. He said that the cotton warehouse belongs to Irfan Mansoori, the wooden warehouse belongs to Afzal Qureshi and the scrap warehouse belongs to Afzal's son Sohail Qureshi.

Please try again later verifyErrors  Following the severe fire in a car park at Luton airport, all 1,405 vehicles currently in the facility are likely to be destroyed when the structure is demolished. The news emerged five days after the blaze at the airport's Car Park 2. The fire led to the closure of the airport for 18 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, 10-11 October; 235 flights were cancelled, affecting up to 40,000 passengers. A spokesperson for Luton airport said: Regrettably, it is unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable. However, this is still in the process of being assessed. We are working with the Association of British Insurers on behalf of the many insurance companies to establish whether it will be possible to safely retrieve any personal possessions and, if so, how this process may work. Details of the vehicles have been provided to the Motor Insurers' Bureau which in turn has handed them on to individual insurance firms. On the day after the fire, a senior fire officer told The Independent that the extreme temperatures during the blaze will have weakened the multi-storey car park so much that attempting to recover vehicles could be deemed too dangerous. The site has now been handed back to the airport, following police and fire investigation. Work to assess the structural integrity of the car park is underway, with stabilisation work scheduled to begin on Monday. When the task is complete - which is likely to take several days - the prospects for salvaging any vehicles and possessions will be reassessed. The Luton airport spokesperson added: We recognise this has been an extremely distressing time for all concerned. We would like to thank our customers for their ongoing patience and understanding while we work through the many complexities following this incident. Since Tuesday evening, together with Apcoa parking, we have responded to almost 16,500 customer queries. Dealing with such a large volume of inquiries, while an investigation is ongoing, has naturally extended our response times.

A statement by the Nigerian Railway Corporation MD, Fidet Okhiria on Sunday, stated that the viral video purported to have emanated from NTA had alleged that police had intercepted some criminals trying to steal a train coach at the Maiduguri Railway Station. Okhiria, who spoke from China, said the coach in question was actually heading to Jos for repair ahead of its deployment on the rail corridor to enhance the Mass Transit Train Shuttle (MTTS), which is meant to help alleviate the impact of the fuel subsidy removal on the masses. He said the RDM Maiduguri in a photograph was seen successfully handing over the coaches to his Jos counterpart when the coach got to its destination last week.

You may wish to note that the recent removal of subsidy on premium motor spirit (PMS) impacted the cost of transportation among others. The NRC is of the view that making more rail routes available will greatly subsidize the cost of transportation and thereby reducing the hardship experienced by commuters. This informed the need for the overhaul of some of our non-functional rolling stock. However, the expertise required for the overhaul of the rolling stock, the statement stated, is not available in Maiduguri, hence the need for the movement of 9SPA coaches, 1DRC and 1BVA from Maiduguri to Jos.

Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has now received a report about the blaze on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park on Tuesday. Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said up to 1,500 vehicles were inside the car park at the time of the fire. In a statement, the airport said it is 'unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable' but this was 'still in the process of being assessed'. One hundred firefighters spent 12 hours battling the inferno at the airport's Terminal Car Park Two when the 20million block was engulfed by flames and caved in just before 9pm this week. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has received a report about the blaze on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park on Tuesday This week's fire rapidly engulfed the parking structure, which had 1,500 cars in at the time The fire caused part of the car park to completely collapse and left the structure unsafe to enter The airport said it had provided the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) with the registration details of 1,405 vehicles and, along with its parking provider APCOA, it had responded to almost 16,500 customer queries since the fire. The car park remains closed after the blaze caused it to partially collapse, and it was revealed on Saturday that no-one can access the structure safely, making it impossible to properly assess the damage done. It has been extensively damaged by the fire, with debris of cars piled up within the blackened structure. The airport's Dart rail transit system, which opened earlier this year, remains closed. Investigators believe the blaze was started when a diesel car, thought to be a Range Rover, suffered an electrical fault or leaking fuel line. In a statement, London Luton Airport apologised to customers with vehicles in the car park, which is a five-minute walk from the airport's terminal. It said: 'We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car parking customers, and that many are still anxious for more detail.

The airport said the emergency services have handed back control of the site and it is working to make it safe. It is likely that Terminal Car Park 2, which was built in 2019 at a cost of 20million, will now have to be demolished. Experts believe that if it had been fitted with an effective sprinkler system, the fire could have been stopped from spreading, leading only to localised damage. A government source confirmed to MailOnline that they are 'undertaking a major review of the fire safety guidance to the building regulations, including research on the fire resistance of car parks'.

I have been conditioned to act and behave in a very specific way, said Avant. I try to do my hair. I make sure I shower, have nice clothes. Sometimes I put on my University of Michigan shirt. It is a strategy to combat discrimination the 42-year-old photographer of Mesquite, Texas, has developed over a lifetime of managing her sickle cell disease, a rare blood disorder that affects an estimated 100,000 Americans. The hereditary condition can affect a person of any race or ethnicity, but Black patients, like Avant, make up the majority of those afflicted in the YOU.S. For people living with the disease, a sickle cell crisis can happen at any time. When it does, their rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells become stuck in their blood vessels, blocking flow and causing extreme pain or breathing difficulties. A crisis can escalate into life-threatening complications such as strokes, seizures, and sepsis. When a pain crisis cannot be managed at home, patients head to the ER to access the high dosage of opioids they need, in addition to IVs to help with dehydration or even blood transfusions. Yet staffers in emergency departments -- already overextended and grappling with nursing shortages -- do not always have experience in treating the rare disease. Doctors, amid a still-raging opioid crisis, remain resistant to prescribing the painkillers necessary to treat sickle cell crises. So, patients say, they face long delays before receiving essential care, plus discrimination and suspicion that they are seeking drugs to get high. I have to look like I am not coming in here off the street looking for medication, said Avant. I have to put on an entire show to get you to believe that I need care. Years of research have documented the delays. A study published in 2013 found that patients seeking care from 2003 through 2008 at an ER for their sickle cell crises experienced 50 longer wait times than patients who arrived at ERs with broken legs or arms. A study published in 2021 found that 50 of sickle cell patients reported having to wait at least two hours before their pain was treated, despite medical guidelines recommending such patients in crisis receive their first dose of pain medication no more than 60 minutes after arriving at the ER. Medical associations such as the American Society of Hematology, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Emergency Nurses Association have established guidelines for emergency department-based care of sickle cell pain. And, in 2021, the Emergency Department Sickle Cell Care Coalition, a national collaboration of hematologists, pharmacists, and nurses, helped launch a point-of-care tool to help medical professionals manage the disease in the ER. But patients and sickle cell experts said those best practices have not been widely adopted. A 2020 survey of nearly 250 emergency medicine providers found that 75 of them were unaware of the NHLBI's recommendations, first published in 2014, yet 98 felt confident in their ability to treat patients with sickle cell disease. Still, ER horror stories abound among adults with sickle cell disease. For Lesly Chavez, 29, a Houston hairstylist, her worst experience occurred a few years ago. She said she spent four hours in a waiting room before getting seen. And when they finally got to me, they told me they could help with 'my addiction,' but they decided that there was nothing that they could do for me, Chavez said. They just flat-out said 'no' and sent me home while I was in crisis. Chavez said she has since avoided that hospital even though it is 10 minutes from her home. Now she drives to a different ER, 30 minutes away. Chavez, who is Hispanic, said that she confronts doubt everywhere I go because sickle cell disease primarily affects Black Americans. (Those who are Hispanic can be of any race.) Paula Tanabe, a professor of nursing at Duke University, who has spent decades researching ways to improve care for sickle cell patients, said a confluence of factors adds to the racial bias patients may face. Emergency rooms are incredibly overcrowded, at rates that we have never seen before, and that is for everyone, said Tanabe. Legislators are trying to help. One federal bill introduced in June would allocate 8.2 million annually for five years to a program that trains doctors on best practices for caring for sickle cell patients. Another, introduced this spring, would provide funding for community organizations working to spread awareness about the condition and give student loan relief to medical providers who commit to working on the disease. Some state legislatures have established sickle cell task forces to improve physician education and care coordination. Advocates for sickle cell patients said investment in data collection to track the disease is also important. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some 100,000 Americans have it, the true number is unknown. That is because no national system exists to collect data on sickle cell, unlike other conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's. I am 32 and we have been saying it is 100,000 my entire life, said Quannecia McCruse, who co-founded the Sickle Cell Association of Houston. I know there is more. I know people are going uncounted. Eleven state-led data collection programs currently exist and, in February, the CDC opened a new grant application for additional states. Improved data would allow funding to be allocated toward the areas with the greatest need, sickle cell patient advocates said. Texas had an opportunity to join those efforts. This spring, the state legislature passed a bill with broad bipartisan support to create a sickle cell patient registry, but Republican Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed it, saying it would compromise patient privacy. That was a bad excuse, said McCruse. We have a cancer registry already, and everyone is information is safe. That registry would have gone a long way to help. While progress grinds slowly, patients like McCruse say they are forced to balance advocating for themselves during bouts of excruciating pain against the need not to irritate or alienate hospital staffers. It feels like someone is taking a Taser and shocking the crap out of me. Or when it is really bad, and it feels like shards of glass are just moving through my veins, said the mother of two. It is very, very painful. And you are telling somebody whose body is torturing them that it is not that bad? Alexis Thompson, a hematologist who treats sickle cell patients at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said she works with her pediatric patients to develop self-advocacy skills. But sometimes that backfires. The great irony is patients who are well informed and capable of self-advocating are being accused of being manipulative, because they are capable of articulating very clearly what is effective for them down to the name of the medication or the absolute dose, Thompson said. Sickle cell experts recommend that doctors adhere to a patient's individual pain plan, if available. Thompson said those plans, which document patients' diagnoses alongside a recommended medication and dosage, can be uploaded to online portals that patients can pull up on their cellphones when visiting an ER to verify what they need. Patients such as Avant hope such steps can help decrease their ER waits while easing their anxiety about seeking emergency care. I do not fear dying, said Avant, but I do fear dying in the hospital.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The protesters carried placards asking the NRC not to move the coaches out of Maiduguri. One of the protesters, Malam Adamu Ibrahim, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that they suspected that the government was trying to deny Borno of having a train service. At the peak of insurgency, the NRC came and took two of the coaches; now they are trying to take everything away. This is unacceptable,'' he said. Another protester, Malam Babakura Goni, said the removal of the coaches would deny Borno of critical infrastructure. Goni noted that the intention of the NRC or the government was not properly understood, noting that there should be transparency in the exercise. Yet another protester, Malam Babagana Chiroma, said: This is an economic sabotage of our state. They want to go and renovate the coaches and put them into use in another state.'' Chroma urged the Borno government to intervene against the action of the NRC. Addressing the protesters, Borno's deputy governor, Malam Usman Kadafur, sued for patience, assuring that the government was already addressing the issue. He noted that the protesters were expressing their displeasure over the action of the NRC because there was insufficient sensitisation on its part. The deputy governor enjoined the Federal Government to look into the possibility of rehabilitating the coaches in Maiduguri and not to take them outside Borno. Kadafur assured the protesters that the government would not allow the action to be undertaken without transparency. The Federal Government should look into the possibility of reviving the rail system to revamp our socio-economic activities. This rail terminus in Maiduguri has a history of enhancing trans-Sahara activities with neighbouring countries of Niger, Chad and Cameroon. This administration will not allow such action. We are representatives of the Federal Government in Borno. If the NRC wanted to engage in such activity, it ought to have informed the state government or even sensitise our people about the move. This government will engage with the Federal Government to ensure that things are done in the proper way and transparently,'' Kadafur further assured.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed Trump's warnings that Huawei posed a grave security risk to the West -- and defied his threat that the YOU.S. would curb intelligence sharing with allies who let the Chinese company build their future mobile networks. Germany will not exclude a company simply because it is from a certain country, Merkel declared at global policy conference in Berlin in March 2019. What followed was a burst of lucrative contracts between the Chinese tech giant and German telecommunications firms: Huawei is in the midst of constructing 5G infrastructure throughout the country, connecting Germany with Europe and the YOU.S. Now, however, is a season of worry and regret on both sides of the Atlantic. The Biden administration told POLITICO and WELT, a German national daily newspaper, it is as resolute as its predecessor in its belief that the infrastructure being built by Huawei in Germany renders a key NATO ally vulnerable to cyberattacks and data theft. But it is largely pressing its case against Huawei behind closed doors, in the belief that Trump's brash diplomacy backfired in Berlin. Meanwhile, the Berlin establishment is not dismissing YOU.S. warnings about Huawei -- or China -- anymore. Shocked when Russia's invasion of Ukraine cost the country its natural-gas lifeline, Germans are suddenly alert to the risks that emerge when business partners become geopolitical enemies. Unlike five years ago, they increasingly warn that there is no technical solution to the risks posed by heavy reliance on the Chinese firm. Two senior German intelligence officials, granted anonymity to discuss confidential matters, told POLITICO and WELT that they now believe that Huawei's dominance of Germany's fourth- and fifth-generation radio access networks represents a major threat to their country's security. To believe that the installation of Huawei technology is unproblematic is infinite naivety, one senior German intelligence official said in an interview. The official did not specify the risks Germany's heavy reliance on Huawei gear poses. But YOU.S. officials have long warned that the firm's telecommunications equipment provides a springboard for Beijing to siphon off confidential data or sabotage the critical services that increasingly rely on civilian mobile networks, like self-driving cars, autonomous machinery or -- for a NATO ally like Germany -- sensitive military and diplomatic communications. Those who dismiss the risks of using Huawei gear lack the imagination of what is possible in the field of cyber espionage, the official said. Those warnings have intensified in severity and broadened in scope since 2019, an investigation by POLITICO and WELT has found. But there is serious concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Huawei -- which has a multibillion-euro business in Germany -- is already so embedded in German telecommunications networks that the government will resist taking strong action against it. Current and former officials tell a story of how growing mistrust within the transatlantic alliance strengthened Germany's resistance to taking direction from Washington, while the country's political class followed its longstanding instinct that business dealings can be separated from geopolitical concerns. The officials point to dysfunctional relationships among the leaders of the alliance: Merkel's distaste for Trump -- which was shared by many leaders across the German political landscape -- seemed to blind her to the fact that his warnings about Huawei should be taken seriously. And Trump's own desire for the spotlight and his failure to cultivate the kind of confidential relationships that have helped to maintain the YOU.S.-European alliance for decades set the stage for conflict rather than cooperation. For its part, Huawei -- whose European headquarters is in Germany -- vigorously denies the notion that its gear is uniquely vulnerable to subversion, and that it is beholden to Beijing. Huawei has been operating in Germany for over 20 years and is a reliable supplier of innovative technologies with a very good cybersecurity record. Huawei is one of the most open, most evaluated and transparent technology companies in the world, Patrick Berger, head of media affairs for Huawei, said in an email. But many German lawmakers and government officials now regularly bemoan the close commercial ties between Huawei and the country's three major mobile operators: Deutsche Telekom, Telefnica, and Vodafone. Our own security interests were ignored for far too long, Norbert Rttgen, a conservative lawmaker in the German parliament, known as Bundestag, said in an interview. We would have saved time and money if the security policy dimension of Huawei had been the focus from the beginning. In March, Germany's Interior Ministry launched a probe of gear made by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese equipment maker, in the country's telecommunications networks, and signaled the review could lead to tighter restrictions on the two companies. A leaked draft plan now circulating among the German government would require the country's mobile operators to significantly cut back their reliance on Huawei gear and ban it completely from sensitive parts of the network. But some are calling for more drastic action. I advocate for a complete abandonment of Huawei technology in the entire German mobile network, Maximilian Funke-Kaiser, member of parliament for the FDP, which is part of the coalition government of Merkel's successor, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said in an interview. The Biden administration, too, is hoping to see the country significantly curb its reliance on Huawei gear, or phase it out altogether. Senior administration officials maintain that it has consistently pressured Scholz's government to take strong action -- but quietly, behind the scenes. Pounding your fists on the table and saying, 'My way or the highway,' is not always the most effective diplomatic strategy, a senior official in the YOU.S. State Department, granted anonymity to discuss a matter of national security, told POLITICO. But make no mistake, the pressure, if anything, has ramped up. Still, Germany's ties to both Huawei and China are substantial, and multiple current and former officials interviewed by POLITICO and WELT expressed skepticism of the country's willingness to take decisive action in defiance of their own tech and telecom companies, or of Biden's willingness to press the issue. China has been Germany's largest trade partner for seven years running, with bilateral trade volumes reaching almost 334 billion in 2022. Last December, a blistering EU-wide study estimated that German mobile operators had sourced 59 percent of the gear in their 5G radio access networks and 57 percent in their 4G networks from Huawei and ZTE. Those dependencies have led the country's mobile providers to warn that removing Huawei equipment nationwide would hamper German economic growth, costing roughly four-to-five billion euros. There is also a fear that strong action on Huawei could invite blowback from China -- and not without good reason. In December 2019, China's then-German ambassador, Wu Ken, threatened consequences if Berlin excluded Huawei from the German market. And in response to a request for comment on this story, a spokesperson for China's German embassy largely reiterated those warnings. If Germany unjustly excludes Chinese companies ... without providing evidence that Chinese products pose a security threat to Germany, we will not stand idly by, the spokesperson wrote in a statement. Germany is in a bad position to take an economic hit, as many analysts believe it is in the second year of a recession. Most of YOU.S.'s closest allies have banned or restricted Huawei. That includes all five members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership -- the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, along with the YOU.S. -- and Japan, Taiwan and France. The European Commission is also urging more EU countries to curb the firm's access to their markets, with 10 EU countries having done so already. Matthew Turpin, a former director for China on Trump's National Security Council, conceded that Trump's confrontational approach to Germany was self-defeating. But like other current and former officials in Berlin and Washington interviewed for this story, he expressed doubts that Germany may be truly on the cusp of making a big change, or that the YOU.S. has enough leverage to get what it wanted. It was clear to me always that the Germans were actually not afraid we would cut off intelligence to them, said Turpin, now a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. But when the Chinese ambassador in Berlin says, 'You know, it would be a shame if something happened to the German automobile companies,' they do believe that threat, he said. Lindsay Gorman, a former senior adviser on technology issues for the Biden administration's National Security Council, agreed that Trump's approach to Germany backfired. But Gorman, who is now head of technology and geopolitics at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, questioned whether Biden's behind-the-scenes lobbying would be enough to overcome dogged pushback from German industry. The stakes could not be higher when it comes to Germany because ... we are not just talking about one layer of digital infrastructure, we are talking about a full technology stack that gets built on top of it, she said, pointing to Huawei's investments in biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and surveillance technology. If China has an advantage in the infrastructure layer, that confers an advantage in all the other application layers that are built on top of it, Gorman continued. And that is why this decision is so critical. The Trump administration launched its pressure campaign against Huawei in 2018 due to three overlapping concerns. The first was that Beijing could siphon off or sabotage any data passing through Huawei's networks, since it wielded legal authority over the company. Second, mobile operators across the globe were on the verge of upgrading their networks to 5G. The transition would radically expand the amount of information and variety of services -- from smart grids to smart cars -- that would depend on the antennas and base stations companies like Huawei manufactured. Finally, backed by dirt-cheap prices and increasingly competitive manufacturing, Huawei was gobbling up contracts to build those networks across the globe -- thus extending the risks of data theft and cyber-physical disruption deeper into the capitals of key YOU.S. allies, like Berlin. YOU.S. and EU officials assert Huawei could only offer those bargain deals due to China's aggressive state subsidies -- a claim the firm denies. Still, as Huawei edged out Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson for highly specialized equipment contracts everywhere from London to Amsterdam to Norway, YOU.S. officials started to worry that Europe's two leading telco giants would fall hopelessly behind, eventually leaving the continent with nowhere to turn but Huawei. Having a Chinese company that is strongly susceptible to the Communist Party of China leading the globe in a foundational technology was not only a security problem, but a major economic problem, Josh Cartin, a former NSC staffer during the Trump administration, said in an interview. Because the YOU.S. boasted no direct competitors to Huawei, the Trump administration leaned into the idea that its pressure campaign would benefit two European firms, Nokia and Ericsson. To its surprise, that pitch fell flat in Berlin, the heart of the European solidarity project. The Germans did not even seem to bat an eyelash at the Ericsson and Nokia argument, said Josh Steinman, the former senior director for cyber policy on Trump's national security council. Germans felt their telecommunications network was an embarrassment, Steinman said, and that Huawei's bargain deals offered the quickest route to fixing that. Economically speaking, they may have had a point. By 2018, Huawei already had a large footprint in Germany's older telecommunications networks. Barring it from the nation's 5G -- as the YOU.S. wanted -- meant mobile operators would slowly have to phase out older Huawei equipment, too. Legacy gear from one equipment maker often is not compatible with newer equipment from another. A Huawei-commissioned study from Oxford University in December 2019 estimated that excluding the firm from Germany's 5G rollout would cost Berlin 7 billion dollars over fifteen years. A separate study by GSMA, a mobile industry trade group that includes Huawei, projected that a Huawei 5G ban would cost European operators 62 billion. Those figures were significantly inflated to scare off a ban, YOU.S. officials and some telecommunications industry experts believe. But they were not completely without merit. And either way, they had currency in Germany, where one of the country's largest mobile operators, Deutsche Telekom, is partially state-owned. Germany had a huge install base of 2G, 3G and 4G Huawei in their networks, said Sue Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump. And so what we were asking them to do is basically rip and replace. And that is a big deal. If Trump was asking a lot of the Germans, he did the same elsewhere across Europe. And in Prague, Paris, and -- after significant hesitation -- London, YOU.S. allies agreed the risks stemming from Huawei gear could only be addressed through targeted restrictions against it. Often, the costs of boxing the firm out of 5G networks were not nearly as bad as the firm had warned. A key difference in Germany was that Berlin did not see the YOU.S. as an honest broker when it came to spying. Trump's warnings about Huawei really did not work with the Germans because they were like, 'No, hang on. We are not so sure about this. What about all your spying?' said Janka Oertel, the director of the Asia programme and a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. In 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden showed that the National Security Agency had tapped Merkel's phone, a revelation that still rankled in Berlin. In the fall of 2019, Merkel announced that the country would not bar Huawei from participating in its 5G rollout. Berlin instead adopted stricter, vendor-agnostic security criteria for equipment suppliers -- a compromise that YOU.S. officials argued was inadequate. The Germans defended their approach, in part, by arguing that the YOU.S. had no evidence Huawei did anything wrong. For such serious decisions like a ban, you need proof, Arne Schnbohm, Germany's then-top cybersecurity official, told news weekly Spiegel in December of 2018. For Americans, that argument missed the point. Everyone got hung up on the notion of a smoking gun, said Gordon. YOU.S. officials saw Huawei as more akin to a loaded gun, the type of weapon Beijing would only exploit in a crisis. To support that argument, Gordon and other former officials said, they often pointed to a 2017 law that requires Chinese tech companies to support the Communist Party's intelligence gathering efforts. Huawei denies that that law -- China's 2017 National Intelligence Law -- mandates that it assist the country's intelligence services. Huawei has obtained various legal opinions on the subject, all of which agree that it is not subject to any legal provisions that could bring it into conflict with German laws, Berger, the Huawei spokesperson, said in an email. Lacking the proof YOU.S. officials insisted would not come until it was too late, the Germans were reluctant to come down hard on Huawei. YOU.S. officials believed Berlin's enormous economic dependency on China was a key obstacle. By 2020, German automakers Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW were selling more cars in China than anywhere else in the world. That made Berlin especially sensitive to fears of Chinese retaliation. German policy towards China has always been primarily industrial policy, said Rttgen, the conservative lawmaker. During the Trump years, Germany did not want to antagonize China and thus provoke disadvantages for the German automotive industry, which China openly threatened. Gordon agrees. Part of their unstated concern, we always believed, was the economic damage that would be imposed by China as a retribution for walking away from Huawei, she said. For Turpin, the former NSC official, Germany's apprehensions of Chinese bullying were proof of the very point the YOU.S. was trying to make. Whether it was blunt economic pressure or technically sophisticated cyberattacks, relying heavily on Huawei meant making yourself vulnerable to Chinese coercion. For the Germans to continue to tell us, well, we need a smoking gun, we have not seen intelligence, suggests that they are being just completely obtuse, he said. Turpin and other Trump administration officials believe it was difficult to convey that message, in part, due to the Germans' bitter dislike for Trump and his high-pressure style of diplomacy. Since he entered office, Trump had berated Germany and other NATO allies as free riders because they failed to fulfill the alliance target of spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense. He also frequently threatened to levy a 20 percent tariff on European car imports -- a potentially crippling blow to Germany's auto industry, and a threat that looked an awful lot like the one YOU.S. officials were suggesting could come from China. Merkel is looking at this through the lens of, first of all, I am not going to side with Donald Trump. And second of all, I am not going to jeopardize our economic relationship with Beijing, he said. It was that type of behavior from the YOU.S. president that turned Germans into some of the world's foremost Trump critics by the end of 2019. A survey published that December by British research firm YouGov found that roughly two-fifths of Germans believed Trump was the world's most dangerous world leader, even ranking above North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Still, the Trump administration was not shy about browbeating the Germans on Huawei. In March 2019, Trump's then-ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, wrote a letter to the German Minister of Economic Affairs threatening to curb intelligence sharing with Berlin unless it excluded Huawei from the pending rollout of its 5G networks. In it, Grenell warned that the 2017 law meant Beijing could force Huawei and ZTE to share confidential information that passed through their German networks, potentially compromising sensitive defense and intelligence data belonging to NATO. The letter, which leaked to reporters, was followed by repeated public warnings from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, when the two were in Germany. Those early efforts failed because we were going around the world, banging on the table like the ugly American, and saying, 'Do not buy Huawei,' said Keith Krach, who began as Trump's under secretary of state for economic affairs in June 2019. Like Turpin, Krach believes the bluntness of the Trump team's early appeals backfired. After he came into his role, he tried to develop a positive vision of how German industry could benefit by reducing its reliance on Huawei, he said. But Steinman, Trump's senior director for cyber policy on his national security council, pushed back against the idea that the administration's vocal approach was foolhardy. When one of your major trading partners, when one of your major military allies, is doing things that are contrary to their national interest -- and as an ally, things that are contrary to yours, too -- you say something, he said. I would not call that brash, I would call that honest. Whatever the reason, Turpin said he realized how difficult it would be to move the Germans off Huawei during a trip to Berlin in May 2019. After a day of meetings with his German counterparts, Turpin's hosts brought him to a rooftop bar overlooking the city's Kaiser-Wilhelm Memorial Church. The church, which had been leveled during a World War II bombing raid, later became a symbol of Germany's commitment to avoiding the sins of its Nazi past. But the view that day featured a perverse twist: The church's new tower had been covered in an enormous, 360-degree advertisement for Huawei. The idea that a solemn monument that is supposed to look at the full crimes and challenges of the Second World War had turned into an advertisement for Huawei, it was like, 'Guys, this is what we mean,' Turpin said. The ground beneath Huawei began to shift in Germany in February 2022, virtually the same day Russian tanks rolled across the border of Ukraine. Moscow's unprovoked invasion brought war practically to Germany's doorstep. China's refusal to condemn it did not sit well in Berlin. The Ukraine invasion has prompted this realization in Germany that depending on autocrats for critical infrastructure is just not sustainable, said Gorman, the former member of Biden's national security council. China's response to the invasion has greatly clarified the Huawei issue across Europe, added the senior State Department official. It is not lost on people that in Europe's hour of need, China declared a 'no limits friendship' with Putin. China's tacit support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed Germany to pare back its enormous economic dependence on China. In July, the German government released its first-ever China strategy, a 61-page document that labeled China a systemic rival -- one of the first official acknowledgements that Beijing was not just an engine of GDP growth for Berlin. On Huawei specifically, the war also hardened the German intelligence community's assessment of its ability to manage the risks of the firm's telecommunications gear. Merkel and the former German cybersecurity chief, Schnbohm, had previously argued that mobile operators could mitigate the risks of using Huawei gear through rigorous testing and security monitoring, especially of equipment used in the most critical part of the network, known as the core. The country's three major mobile operators moved to limit how heavily they used Huawei gear for their core, while turning unreservedly to the firm to build out the antennas and base stations that constitute the mobile radio access networks, or (RAN). In older telecommunications networks, RAN was regarded as less sensitive because it relayed -- but did not process or store -- data. But the arrival of 5G meant the edge of a network was beginning to feature the same computing capabilities as its nerve-center-like core, eroding the security distinction between the two. YOU.S. officials made this point forcefully during the Trump administration and German intelligence officials are increasingly agreeing today. In separate interviews for this story, the two senior German intelligence officials likened the country's continued reliance on Huawei RAN to its disastrous investment in the Russian natural gas pipeline, Nord Stream II. Berlin once saw the 11 billion pipeline as a central pillar of its energy future. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced Germany to cancel the contract, validating repeated YOU.S. warnings that Berlin should not place its economic fortunes in the hands of autocratic governments, like the Kremlin. Germany's digital dependency on Huawei could have even more serious consequences than Nord Stream II because it could provide a springboard for Beijing to sabotage German infrastructure, not just coerce the country economically, the second intelligence official said. Even as Berlin has soured on China, some within Germany still view the warnings about Huawei with intense skepticism. German security authorities have presented alleged evidence of vulnerabilities in Huawei gear to German parliamentarians only one time, during a classified session of the Bundestag's Digital Committee in April, two individuals familiar with the meeting told POLITICO and WELT. At the meeting, security officials warned lawmakers about a vulnerability in a Huawei component in the antenna network responsible for energy management -- the same issue that sparked the German Interior Ministry's probe into gear made by Huawei and ZTE. But two participants at the meeting, granted anonymity due to the classified nature of the session, said the security officials did not confirm whether the vulnerability has ever been exploited or if it was designed to cause significant disruptions. The warnings were purely theoretical, leaving them unsure about the severity of the threat, they said. One German telecommunications industry insider, granted anonymity to speak openly on the matter, called the allegations ridiculous. Huawei also strongly disputes the potential for remote sabotage of its gear. We are not aware of any technically plausible description of how espionage and sabotage would be possible for an equipment supplier via the radio access network, Huawei's Berger said in an email. The equipment supplier has no remote access to the equipment and the data is highly encrypted according to 3GPP standards. Those doubts are one reason Germany's tougher talk on Huawei has not yet been backed up by action. In 2021, under Merkel's leadership, the German parliament passed a new IT security law that for the first time gave the government the power to bar equipment made by untrustworthy telecommunications providers from parts of Germany's mobile network. But the German government has bypassed every opportunity to invoke the law against Huawei or ZTE since then. It has declined three separate opportunities to block new critical components from the Chinese firms from being introduced into critical parts of Germany's mobile network, as documents disclosed in a September parliamentary inquiry revealed. And despite the vocal warnings from YOU.S. and, later, German officials about the reliability of Huawei gear, German industry has signed contract after contract with the firm since Merkel's decision not to ban Huawei from the country's 5G networks. In 2019, Duisburg, a German city, announced plans to collaborate with Huawei for a large-scale smart city project. That same year, Germany's largest mobile operator, Deutsche Telekom, inked a partnership with Huawei that even included special provisions for potential supply chain disruptions resulting from YOU.S. trade restrictions. And as recently as March, Deutsche Bahn, the partially state-owned rail operator, signed a 67 million deal for its digitization. With each new installation, it becomes more difficult to remove these Chinese components from our mobile network, Reinhard Brandl, a member of the opposition CSU party, said in an interview. German mobile operators and others with big investments in Huawei have argued publicly that any policy to rip and replace Huawei gear -- or even phase it out too rapidly -- would be enormously costly. In September, after the leak of a draft plan to require German mobile operators to remove all critical components from Chinese vendors in their 5G core networks and reduce the share of Huawei RAN below 25 percent by 2026, German mobile operators reacted with alarm. Telefonica publicly warned it could seek damages and legal action if the plan went into effect. Stephan Broszio, a spokesperson for Deutsche Telekom, called the interior ministry's timeline for replacing Huawei gear completely unrealistic. In general, we do not understand why German mobile customers, who benefit from one of the best 5G networks in Europe, should be unnecessarily subjected to significant quality losses, Broszio wrote in an email. Barclays has estimated a requirement to replace all Huawei RAN would cost all three major mobile operators 2.6 billion. The German national railway company Deutsche Bahn, whose deal with Huawei covers a different mobile communications technology than 5G, has said a blanket ban on its gear would cost it 420 million. Oertel, the European Council on Foreign Relations expert, argued that Germany's mobile operators knew that by investing so heavily and so quickly in Huawei for their 5G rollout, they would make a ban more difficult. But she said she holds the government accountable as well. The government thought that by signaling we are potentially banning Huawei, maybe then operators will come to their senses and will not build this in anymore, she said. That did not work. It fell short as a strategy. Gorman, the Biden administration official, said that Huawei's economic foothold made Germany a sticky widget on Huawei. But she argued that it is critical Berlin start reducing its reliance on the firm's equipment as soon as possible. Unfortunately, these networks take so long to change, it is almost harder to turn them off than to reverse course on something like Nord Stream II, she said. And that is why the planning needs to happen now, before we get into a crisis scenario. The State Department official sounded a similar sense of urgency. In a 30-nation alliance that is really predicated on having some degree of information and intelligence symmetry, we simply cannot afford for there to be a soft underbelly to the alliance from an information and intelligence sharing standpoint, the official said. Unfortunately, in places like Germany, the official wrote later in an email, warnings from government security services have not decisively moved the needle for industry. Current and former Biden administration officials say that their quiet pressure campaign has translated to tougher EU action on Huawei. Asked for specifics about their diplomacy, the senior State Department official said the White House has put Germany's close ties with Huawei front and center during the four ministerial-level meetings of the EU-YOU.S. Trade and Technology Council since 2021, a Biden-era initiative to coordinate transatlantic trade and investment policy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and YOU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai have attended each ministerial meeting, where they met with European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager. The TTC also features 10 working groups dedicated to specific issues in the YOU.S.-EU relationship, one of which is telecommunications. The National Security Council and the Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The European Commission responded by referring to its recent actions against Huawei and ZTE -- which the State Department official also highlighted as evidence YOU.S. diplomacy was having an impact. In June, the commission found that the two Chinese firms represent ... materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers. In recent years, it has regularly shone a spotlight on Germany and smaller EU states that have been struggling to remove Huawei gear. Publicly, cabinet-level officials within the Biden administration -- and the president himself -- have not talked nearly as much about Huawei as their predecessors in the White House. Several former YOU.S. officials, including Gorman, Steinman and Ivan Kanapathy, the deputy senior director for Asian affairs on Trump's NSC, question whether Biden's quiet outreach to Germany is sufficient to move the needle on Huawei. When only lower-level officials are talking about these types of problems, it has dramatically less impact than when someone at a much higher level is doing it, said Kanapathy. Skeptics of Biden's diplomacy are still more likely to blame Berlin than Washington for Germany's continued ties to Huawei. Even if it is less laser-focused on Huawei than Trump was, they acknowledge, the Biden administration has kept the heat on Chinese tech companies, from cutting off their access to advanced semiconductors to restricting Western investment in cutting-edge tech, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In August, however, Huawei started advertising a new smartphone that included an advanced, 7-nanometer chip. That breakthrough is raising sharper criticisms of Biden's approach to the telecommunications giant, even if many believe the development is not as impressive as China wants it to appear. In September, a group of ten Republican Congressmen sent a letter to the Commerce Department urging it to slap heavier sanctions on China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which manufactures the new chip, and Huawei. If enacted, those measures could potentially raise the price of Huawei gear and short-circuit the Huawei debate in Germany. But Krach, one of relatively few Trump administration officials who has continued to support the Biden administration's Huawei push since leaving his government, said the firm would remain a significant long-term threat to YOU.S. interests, no matter what happens with YOU.S. trade and export policy. When you have a competitor like Huawei, you could drive a stake into their heart, put them 10-feet underground, throw asphalt on them, and light them on fire -- and they will still come back, he said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Of course, the more Andrews refused to engage with their relentless attacks, the more enraged the media mafia became. They ramped up the crazy to collaborate with cookers. They invented conspiracy theories on a daily basis, contriving wild sub-plots of cover-ups behind everything from the serious accident in which Andrews suffered a broken back to a car accident involving his wife back in 2013. And proving once and for all that the national broadcaster can mix it with the right-wing media gang, ABC's News Breakfast chose UAP Senator Ralph Babet, along with The Australian's Rachel Baxendale to share their insights on Andrews' departure. Baxendale's blatantly hateful and puerile attacks on the Victorian Premier became a regular feature of Spring Street press conferences. The Murdoch employee refers to those Victorians who reelected Andrews for a third time with an increased majority as the Dan Andrews cult and will likely win a Walkley for her incisive interviewing skills. Such as when she asked the Premier why intimate partners did not have to wear masks when others did, to which Andrews patiently responded: The very nature of a platonic relationship between two people who are coming together to spend time with each other, that is very different to intimate partners who by the very virtue of the fact that they are intimate partners, their contact is of a different nature. I cannot quite believe I am having to explain that. But I am. And this inspired line of questioning: BAXENDALE: I have been told that then-Victorian deputy chief health officer Allen Cheng has resigned, is that true? ANDREWS: No, that is not true. BAXENDALE: But you said he was taking some time off, surely you can see that looks like he is resigned, would not you agree? ANDREWS: No, that is just not correct. Cheng took a total of one week's leave. Brilliant interrogations such as these notwithstanding, Dan Andrews somehow managed to turn up every day during the pandemic. He fronted a hostile press pack, enduring what can only be described as feral attacks on a daily basis. He faced an Opposition focused on getting the dirt on the Premier instead of providing a credible alternative government. There were death threats from emboldened far-right nut jobs. And a bellicose Federal Coalition Government and later, Opposition, who, even as late as this month, blamed Andrews for all that is wrong with the nation - nay, the world - plus a couple of things that probably have not happened yet. It was an unrelenting, coordinated misinformation campaign, in which conservative forces threw everything they had at the Victorian Premier for nine years, insisting Victorians wanted him out. And the more unhinged their attacks towards him while Andrews stared them down, the more voters turned away from the whole circus, returning the Andrews Government to power with an increased majority each time. Dan Andrews 'right to go' for third term Despite conservative media relentlessly campaigning against his success, Daniel Andrews' potential re-election in November would make him Victoria's longest-serving premier since 1972. It has been a long-held position of this publication that all non-conservative, let alone progressive, politicians should stop cosying up to their tormentors. It only ends in tears. With the announcement of Rupert Murdoch's retirement this week, sitting Labor MPs, while they have not waxed lyrical about the man, have hardly been openly critical, with many choosing to give him credit for building a media empire. Which is a bit like thanking Dr No for creating jobs for MI6. It would have been refreshing to see a sitting Labor MP step up and acknowledge what only ex-PMs, like Malcolm Turnbull (though not while he was Prime Minister), seem bold enough to admit about the media mogul. Turnbull listed the YOU.S. Capitol insurrection, the Trump Presidency and climate change denial among the many terrifying consequences of Murdoch's involvement, and described his legacy as one which: ...has done enormous damage to the democratic world. Turnbull also noted, unlike many of his party's ebullient praise for the Murdoch dynasty, that the passing of Rupert's media monstrosity helm to son Lachlan, will probably not see any change for the better. An accurate if sobering thought. Andrews leaves the top job in the state as the fourth-longest-serving Victorian premier. His legacy is one of significant social reforms such as a Treaty with Indigenous Victorians, the Safe Schools program and Voluntary Assisted Dying legislation. The Andrews Government infrastructure program has transformed Victoria and included the revival of the State Electricity Commission, the metro rail link, railway level crossing removals, the suburban rail loop, a range of road extensions and upgrades, plus a comprehensive plan to build 800,000 affordable homes over ten years. Andrews' policy platform actively embraced renewable energies rather than fossil fuels and, in a first for Australia, permanently banned fracking and coal seam gas exploration. Most recently, the Victorian Premier decided to scrap the outdated Commonwealth Games and ignored the backlash, saying simply: What is become clear is that the cost of hosting these Games in 2026 is not the 2.6 billion, which was budgeted and allocated... I will not take money out of hospitals and schools to host an event that is three times the cost estimated and budgeted for last year. But not everyone will agree with that. Of course, Andrews is not the only successful Labor leader in recent history to have survived the Murdochracy. Mark McGowan, the WA Labor Premier who all but destroyed the Liberal Opposition in that state, such that they almost did not qualify as a political party, had a similar approach to Andrews. He, too, led on his own terms, sticking to the plan and letting that state's media ramble on without effect until he was good and ready to stand down. Interestingly, neither leader can be said to be a beacon of radicalism, which hints at the level of progress Australians are happy to embrace. Nonetheless, Andrews and McGowan are tangible evidence that Australians are sick of spin. They are tired of being played by the Murdochs and Costellos and Stokes' of the world and they are fed up with political grifters who suck up to them for personal gain. Voters want political leaders who prioritise decisions based on the needs of the people, not to placate media moguls and assorted corporations. But not everyone will agree with that.

Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service declared a major incident at 9.38pm on Tuesday and, at its peak, had 15 fire engines, three specialist aerial appliances and more than 100 firefighters at the scene. Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer with the service, said as many as 1,500 vehicles were in the car park at the time - with up to 1,200 believed to be damaged. Holidaymakers who left their cars at the airport say they have been left in limbo and have received no help. In a statement, the airport said it is unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable but this was still in the process of being assessed. It said it had provided the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) with the registration details of 1,405 vehicles and, along with its parking provider APCOA, it had responded to almost 16,500 customer queries since the fire. An airport spokesperson said it recognised it has been an extremely distressing time for those affected and it was working with the Association of British Insurers to establish the possibility of safely retrieving any personal items from the vehicles. The airport said the emergency services have handed back control of the site and it is working to make it safe. 'An extremely distressing time for all concerned' A London Luton Airport spokesperson added: We recognise this has been an extremely distressing time for all concerned and we would like to thank our customers for their ongoing patience and understanding while we work through the many complexities following this incident. Dealing with such a large volume of inquiries, while an investigation is ongoing, has naturally extended our response times. Our team have been tirelessly working around the clock to keep customers informed of developments. We also advise all customers affected to notify their insurance company as soon as possible. The statement continued: We are working with the Association of British Insurers on behalf of the many insurance companies to establish whether it will be possible to safely retrieve any personal possessions and, if so, how this process may work. Until such time, it will not be possible to provide more detailed information or a specific timeline. We remain committed to transparency and resolution and will continue to provide updates as the situation unfolds. The airport's Dart rail transit system, which opened earlier this year, remains closed along with the car park.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The Federal Railroad Administration did not respond directly to the criticism of the rule requiring cameras showing both the train crew's actions and a view from the front of passenger trains. FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said freight railroads were not addressed because a 2015 law Congress passed only required regulators to establish a rule for passenger railroads. But many freight railroads, including all the biggest ones that handle a majority of shipments nationwide, have installed cameras voluntarily, starting with outward-facing cameras and later adding ones showing the crews' actions. The cameras are less common on smaller railroads. A spokeswoman for the American Short Line and Railroad Association said only a few short-line railroads have them and most of those are only outward-facing cameras. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement that the FRA's belief that the cost 'could outweigh the safety benefits' is an affront to every community that is experienced a freight or freight-passenger rail disaster. The Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February did have cameras, but Ms. Homendy said that because there are no federal standards for those cameras, investigators have only 20 minutes of footage from before that derailment. Though many in the freight rail industry have opted to install recorders voluntarily, there is absolutely no standard for the number of hours of data they must preserve after an accident, Ms. Homendy said. East Palestine is a striking example: instead of having 12 hours' worth of in cab video, as we have recommended, our investigators only have access to a 20-minute recording -- not nearly enough to help us or the FRA identify critical safety improvements needed to prevent similar accidents from reoccurring. Ms. Homendy said the new rule also fails to require audio recordings inside the cabs of locomotives. The NTSB made its recommendation to add cameras in locomotives in 2010 after it investigated the deadly 2008 collision between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California. That crash killed 25 people, including the Metrolink engineer, and injured more than 100. But the NTSB said such cameras would have been useful in dozens of other crashes because they can help determine what caused them, particularly when the train crew was killed or cannot remember key details. Investigators determined that the Metrolink engineer was sending and receiving text messages on his cell phone before the crash, and he ran a red signal light before slamming into the Union Pacific freight train. Congress responded to that Chatsworth collision by requiring railroads to develop and install an automatic braking system that might have prevented it -- something that took more than a decade and roughly 15 billion to complete. And regulators banned cell phone use by train operators. Later, lawmakers also required regulators in the 2015 law to look at requiring locomotive video recorders for passenger trains. Amtrak pledged in 2015 to install cameras on its trains after a crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured about 200. This new rule will require cameras on all intercity commuter and passenger trains as well. While video recorders cannot directly prevent accidents, they help maintain a higher standard of safety, said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. In addition, these devices play a vital role in post-accident investigations, providing valuable evidence that helps us understand the circumstances leading to the accident and take appropriate action to prevent similar accidents in the future.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

They depict more than 1,000 containers of 'equipment and munitions' being carried on a Russian-flagged ship out of North Korea (DPRK), he said. The containers were then loaded on a train, which transferred them to a depot near Russia's south-western border, according to Washington's analysis of the images. Mr Kirby added: 'We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians, and further Russia's illegitimate war.' In return for the arms, North Korea is seeking its own military support from Russia, including missiles and fighter aircraft, Mr Kirby said. Washington thinktank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies released images last week showing a 'dramatic and unprecedented' increase in freight traffic at North Korea's Tumangang Rail Facility, near the border. He cited further satellite images showing Russian ships appearing to unload in North Korea that may indicate these deliveries may have already begun. Kim cast an eye over nuclear-capable bombers, hypersonic missiles and warships used by the Russian military when he toured the Knevichi airfield on his visit last month.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, and the pro-government Al-Watan daily said an airstrike had hit the runway at Aleppo's international airport on Saturday - hours after it had repairs had been completed following a similar strike on Thursday. Israeli military did not confirm the airport attack but said it had struck targets in Syria as it fired back following air raid sirens in two villages in northern Israel and the Golan Heights. Hamas announced on Sunday that three of its members from Lebanon had been killed after crossing the border from Lebanon into Israel. The group said in a statement that its militants had inflicted losses before being targeted by Israeli airstrikes Israel's military warned in a statement on its website on Saturday night it is preparing to implement a wide range of offensive operative plans involving air, ground and naval forces. No time has been put on when the offensive will begin, but a military spokesman said Israel will strike Gaza City very soon. In an address on Saturday night, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari issued a new appeal to residents to move to the southern Gaza Strip. Palestinians are struggling to flee from areas of Gaza targeted by the Israeli military while grappling with a water and medical supplies shortage. Israel has ordered roughly half of Gaza's population to evacuate their homes and renewed calls on social media and in leaflets dropped from the air for Gaza residents to move south, while Hamas urged people to stay in their homes. The UN and aid groups say such a rapid exodus along with Israel's siege of the 25-mile-long territory would cause untold human suffering. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the evacuation could be tantamount to a death sentence for the more than 2,000 patients in northern hospitals, including newborns in incubators and people in intensive care. Gaza's hospitals are expected to run out of fuel for emergency generations within two days, according to the UN, which said that that would endanger the lives of thousands of patients. A planeload of WHO supplies has landed at Egypt's el-Arish airport and is destined for Gaza when humanitarian access across the border is possible, the United Nations said on Saturday. The cache includes enough basic essentials for 300,000 people and enough trauma medicines and materials for 1,200 wounded, the UN said in a release. It called for opening the Rafah border crossing immediately to humanitarian deliveries. The critically injured, the sick and the vulnerable cannot wait, the world body said. The United States is sending a second carrier strike group - the USS Dwight D Eisenhower - to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Israel. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the additional carrier was being sent as part of our effort to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas's attack on Israel. The Eisenhower will join the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group, which is already sailing near Israel, to bolster US presence there with a host of destroyers, fighter aircraft and cruisers.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

And it is bad for Ukraine","The White House announced on October 13 that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition to bolster Russia's war against Ukraine. Washington published pictures tracking a set of containers as it traveled from Najin, North Korea, to Dunay, Russia, by a Russian-flagged vessel. The supplies were then reportedly moved by rail to an ammunition depot in southwestern Russia near Tikhoretsk, roughly 200 kilometers from Ukraine's state border. We condemn (North Korea) for providing the Russians with this military equipment, YOU.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. The weapons would be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby added. While the news of an armaments delivery from North Korea to Russia was unsettling, it was not unexpected. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un arrived in Russia for a six-day tour of the country's far east last month, visiting an aircraft plant, inspecting the Admiral Shaposhnikov frigate, and meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Experts suggested that Moscow could furnish North Korea with the technology they needed for its struggling spy satellite program in return for Pyongyang's stockpile of Soviet-era weaponry - primarily artillery shells that could be used by Russian guns in Ukraine. The news of military cooperation confirms that we have entered a new era of Russia-North Korea relations. But it also poses a new question: What happens next for Moscow, Pyongyang, and the silent Beijing? Russia and North Korea have a longstanding relationship despite Pyongyang's zealous isolationism. In 2000, the two countries signed a treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation, and Moscow is one of just a handful of countries to maintain an embassy in Pyongyang. There have been multiple reports of North Korean hackers working from Russian territory, and North Korean laborers working in industries such as logging. But Russia and North Korea's relationship is not as simple or straightforward. Moscow has also supported numerous UN resolutions imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, including in 2010, 2013, and 2017. President Putin told reporters after Kim Jong-Un's visit that Moscow would uphold these sanctions, despite earlier remarks from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the resolutions had been made during a completely different geopolitical situation. Rather than an ongoing commitment, the latest chapter is more likely to consist of both sides exploiting global events to further their own ends. Moscow is looking not only for ammunition but also support for its aggression in Ukraine. North Korea is one of only a handful of countries to recognize Russian illegal territorial gains and consistently vote against UN resolutions supporting Ukraine. For now, the situation is still purely based on the idea that we will give you something, and we want something in exchange. There is no ideological cooperation, says Natalia Matiaszczyk, an expert at the Polish think tank Institute of New Europe. Support from North Korea is something Russia uses to legitimize its illegal actions on Ukraine territory. In many ways, this is as important as receiving the weapons themselves -- particularly as North Korea's ammunition stockpile is believed to be not only outdated but also of low quality. It is by no means certain that such ammunition could make a significant difference on the front line. But many outsiders underestimate North Korea's own agency. Pyongyang is also seizing a new diplomatic space that has opened up as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, says Yong-Chool Ha, director of the Center for Korea Studies at the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington. North Koreans have been suffering from the severe impact of the sanctions that have been imposed upon them, he says. But this is a new sort of opportunity and the evolution of a new diplomatic horizon, and we can see that in North Korea's behavior toward Russia. And while the invasion of Ukraine has given North Korea new opportunities, it does not mean that it is an issue that holds a particular imperative for Pyongyang. For North Korea, Kim Jong-Un's visit to Russia was more of a signal of the country's re-opening after Covid 19 than of the country's stance in European affairs. After more than three years of closed borders due to Covid, North Korea is now opening back up slightly. North Koreans who were based abroad are now being allowed to come back, there has been news that soon, even foreigners will be allowed to visit. This is a huge change in domestic policy, says Tereza Novotna, a Korea-Europe Center Fellow at the Free University Berlin. Novotna points out that it was not just military facilities that featured in Kim Jong-Un's Russian itinerary. Kim Jong-Un also visited both an aquarium (where the North Korean leader was applauded by a walrus) and the ballet (although Russian news outlets reported he left after the first act). After the lockdown ended in Europe, we were so happy to finally go on vacation, says Novotna. Well, Kim Jong-Un's lockdown just ended now, and he went on vacation too. North Korea, however, is unlikely to provide Moscow with ammunition purely as thanks for a pleasant post-Covid trip. If Pyongyang shipped shells to Russia, what can it expect in return? Despite Putin's public remarks, it remains unclear whether the Kremlin could defy international sanctions and supply military technology to Pyongyang. In his October 13 press conference, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believed Pyongyang wanted advanced Russian technologies for the North Korean military and nuclear program. Other experts believe that other types of technological exchange could be more likely. North Korea has recently been working on a satellite program but has so far faced two failed launches, says Matiaszczyk. Maybe that is what North Korea wants from Russia, a new technology that will help successfully send these satellites into orbit, she says. Real exchange between Moscow and Pyongyang is also likely to be hampered by the reaction of officials in Beijing. China is North Korea's largest trade partner, and Pyongyang relies heavily on Beijing's economic aid. Increased cooperation with Russia could be an attempt to reduce that dependency -- but China will not want its influence in the region to be diminished by the Kremlin and could make their displeasure known. Beijing currently also hopes to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and good relations with a number of other global powers, says Matiaszczyk. Russian tech deliveries to North Korea could endanger both of these goals. In the context of the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese authorities primarily seek to prevent escalation. That is why in the past, when North Korea pursued aggressive politics and nuclear testing, China supported the UN Security Council resolution against North Korea, says Matiaszczyk. Tightening cooperation between North Korea and Russia will also force the YOU.S., Japan, and South Korea to deepen their cooperation, including militarily, and that is something China really does not want. Then there is the question of the UN Security Council. If Russia violates UN sanctions, then the council will be forced to meet to discuss the situation. Although Moscow would be able to veto new sanctions, the scenario would still see Beijing in a difficult position. If Chinese officials voted in favor of a resolution, it would damage ties with Moscow. Still, if it were to abstain or vote against, China's international reputation and relationship with the West could be further damaged. China would be in a very awkward position, says Matiaszczyk. That is not to say that North Korea would be unhappy to see Beijing face such an uncomfortable diplomatic conundrum. In fact, Pyongyang has always been skilled at playing international powers off each other, says Novotna. North Korea could well try to exploit such a situation to gain maximum benefit from both Moscow and Beijing. I do not think there is ever been much love lost between North Korea and China. China has always been seen as a country that North Korea is dependent on -- and that there is no way to avoid that, she says. Yet, ultimately, it remains unlikely that Russia could replace China as a partner for North Korea. I do not think North Koreans would like to alienate China at this point, frankly. I do not think Russia could be a substitute for China either, says Ha. China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea's trade -- not Russia. Some commentators have raised the prospect that closer North Korean-Russia ties could pave the way for a new geopolitical power bloc comprising of Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang. But, most regional experts believe this risk is largely overstated. Rather than having a single outlook, each of these three countries has its own goals, needs, and relationships with each other. Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang also have their own separate relationships with other Asian countries. Rather than China, Russia, and North Korea rushing to form their own three-state bloc, a looser Eurasian alignment that involves other nations, such as certain Central Asian states, could be a more likely geopolitical outcome, says Ha. He believes that Kim Jong-Un is increasingly concerned about North Korea's place in southeast Asia, particularly after the Camp David summit in August when leaders from the YOU.S., South Korea, and Japan met to discuss greater military cooperation. The North Korean leader would later describe the alliance as the Asian version of NATO, the root because of war and aggression, and claimed the start of a new Cold War. I think Kim Jong-Un's perception of the emerging regional world and what is happening surrounding the Korean Peninsula was a factor in this meeting with Putin, says Ha. With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the strategic world map also changed dramatically. The Camp David summit was a clear indication of that drastic change in the security environment not only around the Korean Peninsula, but in East Asia in general. But this wider regional picture means that European nations should also try to engage in wider dialogue on North Korean-Russian issues. NATO should maintain close cooperation with allies like South Korea and Japan both in political, economic, and also military aspects, says Matiaszczyk, and should at least try to work with China. Europe also should not dismiss the idea of engaging with North Korea itself. I would advise the West not to see North Korea through the lens of Russia or Moscow's war on Ukraine, says Novotna. Now that North Korea is re-opening, it is a good moment to kind of restart European engagement with North Korea, and to think again about how to do it better than we did before, she says. It would be good to think about how to do this without putting Pyongyang into the same basket as Russia or Beijing and thinking of them as one entity because once we start doing this, that is what is actually going to happen, Novotna adds.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Syrian state television reported: Israeli attack at the international airport of Aleppo, northern Syria. Following the attack, the airport, which was renovated on Friday, was shut down. No injuries were reported, only damage to the tarmac. According to Assad-aligned media outlets, a combined Israeli strike was carried out on Thursday at both Damascus International Airport and Aleppo International Airport. The Syrian Ministry of Transport said the two airports were out of commission due to the attack. The ministry reported that its teams began uncovering the damage caused to the takeoff and landing strips and clearing the ruins to make them functional again. Iran's foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was scheduled to land in Syria last week but ended up returning to Tehran. Abdollahian did show up in Beirut a day later to announce that Iran was behind the Hamas murderous attack on women, children, and babies a week ago. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that striking Damascus and Aleppo international airports was a warning message to prevent Iranian aircraft from landing at the airports and was not related to the shelling of the occupied Golan. Flights were turned to Latakia airport, hours after the two airports were targeted. SOHR sources confirmed that the two targeted airports had not witnessed any arrival of military shipments for the Iranian militias, and the Israeli attacks put both airports out of service. Khmeimim Air Base outside Latakia in northwestern Syria is operated by Russia and is part of the Russian military contingency there. It is likely that the Iranian foreign minister landed there and rode by car on the shore highway to Beirut. This puts Russia squarely on the side of the Hamas murderers.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

At his farm in northeastern Nigeria, he can no longer afford enough fertilizer, so his corn is stunted and pale, the scraggly plants bending toward the powdery earth. Inside his mud house, he has grown accustomed to explaining to his two young children and pregnant wife why they must make do with two meals a day -- and sometimes only one -- even as hunger gnaws. As he and his neighbors commiserate over the calamity unfolding across much of Africa, they exchange theories on one source of trouble: Russia's war on Ukraine, which disrupted shipments of key ingredients for fertilizer. We are in two different worlds, separated by airplanes and oceans, Mr. Chubado said. How can it be affecting us here? That question is reverberating in many lower-income countries. Farmers are grappling with shocks that made fertilizer scarce and unaffordable, diminishing harvests, raising food prices and spreading hunger. The war in Ukraine reduced the region's grain exports and sent the price of staples like wheat soaring from Egypt to Indonesia. The world's food supply is also menaced by the ravages of climate change -- heat waves, drought, floods. Now, scarce and expensive fertilizer is combining with these other forces to threaten livelihoods. The breakdown in fertilizer production challenges the orthodoxy that has dominated international trade for decades. Prominent economists have promoted globalization as insurance against upheaval. When factories in one place cannot produce goods, they can be summoned from somewhere else. Yet as farmers across Africa and parts of Asia contend with fertilizer shortages, their anguish attests to a less celebrated aspect of the interlinked economy: Shared dependence on vital products from dominant suppliers yields widespread danger when shocks emerge. The crisis started with the Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the cost of transporting fertilizer ingredients. Then came the war. Finally, over the last 18 months, the YOU.S. Federal Reserve aggressively lifted interest rates to choke off domestic inflation. That has lifted the value of the American dollar against many currencies. Because fertilizer components are priced in dollars, they have become vastly more expensive in countries like Nigeria. Since February 2022, the price of fertilizer has more than doubled in Nigeria and 13 other countries, according to a survey by ActionAid, an international relief group. Concern about food insecurity has been alarmingly high in much of West and Central Africa, according to a World Bank bulletin. In Nigeria alone, Africa's most populous country, nearly 90 million people -- roughly two-fifths of the nation -- suffer from insufficient food consumption, according to data from the World Food Program. In conversations with three dozen people engaged in growing crops, trading food and distributing fertilizer in northeastern Nigeria, a sense of bewilderment is palpable alongside desperation. Farmers are shifting from growing staples like rice and corn to less valuable crops like soybeans and peanuts, which require less fertilizer. Thieves are stealing harvests. Wives are leaving husbands and returning to families with greater access to food. Parents are pulling children out of school for a lack of tuition money. Upward mobility has yielded to the imperative to hang on. Mr. Chubado, 27, is eager to send his children to university. He typically uses some of his crop to feed his family while selling the rest to raise cash. Yet with no extra crop to sell this year, he recently moved his 10-year-old son, Abubakar, from a private school where classes are no larger than 20 to a government school where 70 children crowd into classrooms. He cannot afford to buy the usual three school uniforms, so Abubakar must make do with one. Some days, his son complains that his uniform is too dirty and refuses to go to school. The Pandemic Shock Faced with extraordinary prices for inorganic or commercial fertilizers, some farmers are shifting to organic varieties, including animal manure. Longer term, that is better for soil, food quality and public health, experts say. But it can take years for crops grown with organic fertilizers to approach the yields achieved through the use of commercial varieties. In Nigeria, home to more than 220 million people, the highest priority is the immediate pursuit of additional food. At least for now, inorganic fertilizers remain a crucial means of adding vital nutrients like nitrogen and potassium to soils. Inorganic fertilizer is a global enterprise, one dominated by producers in the United States, China, India, Russia, Canada and Morocco. Nigeria has several fertilizer factories that produce varieties of nitrogen fertilizer, but they export nearly everything to South America. As a result, the country is vulnerable to any break in the global supply chain. The pandemic delivered a colossal blow. When making and blending fertilizer, Nigeria imports phosphates mined in Morocco, shipping them to the port of Lagos. Over the first two months of the pandemic, as commercial activity froze, shipping companies reduced their ports of call in sub-Saharan Africa by roughly one-fifth, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Then, as regular shipping schedules resumed, Lagos was overwhelmed by a cargo backlog. Seeking easier passage, fertilizer manufacturers diverted shipments to Port Harcourt, about 370 miles down the coast. But rampant piracy in the area entailed higher costs for insurance and freight. In March 2021, a massive container ship ran aground in the Suez Canal, closing that artery of trade and sending global shipping prices skyward. The cost of phosphates from Morocco delivered to Nigeria grew to more than 1,000 per ton, from 300 to 400. You had all those problems compounding supply, said Gideon Negedu, executive secretary of the Fertilizer Producers and Suppliers Association of Nigeria. Then, just as supply was recovering, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Consequences of Conflict For fertilizer producers, the most immediate effect of the war was its impact on energy prices. Nitrogen fertilizers are made through a chemical process that consumes energy, typically natural gas. As the United States, Europe and other governments enforced sanctions against Russia -- a major gas producer -- the price rose. The war also limited access to potash, an important source of potassium. Mining potash is a major industry in Belarus, a Russian ally. Even before the war in Ukraine, Belarus confronted international restrictions on its sales. Russia is another major supplier. American and European sanctions on Russia and Belarus include exemptions intended to allow trade in agricultural commodities. But much of the potash coming out of Belarus -- a landlocked country -- has traditionally been shipped from Lithuania, which has barred rail access since last year. Fertilizer manufacturers could not simply forgo phosphates and make products with the other key nutrients, nitrogen and potassium. Many crops require all three. Mr. Negedu's trade association represents 80 fertilizer blending plants and 500 large distributors around Nigeria. In pursuit of potash, the association pivoted to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, contending with stiff competition from much larger consumers of fertilizer from the United States and India, along with higher shipping rates. For much of last year, a ton of phosphates moved from Canada to Nigeria ran 1,350 -- a roughly fivefold increase over the price before 2020. Scarce Fertilizer In the dusty city of Gombe, Kasim Abubakar, 28, a fertilizer merchant, contemplated his diminishing stocks with a deepening sense of dread. It was July 2022, five months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of the peak season for farmers applying fertilizer. He placed an order for 700 bags of urea -- a form of nitrogen -- with a Nigerian manufacturer. Not until October, four months after the peak season, did he finally receive his shipment. This year, Mr. Abubakar ordered 2,100 bags of NPK, a mixture of the three primary nutrients, from an agribusiness supplier in Lagos. He prepaid the full balance -- 48 million naira, or about 61,000. Several weeks later, a sales manager informed him that production had been halted at the factory. Mr. Abubakar never received his shipment, while waiting four months for a refund. With limited inventory, his sales have dropped by half. In the Gombe area, a shortage of fertilizer worsened. For farmers with enough cash or credit to buy fertilizer, like Mohammed Sambo, 77, this was an opportunity. His 370-acre farm beyond Gombe is home to his four wives, seven children and 40 grandchildren. They live in mud houses that lack electricity and plumbing. Last year, with fertilizer prices climbing, Mr. Sambo and his family cultivated only 74 acres. This year, fertilizer was even more expensive. Still, they nearly doubled their planting and increased their use of fertilizer, divining that -- with other farmers retreating -- the white beans, corn and millet they grew would command a premium. They borrowed the money from a local seed company that provides technical advice along with fertilizer through a program forged by Mercy Corps, the international aid organization. The seed company waits for harvest until it collects its repayment. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Sambo's family proudly displayed its towering corn plants. One of his sons pulled back the silk on a promising ear to reveal plump white kernels. The family plans to fold its profits into expanding its acreage next year, eventually installing solar cells to generate electricity. But those who cannot afford fertilizer are triply cursed. They lack adequate crops to feed their families. They have nothing to sell to raise cash. Yet they must buy food at wildly inflated prices. Adamu Ibrahim, 28, a father of four, had hoped to sell some of his corn to generate funds to advance a crucial project -- replacing the crumbling mud walls of his home. Poisonous snakes regularly slither through the holes, menacing his family. He has been adding sections of cinder block to bar their path. But this year, he could afford to apply only half the usual fertilizer. On a recent afternoon, his corn slumped under the tropical sun. From the look of things, he said, my crop is only going to be for consumption. Impossible Prices By the time the cultivation season began in May, the ingredients for fertilizer were again widely available around the globe. The fertilizer market has stabilized, Mximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, said by telephone from his office in Rome. I do not see that much of a problem at this point. But farmers in much of Africa were still consumed with problems. The price of everything was going up. Fertilizer was available, but many farmers could not afford it. The cost of staple foods like corn, rice and beans was multiplying. So was the cost of meat, because livestock is typically fed with the husks of grains. In Washington, the Fed had been raising interest rates. Investors were selling a variety of currencies in riskier nations like Nigeria and buying suddenly more rewarding assets bought and sold in dollars. Over the last year, the Nigerian naira has surrendered nearly half its value against the dollar. The fall in local currencies increases the cost of all imports, including ingredients to make fertilizer. Fertilizer prices were far from the only source of distress for farmers. Catastrophic floods last year wiped out crops in northeastern Nigeria. In Abuja, the capital, the government eliminated subsidies for fuel this year, increasing transportation costs. And the inability to afford fertilizer makes it harder for rural families to overcome such challenges. Last year, Aisha Hassan Jauro, 40, a mother of five in the city of Yola, borrowed 100,000 naira (about 126) from a local bank at a 20 percent rate of interest. She used the money to buy fertilizer, seeds and pesticides while planting corn on her five acres. The floods destroyed her crop, leaving her with neither food nor cash, but still facing monthly loan payments of 17,500 naira (about 22). She and her husband buy spices and grains at a downtown market and sell them at higher prices in their village, earning enough for a single meal per day. They reserve their most nutritious food for the children -- fried dough made from cassava flour -- while the grown-ups subsist on boiled weeds pulled from their courtyard. They took their daughter out of university, where she was studying disaster management. Another daughter cannot begin seventh grade because they lack the 2,500 naira fee (about 3) for a required test. The land beckons as a potential source of recovery. But this year, with fertilizer even more expensive, they planted nothing. The Final Days For farmers accustomed to feeding their families, a trip to the market has become an indignity. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chubado arrived at the central market in Yola to supplement his meager harvest. He entered a labyrinth of muddy lanes choked with merchants. Boys wheeled wooden carts bearing eggs past women carrying baskets of plantains on their heads. Men stood over wooden tables, wielding knives to hack goats into fresh cuts of meat. The air was thick with the pungent smell of smoked fish, animal innards and diesel fuel, which powered clattering machines grinding corn into flour. Mr. Chubado bought spinach, a purple onion and a bottle of peanut oil for cooking. The oil was double the price of a year earlier, so he bought half his usual amount. He entered a stall where a man used a metal bowl to scoop urea from a large sack into two plastic shopping bags. I used to be able to buy a whole bag, Mr. Chubado said sheepishly. In Gombe, Juliana Bala has become acquainted with a sensation previously unknown in her 70 years -- fear of hunger. She raised six children in a house provided by her husband's employer, a local railroad. Neighbors traditionally shared meals with one another. But on a recent morning, Ms. Bala endured the hourlong trek to her farm, down a muddy, rutted trail, and was horrified to see that her crop had been defiled. Thieves had stolen half her corn. I broke down and cried, she said. How can someone apply their hard work and energy and then they take your harvest? Nearly half her annual income was gone, threatening not only her ability to feed herself, her husband and the six grandchildren they are raising, but depriving them of the savings they needed to buy seeds and fertilizer the next year. They no longer eat meat or fish, subsisting on porridge made from yam and beans. Crop theft was a new affliction. Ms. Bala took it as a sign -- that there were enough hungry people to stray into criminality; that the warnings she had absorbed from her Lutheran preacher were coming to pass. The final days were approaching, this the preacher had intoned for years. The pandemic was the first sign. The shortages of fertilizer and food -- spurred by a war -- seemed like the next one. And now, with half her crop disappeared, she could no longer feed the children. Life has changed, Ms. Bala said. I am scared that this is the end of the world.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, Safar-India, the AQI near Anand Vihar was recorded at 345 in the 'very poor' category, similarly, the AQI at the city's Burari Crossing area was recorded at 269. The air quality in Delhi's ITO area was recorded as poor with an AQI of 203, while in the Punjabi Bagh area, it was recorded at 236, which is again in the poor zone. The RK Puram area recorded an AQI of 239, at New Moti Bagh it was recorded at 267, while at Shadipur it was at 217, all in the poor category, as per SAFAR-India. The air quality in Noida also dipped into the poor category. Early morning visuals showed cars making their way through the smog-filled highway of the city. With the air quality index in Delhi dropping to the 'poor' level earlier on October 6, authorities in the National Capital Region (NCR) were asked to strictly implement measures under Stage 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). This included a complete ban on the use of coal in roadside eateries, hotels and restaurants. Air Quality Index is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms that are easy to understand. There are six AQI categories, namely Good Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. Each of these categories is decided based on ambient concentration values of air pollutants and their likely health impacts (known as health breakpoints). According to the AQI scale, the air quality check between 0 and 50 are considered good, 51 and 100 are satisfactory, 101 and 200 are moderate, 201 and 300 are poor, 301 and 400 are very poor, and 401 and 450 are severe and severe  when AQI exceeds 450. Earlier on October 9, during a press conference, the AAP Chief Spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, In 2022, the air quality in Delhi improved further by 8 per cent. In 2023, this improvement has reached 31 per cent. According to a report, in the last 8 years, excluding the COVID period, the air quality in Delhi has been the best in the year 2023.

This will also be the first time since the 2008 invasion of Gaza that Israel has attempted to capture and retain territory. Israel has subjected Gaza to the heaviest bombardment in its history. New Delhi: The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) geared up for a ground attack on the Hamas-held Gaza Strip today, in retaliation for the unprecedented land-sea-air assault on its territories that left over 1,300 Israelis dead. As Israel continued its airstrike on Hamas-linked locations in Gaza, Iran warned of grave consequences if the bombardment did not stop. Israel is poised for its most ambitious ground offensive since the 2006 invasion of Lebanon. This will also be the first time since the 2008 invasion of Gaza that Israel has attempted to capture and retain territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to eliminate Hamas after its deadly attack on civilians, the deadliest in the country's history. Israel has subjected Gaza to the heaviest bombardment in its history. This placed the region, home to 2.3 million people, under a complete lockdown and destroyed much of its infrastructure. To counter Hamas's multi-pronged attack, Israel, along with the combined might of its military and air force, has mobilised 300,000 reservists to fulfill Netanyahu's avowed quest to reduce Gaza to rubble. The planned ground offensive had not begun by the early hours of Sunday. But Why The Delay? According to The New York Times, the Israeli forces' weekend invasion plans were thwarted by cloudy weather, which would have made it difficult for pilots and drone operators to provide air cover for ground troops. Thousands of Gazans flooded into southern Gaza on Saturday after Israel warned them to leave before the possible ground assault. UN officials in Gaza said the Israeli military, which is massing troops at the border, had given them a 24-hour deadline to complete the evacuation. The Israeli army carried out localised raids in Gaza over the past 24 hours to clear the area of terrorists and weapons, and to locate missing persons. A potential full-scale invasion is complex, compounded by the fact that Hamas is believed to be holding many Israeli hostages in their underground bunkers and tunnels. READ  Hamas' Secret Tunnels: Israel's Tall Challenge In Ground Offensive Plan Hamas's labyrinthine tunnels under Gaza pose a major challenge for Israeli forces. Experts caution that Israel will lose its firepower superiority and be forced to engage the enemy in close combat if a ground offensive is launched. gaza, the densely populated area with its intricate network of tunnels is a key factor in israel's daunting security situation. An Israeli military spokesperson stated recently that they are attacking portions of the tunnel network, but it will be a grueling battle. Israeli military analysts say they fear that Hamas will use the hostages as human shields, creating a moral and operational dilemma for Israel. There are also concerns that Hamas will use the Israeli hostages as human shields to deter an offensive by creating a massive operational dilemma for Israeli authorities. Yesterday. the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a dire warning, stating that evacuating thousands of hospital patients to already overflowing hospitals in southern Gaza could be catastrophic and lead to a significant loss of life. The WHO emphasised that the healthcare system in Gaza is already on the verge of collapse and that the additional influx of patients could overwhelm it completely. The organisation also cautioned that the evacuation process itself could be dangerous for patients, many of whom are in critical condition after relentless Israeli airstrikes in the region. A New War Front? Israel also faces the possibility of a separate war in the other side of the country in its northern border with Lebanon after artillery fire exchange with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. Hezbollah's second-in-command Naim Qassem said the group was fully prepared to join its Palestinian ally Hamas in the war against Israel.

Israel has attacked an airport in northern Syria, according to reports in the neighbouring country, as it warned of a co-ordinated offensive in the Gaza Strip. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, and the pro-government Al-Watan daily said an airstrike had hit the runway at Aleppo's international airport on Saturday - hours after it had repairs had been completed following a similar strike on Thursday. Israeli military did not confirm the airport attack but said it had struck targets in Syria as it fired back following air raid sirens in two villages in northern Israel and the Golan Heights. Hamas announced on Sunday that three of its members from Lebanon had been killed after crossing the border from Lebanon into Israel. Israel's military warned in a statement on its website on Saturday night it is preparing to implement a wide range of offensive operative plans involving air, ground and naval forces. No time has been put on when the offensive will begin, but a military spokesman said Israel will strike Gaza City very soon. In an address on Saturday night, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari issued a new appeal to residents to move to the southern Gaza Strip. Palestinians are struggling to flee from areas of Gaza targeted by the Israeli military while grappling with a water and medical supplies shortage. The UN and aid groups say such a rapid exodus along with Israel's siege of the 25-mile-long territory would cause untold human suffering. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the evacuation could be tantamount to a death sentence for the more than 2,000 patients in northern hospitals, including newborns in incubators and people in intensive care. Gaza's hospitals are expected to run out of fuel for emergency generations within two days, according to the UN, which said that that would endanger the lives of thousands of patients. A planeload of WHO supplies has landed at Egypt's el-Arish airport and is destined for Gaza when humanitarian access across the border is possible, the United Nations said on Saturday. The critically injured, the sick and the vulnerable cannot wait, the world body said. The United States is sending a second carrier strike group - the USS Dwight D Eisenhower - to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Israel. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the additional carrier was being sent as part of our effort to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas's attack on Israel. The Eisenhower will join the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group, which is already sailing near Israel, to bolster US presence there with a host of destroyers, fighter aircraft and cruisers.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The ministry lambasted Israel, saying that the attack confirms the criminal approach of the Israeli occupation, accusing it of crimes against the Palestinian people. The Israel Defense Forces did not provide a comment on the claims. On Thursday, Israeli strikes knocked Syria's two main airports of Damascus and Aleppo out of service, in the first such attack since the Hamas assault on Israel a week ago triggered fierce fighting. Multiple reports indicated Saturday that the renewed attack on the Aleppo airport had come shortly after the runway was repaired and the airport went back into service. Earlier Saturday, the IDF said two rockets were launched from Syria toward northern Israel, setting off sirens in the Golan Heights town of Avnei Eitan. The IDF said both rockets landed in open areas, causing no damage. The military added that it had responded with artillery shelling toward the source of the rocket fire. The incident happened amid escalating fighting on Israel's border with Lebanon. War erupted after Hamas's October massacre, which saw at least 1,500 terrorists cross the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip by land, air and sea, killing about 1,300 people and seizing 150-200 hostages of all ages under the cover of a deluge of thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities. The vast majority of those killed as gunmen seized border communities were civilians -- men, women, children and the elderly. Entire families were executed in their homes and in some locations, the Palestinian terrorists reportedly mutilated their victims. Israel has retaliated with artillery and airstrikes, and officials from the Hamas-controlled health ministry estimate more than 2,200 Palestinian have been killed in the ferocious fighting, in addition to some 1,500 terrorists killed in Israeli territory. Israel says it is targeting terrorist infrastructure and all areas where Hamas operates or hides out, while issuing evacuation warnings to civilians in regions it plans to attack. Previous strikes this year, blamed on Israel, have repeatedly caused the grounding of flights at the airports in the capital Damascus and northern city Aleppo, both of which are controlled by the government of war-torn Syria. As a rule, the IDF does not comment on specific strikes in Syria, though it has admitted to conducting hundreds of sorties against Iran-backed groups attempting to gain a foothold in the country, over the last decade. Thousands of Iran-backed fighters from around the region joined Syria's 12-year civil war to help tip the balance in favor of President Bashar Assad's forces. The military says it attacks arms shipments believed to be bound for those groups, chief among them Lebanon's Hezbollah terror group. Additionally, airstrikes attributed to Israel have repeatedly targeted Syrian air defense systems.

As tensions continue to rise in the region, this incident marks Israel's latest military action against the war-torn nation. Confirming the strike, the Syrian defense ministry revealed that the Aleppo Airport, which had just resumed operations after being targeted by Israeli missile attacks earlier in the week, once again fell victim to Israeli aggression. This follows reports that the Damascus airport remains out of service in the aftermath of a separate airstrike. Remarkably, despite the gravity of the situation, the Israeli military has yet to respond to the incident. There was no immediate statement or confirmation from Israeli authorities regarding their involvement in the attack. However, sources suggest that these strikes serve a strategic purpose. According to various reports, the strikes are believed to be part of Israel's ongoing efforts to disrupt Iranian supply lines to Syria. Throughout the civil war, Iran's influence in the region has considerably heightened, and it aligns with the goals of several militant groups present on Syrian soil. By obstructing these supply lines, Israel aims to curtail Tehran's reach and destabilize its growing influence in the war-ravaged nation. As the situation continues to unfold, it is crucial to remain updated on potential developments. Further clarification from Israeli authorities is expected, shedding light on the motive behind the airstrike and confirming their level of involvement. The repercussions of these military actions will likely be felt far and wide, considering the implications they hold for the already fragile situation in Syria.

Iran told Israel via the United Nations it would intervene if operations in Gaza continued, a report claimed, as Israel readied a 'wide range of offensive operational plans' including a 'joint and coordinated attack on Gaza from the air, sea and land.' Diplomatic sources told Axios that while Iran did not want the conflict to escalate, it was prepared to intervene either directly or indirectly, such as via a military group in Syria or Lebanon. Schools in Lebanon remain closed amid fears of Israeli missiles targeting Hezbollah militants near the border. While Hezbollah has not formally joined the war, the group has clashed with Israeli forces several times this week. Reports broke around 1am BST on Sunday that the group had struck Israeli border fences with anti-tank missiles, hours after Israel told Hezbollah to stay out of the conflict with Hamas, warning that intervening could lead to Lebanon's 'destruction'. Israeli strikes also targeted the airport of Syria's government-held city of Aleppo injuring five people on Saturday, a war monitor said, days after a similar strike hit Aleppo and Damascus airports. Syria's defence ministry also confirmed the strikes, writing 'the Israeli enemy carried out an air strike from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea... targeting Aleppo International Airport, causing material damage to the airport and putting it out of service.' As tensions flare, the United States announced that it would be sending a second aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean. The Eisenhower will join the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group, which is already sailing near Israel, to bolster YOU.S. presence there with a host of destroyers, fighter aircraft and cruisers.

Hezbollah and other Palestinian factions in Lebanon have exchanged cross-border fire with Israel since Hamas's surprise October 7 attack from Gaza ignited a war that has killed more than 1,300 people in Israel. Palestinian gunmen also seized an estimated 150 hostages while Israel's retaliatory air and artillery bombardment has killed more than 2,200 people in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. A Hezbollah statement said the fighter was 'martyred while performing jihad'. A spokesperson told AFP he was killed in south Lebanon 'either in Israeli strikes or in clashes'. Two Lebanese civilians were also killed in Israeli shelling of the southern village of Shebaa, its mayor Mohammad Saab told AFP. Earlier Saturday Hezbollah and Israel said they had exchanged cross-border fire, with the Israeli army saying they had killed several 'terrorists' trying to slip across. Hezbollah said it had fired guided missiles and mortar rounds at Israeli positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms section of the border with Israel and the annexed Golan Heights. The Israeli military said it retaliated by 'striking the origin of the launches'. France on Saturday urged the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia to stay out of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, expressing concern at the situation on the Lebanon-Israel border. Paris also called for reporters covering the Israel-Hamas war to be protected after one journalist was killed and six others wounded in firing along the Lebanese border on Friday. Hezbollah and Lebanon must 'exercise restraint to avoid opening a second front in the region', of which 'the first victim will be Lebanon', the French presidency said in a statement Saturday. Reuters' journalist Issam Abdallah holds a kitten while posing for a picture in Saaideh, Lebanon, July 4, 2023 Reuters' journalist Issam Abdallah takes a selfie picture while working in Maras, Turkey, February 11, 2023 On Friday, Reuters confirmed a journalist working in southern Lebanon had been killed by an Israeli airstrike while at work. 'We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,' a Reuters statement read. 'Issam was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon who was providing a live signal. We are urgently seeking more information, working with authorities in the region, and supporting Issam's family and colleagues. 'Reuters journalists Thaer Al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh also sustained injuries and are seeking medical care. Our thoughts are with their families at this terrible time.' At least six journalists have been killed in clashes in the region since Saturday. Saeed al-Taweel, Mohammed Subh and Hisham Alnwajha were killed in an airstrike on Tuesday. Ibrahim Mohammad Lafi and Mohammad Jarghoun were reportedly shot dead while reporting on Saturday.

In a statement, the IDF said it was preparing to 'expand the offensive' with a 'wide range of offensive operational plans' which it says include a 'joint and coordinated attack from the air, sea and land.' Israeli army spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said on Saturday that Israeli forces are now 'in formation... all around the Gaza Strip, in the south, in the centre and the north' as Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu met with troops. Netanyahu's office said in a statement, and an accompanying video showed him telling them: 'You ready for the next stage? The next stage is coming.' Rights groups around the world have urged Israel to relent, warning of an impending humanitarian crisis after it gave an order to evacuate some 1.1mn people living in the north of Gaza on Friday. Israel was accused of breaking international law over the sudden order to leave, with aid agencies warning such an unprecedented evacuation was impossible. The United Nations urged Israel to withdraw the demand and said it would have 'devastating humanitarian consequences'. Amnesty International wrote: 'The initial announcement gave people 24 hours to leave northern Gaza for their safety and protection - an impossible demand that even the Israeli army spokesperson has admitted cannot be implemented in one day. 'Regardless of timeframe, Israel cannot treat northern Gaza as an open-fire zone based on having issued this order. Their forces have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians wherever they are in Gaza.' The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received an Israeli order to evacuate the hospital by 4:00 p.m., but would not do so because it had a humanitarian duty to keep providing services to the sick and wounded. Gaza has been under siege since October 9, restricting access to essential supplies of food, water, electricity, fuel and medicine supplies. Hospitals are struggling to keep the power on as beds fill up with wounded men, women and children caught up in Israeli shelling. Thousands were pictured travelling south along two designated 'safe routes', reportedly hit by explosions on both Friday and Saturday. The Israeli military's evacuation would force the territory's entire population to cram into the southern half of the Gaza Strip as Israel continues strikes across the territory, including in the south.

Protesters marching through the heart of the British capital were shadowed by a heavy police presence of more than 1,000 officers. Similar rallies took place in Manchester in northern England, Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland, and other UK cities. In London, demonstrators massed neared BBC News' headquarters before an afternoon rally near Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Downing Street office and residence.

An Israeli air strike coming from the direction of the sea struck Aleppo airport, Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP. Syrian state media also confirmed the strike, with state TV reporting an Israeli aggression targeting Aleppo International Airport.

Saturday's strikes hit the airport hours after it went back into service, knocking it out of service again, said the British-based monitor, which has a wide network of sources inside Syria. Israeli strikes have repeatedly caused the grounding of flights at the airports in the capital Damascus and northern city Aleppo, both of which are controlled by the government of war-torn Syria. During more than a decade of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its northern neighbour, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions. Israel rarely comments on individual strikes it carries out on Syria, but it has repeatedly said it would not allow its arch-foe Iran, which supports Assad's government, to expand its footprint there. Iran, which backs Hamas, on Saturday celebrated Hamas's assault on Israel, though it insisted it had had no involvement in it. The strikes were the second such attack on Syrian airports after Hamas's surprise October 7 attack from Gaza ignited a war that has killed more than 1,300 people in Israel.

Iran has become the focus of international attention in the wake of Hamas attacks on Israel that prompted large-scale retaliation as the make-or-break actor in what increasingly looks like a new war in the Middle East. While any war in the Middle East is a potential threat to oil supply security, one involving a producer the size of Iran could have even deeper implications for global oil markets. None of these implications are positive. Soon after the news of the attacks broke, there were reports claiming Iran, a supporter of Hamas, was involved in their planning. The information was denied by Tehran, while Israel and its biggest ally, the United States, said there was no evidence of Iran's involvement. Yet this did not stop YOU.S. Senator and vocal war hawk Lindsay Graham from calling on the YOU.S. to bomb Iranian refineries. That and similar calls from presidential hopeful Nikki Haley are essentially calls for an escalation of the conflict beyond sanctions, which many analysts see as the most likely course of action that Washington would follow. Such an escalation would quite probably send oil prices above 100 per barrel. Yet there is also another potential scenario where Iran is the actor taking a bigger role in the conflict. The main thing to watch for is whether Iran becomes actively involved in the conflict and the reason why is because of Iran's proximity to the really crucial waterway called the Strait of Hormuz, Rapidan Energy Group's global oil service director Clay Siegle told Bloomberg this week. Indeed, the Strait of Hormuz, in Iranian waters, is one of the biggest oil chokepoints in the world. The amount of oil that passes through the strait daily is around 17 million barrels of oil, which is equal to about 17 of global oil demand as forecast for this year. It is also equal to close to 90 of Middle Eastern oil that leaves the region via the Persian Gulf. The importance of the Strait of Hormuz occasionally makes headlines when Iran threatens to close it, which it does when tensions flare up between Tehran and the West. To say that tensions are currently flaring up would be an understatement, which makes the situation fraught with danger. The danger would spike -- and so would prices -- if we get to a point where Iran wants to close the Strait of Hormuz and the United States wants to keep it open. That would amount to a direct confrontation between the two that could not end well. For now, however, such a prospect seems remote. This is perhaps why prices have not really rallied after the Hamas attacks and Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza. Indeed, initially the benchmarks jumped but quickly retreated when the American Petroleum Institute reported a massive oil inventory build and the EIA confirmed it. Still, the potential for supply disruption remains significant. Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said this week that other fronts might open in the war, suggesting escalation is very definitely an option. At the same time, Iran's President talked with the Saudi Crown Prince as Saudi Arabia has taken the role of moderator, seeking to de-escalate the situation. Per an FT report on the conversation, Ebrahim Raisi said that both Iran and Saudi Arabia should defend the Muslim and oppressed nation of Palestine at this critical time. Saudi Arabia, which has been recently working on a deal to build diplomatic relations with Israel, has refrained from taking a side. The YOU.S., however, just stopped the transfer of 6 billion to Iran as part of a prisoner swap deal, and that would quite likely make Tehran angry. The money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran, earmarked for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate the acquisition of all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians, the Iranian mission to the UN said, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal. That might be the first step of a potential escalation, especially if the hawks in Congress take the upper hand. Even the International Energy Agency has made a statement regarding the conflict and its potential impact on oil markets. While there has been no direct impact on physical supply, markets will remain on tenterhooks as the crisis unfolds, the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report for October. The agency added it stood ready to act in case of a market disruption. The nature of the action remained undisclosed. Last year, the IEA, together with the YOU.S. released a massive amount of oil from inventories to arrest the oil price surge. As a result, the YOU.S. strategic petroleum reserve fell to the lowest in 40 years, equal to about 17 days of consumption, which makes a repeat of last year's release unlikely. An Iranian involvement in the war between Israel and Hamas would have a major effect on global oil supply security. Perhaps it is awareness of this fact that has motivated the diplomatic rush to an end to the fighting before it escalates.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office) The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a YOU.S. plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments had been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken and Kuleba discussed the latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The Federal Railroad Administration did not respond directly to the criticism of the rule requiring cameras showing both the train crew's actions and a view from the front of passenger trains. FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said freight railroads were not addressed because a 2015 law Congress passed only required regulators to establish a rule for passenger railroads. But many freight railroads, including all the biggest ones that handle a majority of shipments nationwide, have installed cameras voluntarily, starting with outward-facing cameras and later adding ones showing the crews' actions. The cameras are less common on smaller railroads. A spokeswoman for the American Short Line and Railroad Association said only a few short-line railroads have them and most of those are only outward-facing cameras. The Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February did have cameras, but Ms. Homendy said that because there are no federal standards for those cameras, investigators have only 20 minutes of footage from before that derailment. Though many in the freight rail industry have opted to install recorders voluntarily, there is absolutely no standard for the number of hours of data they must preserve after an accident, Ms. Homendy said. East Palestine is a striking example: instead of having 12 hours' worth of in cab video, as we have recommended, our investigators only have access to a 20-minute recording -- not nearly enough to help us or the FRA identify critical safety improvements needed to prevent similar accidents from reoccurring. Ms. Homendy said the new rule also fails to require audio recordings inside the cabs of locomotives. Investigators determined that the Metrolink engineer was sending and receiving text messages on his cell phone before the crash, and he ran a red signal light before slamming into the Union Pacific freight train. Congress responded to that Chatsworth collision by requiring railroads to develop and install an automatic braking system that might have prevented it -- something that took more than a decade and roughly 15 billion to complete. And regulators banned cell phone use by train operators. Later, lawmakers also required regulators in the 2015 law to look at requiring locomotive video recorders for passenger trains. Amtrak pledged in 2015 to install cameras on its trains after a crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured about 200. This new rule will require cameras on all intercity commuter and passenger trains as well.

John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesperson said the equipment will be used against innocent Ukrainians. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, said Mr Kirby, referring to North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In return for support, we assess Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. Satellite images released by Washington on Friday did not show the contents of the containers. Pyongyang and Moscow have consistently denied US reports of North Korean ammunition deliveries to Russia dating back to last year. Speculation that a deal was being brokered for Pyongyang to replenish Russian stocks was reignited in early September when Kim Jong Un, North Korea's leader, travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin, visiting key military sites. The details of their talks over a lavish lunch were not publicised, but US intelligence officials suggested at the time that Moscow would likely seek artillery shells and anti-tank missiles from North Korea, possibly in exchange for advanced satellite and nuclear-powered submarine technology. The latest images released by the White House were said to show the containers loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The US said the containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, a seaport near Vladivostok in Russia. Nuclear threat It unveiled the new intelligence as North Korea threatened again to use nuclear weapons to defend itself after the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and its battle group in the southern South Korean port of Busan. Last week the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), also published satellite photos that it said showed a dramatic and unprecedented increase in freight railcar traffic along North Korea's border with Russia. The CSIS report said that the contents of the covered containers at the rail station were probable weapons shipments. However, an analysis by the Seoul-based NK Pro website concluded that on-the-ground photos from the border indicated the tarp-covered goods were for disinfection, meaning it was more likely that the goods were imports from Russia to North Korea, which is only just reopening after the pandemic.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The Israel Defense Forces warned residents to evacuate from Gaza's north -- home of its largest population center, Gaza City -- on Friday, and the deadline has passed. After the surprise assault October 7, Israel placed the territory under siege, cutting off basic utilities. Today, Gaza is almost out of clean water, food, fuel and medical supplies. There has not been electricity in days, and its largest hospital, Al-Shifa, is now a shelter for 35,000 people, with men sleeping in the parking lot and women inside. There is little safety even for those fleeing. An airstrike hit a convoy of people trying to head south on a road that was supposed to provide safe passage. Among the dead were children and women, lying in pools of blood near vehicles. Ambulances were also struck. We are dying, and everyone is watching. Shame on you, all the Arab countries. We were told to leave, but where? Where to go? said Heba Al Attar, who is leaving a United Nations-operated school, which is supposed to be a safe place. They are shelling people on the roads, too. Where are we to go? More than 1,900 people have been killed in Gaza, and more than 7,600 have been injured. It has become a matter of life and death, YOU.N. officials said Saturday. Fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for 2 million people. The World Health Organization called the mass displacement a death sentence for the sick and injured. The clock is ticking. The Israeli military has amassed its forces at the Gaza border. It is preparing to implement a wide range of offensive operative plans, which will include an integrated and coordinated attack from the air, sea and land. Meanwhile, Hamas, which rules Gaza and is considered a terrorist group by the YOU.S. and the European Union, has posted propaganda videos showing it training for an invasion by attacking a mock Israeli tank and taking a person acting as a wounded soldier into its vast tunnel system. The objective of the coming attack, said Israel's national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, is to eliminate Hamas and its military and governmental capabilities so there is no way for them to resurrect from it. He added, Hamas will not rule Gaza. Speaking of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, he said, We will not stop until we know what happened to them and do whatever we can to bring them back. Israeli troops Saturday also recovered the bodies of a number of civilians that were strewn in open areas of Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman said. Hamas killed at least 1,300 people in Israel -- including 258 soldiers -- the worst terrorist attack there in decades. The coordinated assault targeted kibbutzim, a music festival and people on the streets. Babies, the elderly and families were shot and butchered, with the prime minister posting photos of burned infants on social media. More than 3,300 people were injured. In the darkness of night Saturday into Sunday, the skyline of Gaza City was black, with only a few lights flickering. On the Israeli side of the border, the sounds include the buzz of drones and fighter jets overhead. Tanks on flatbeds drive along the road. It is a difficult place, not safe, as we thought at first, Hasan al Attar, 18, said of living at a school acting as a YOU.N. refugee camp. We live here without water, electricity and internet. We have a lot of rockets above us, and no place is safe in Gaza right now, he said, adding, There is a lot of people still here like us, because there is no safe ground. They kill a lot of people. The medical system in Gaza is on the brink. Two hospitals no longer provide service -- one is a children's hospital -- and 15 have been damaged, and 28 staffers were killed, Palestinian Health Minister Mai Al-Kaila said. Saturday on the streets of Gaza, people stacked and strapped mattresses atop small white pickup trucks; others used donkey-drawn carriages to leave with their belongings. Some carried them on their heads down busy roads. Children waited in line to fill plastic jugs with water. I am a civil man. Civil. I do not have a gun. I do not have an air force. I do not have an F-16, a 48-year-old Palestinian in northern Gaza said. I want to tell all the people of the world: Rescue Gaza. Help Gaza. Please help Gaza. I do not know where I can go now.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Using satellite images, scientists at the British Antarctic Survey were able to see that sea ice in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea region last year broke up long before the start of the birds' fledgling period, when penguin chicks would have developed their waterproof feathers. The research, published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth  Environment, found that more than 90 of emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica could be quasi-extinct by the end of the century if global warming continues at its current pace. We have never seen emperor penguins fail to breed, at this scale, in a single season, Peter Fretwell, a geographic information scientist at the British Antarctic Survey and the study's lead author, said in a statement. The loss of sea ice in this region during the Antarctic summer made it very unlikely that displaced chicks would survive. The findings offer a grim outlook for emperor penguins and their habitats if global warming continues unchecked. The research is also of particular concern because Antarctic sea ice this year has plunged to record lows, far below extents that would be considered typical for this time of year in the Southern Hemisphere. Emperor penguins tend to return year after year to the same breeding sites, and typically lay their eggs from May to June during winter in Antarctica. Eggs will hatch after 65 days, but it takes until December and January -- summer months in the Southern Hemisphere -- before chicks grow their waterproof feathers and are able to leave the colonies to find food. In late 2022, Antarctic sea ice extent tied an all-time low that was set the previous year, said Caroline Holmes, a polar climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey who was not involved with the penguin study but has used its findings to better understand longer-term trends and anomalies across the southernmost continent. We saw a very early break-up of the sea ice and an early melt, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea region, where we have a lot of the penguin colonies, she said. Satellite imagery taken last November showed a total loss of sea ice in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea regions. As a result, Fretwell and his colleagues think, there is a high probability that no penguin chicks survived from four out of the five colonies in that area. In the study, the scientists wrote that some chicks may have survived on grounded icebergs but added that it is impossible to make those estimates based only on satellite images. If the current pace of global warming continues, more than 90 of emperor penguin colonies will be quasi-extinct by the year 2100, the researchers found. Quasi-extinction does not mean all emperor penguins will disappear, but rather that the species cannot reproduce adequately to grow the population, and thus may be doomed to extinction even if some birds are still alive. We know that emperor penguins are highly vulnerable in a warming climate -- and current scientific evidence suggests that extreme sea ice loss events like this will become more frequent and widespread, Fretwell said in a statement. Holmes said last year's declines in Antarctic sea ice fit within a broader pattern that has been observed during almost a decade, with the past two years logging the lowest sea ice extents in 45 years of satellite records. Particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea, what we saw in November and December 2022 was really unprecedented, in terms of how little sea ice was there and how early that sea ice broke up, she added. While myriad atmospheric and ocean conditions contribute to variations in how Antarctic sea ice grows and melts each year, climate models suggest that global warming caused by humans is contributing to long-term declines. But more data is needed to untangle precisely what that means for the stability of Antarctica's continental ice sheets and the health of its ecosystems, Holmes said. Pinpointing those answers is crucial, she added, because sea ice declines this year are even deeper. Sea ice extent as of this month is roughly 850,000 square miles less than the median value from 1981 to 2022. That missing sea ice is equivalent to an area larger than Greenland, according to the British Antarctic Survey. Holmes said the study's findings are yet another alarm bell over the need to limit the impacts of climate change -- particularly a because certain amount of warming has already been baked into the system. Even if we drop our emissions, there is going to be a certain amount of ice melt that will still happen, she said. But, obviously the more we can limit emissions the better.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

A look at the Iran-backed militant group on the sidelines of the Israel-Hamas war,"Created with the support of Iran, Hezbollah set a mission to expel Israeli forces from Lebanon, while resisting Western influence in the Middle East. TYRE, Lebanon -- As Israel's military prepares for what appears to be an imminent ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, the Hezbollah militant group looms in Lebanon just across Israel's northern border. Hours after Hamas' brazen and bloody attack on October 7, Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery into Israel, which was met with an artillery barrage. Since then the tit-for-tat combat has continued. Early Saturday the Israel Defense Forces said it had struck a Hezbollah target in southern Lebanon in response to the infiltration of unidentified aerial objects into Israel. It came after Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's deputy chief, said Friday that the group is closely following developments between Hamas and Israel. We as Hezbollah contribute to the confrontation, and will contribute to it within our vision and our plan, he said. We follow the moves of the enemy, and we are fully ready. When the time comes for any action, we will carry it out. A Shia resistance movement with ties to Iran Formed in the early 1980s as Lebanon was wracked by a civil war, Hezbollah, sometimes spelled Hizballah or Hezbullah, is a Shia political party and militant organization. The name means Party of God. Created with support from Iran, the group set a mission to expel Israeli forces from Lebanon, while resisting Western influence in the Middle East. The organization brands itself as a Shia resistance movement within Lebanon that believes in the country's right to self-determination, while also pledging its allegiance to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Hezbollah's current leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was a member of the Amal Movement, a Shia militia that was one of the many groups vying for power during the Lebanese civil war, before he joined Hezbollah in 1982. Closely aligned with the Iranian regime, he took over as secretary-general in 1992 after Israel assassinated the group's co-founder and previous leader, Abbas Al-Musawi, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group's militant activity and support from Tehran has led the United States, the United Kingdom and other nations to designate it as a terror organization. But Hezbollah also has lawmakers sitting in the Lebanese parliament and provides numerous social services within the country. However, its popularity appeared to be waning in last year's parliamentary elections: The Hezbollah-led coalition won 61 seats in the 128-member legislature, a decrease of 10 members since the last vote was held four years ago. Fraught relationship with Israel While Lebanon was deeply entrenched in its own sectarian civil war between 1975 to 1990, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel were at odds just south of Lebanon's border. In June 1982, Israel invaded south Lebanon in pursuit of PLO fighters that had made the country a base a decade prior, according to Hezbollah: A Short History by Augustus Norton. Hezbollah rose to prominence as it fought to remove Israel's presence from the country until it eventually withdrew its forces in May 2000. Tensions simmered for the next six years until war broke out again on July 12, 2006, after Hezbollah fighters crossed into Israel and ambushed a group of soldiers, killing three of them and taking two others hostage. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery strikes, before it imposed a naval and air blockade. Israeli forces also launched a ground invasion. Over 1,000 people, the majority civilians, are thought to have died in the conflict, which formally ended after 34 days. Since then there has been low-level fighting as the sides have occasionally exchanged fire across the border. Hezbollah also committed itself to the destruction of Israel in its 2009 manifesto, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Brothers in arms Formed five years after Hezbollah in 1987 during an uprising against Israel's occupation of Gaza, Hamas was originally a faction of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas leaders consider the Lebanese group an ally, and Hezbollah announced its solidarity with Hamas this week following Hamas' multipronged incursion into Israel, which left hundreds dead. Both are backed by Iran. Claiming responsibility for rockets fired out of Lebanon toward Israel, Hezbollah said in a statement Monday that it stood with the victorious Palestinian resistance and the struggling and patient Palestinian people. But aside from these sporadic attacks, it has to date shown restraint -- consistent with the informal rules of engagement that have governed the cross-border conflict for nearly two decades. Stomach for the fight? Lebanon is currently undergoing a crippling economic crisis, driven in part by political mismanagement and an influx of refugees. Hyperinflation has made it nearly impossible for average citizens to afford the high costs of living in recent years, and the European Commission estimates that 80 of Lebanon's citizens are living in poverty. A number of Lebanese politicians criticized Hezbollah for even considering entering into another conflict with Israel. Sami Gemayel, a lawmaker with the Christian-aligned Kataeb Party, said in a statement Wednesday that Hezbollah was forcibly linking the Lebanese people to the conflict. We are not ready to see Lebanon be dragged into this war, he said according to a translation of the statement by Lebanese state media. Firas Maksad, an expert on Lebanese politics at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told NBC News earlier this week that the Lebanese public does not have an appetite for war. Even amongst the Shia community and Hezbollah's support base, there will be great resentment and Hezbollah will be at pains to justify and explain why they got involved in this war, he said. A wider conflict? National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said during a briefing Wednesday that the YOU.S. was clearly concerned about the rockets being fired out of Lebanon. The bottom line is, as I said, we are sending a loud and clear message: The United States is ready to take action should any actor hostile to Israel consider trying to escalate or widen this war, he said. A number of American naval assets, including the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, are now parked in the eastern Mediterranean, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Thursday as a warning to other groups that may attempt to get involved in the war. President Biden, he is been very clear that no one, state or nonstate actor, should try to take advantage of this moment, Blinken said. Were it to enter the conflict, Hezbollah would bring to bear vast supplies of advanced weaponry, advanced training and well-organized ranks of experienced troops who have been bloodied by more than a decade of fighting Sunni Islamist militants in Syria, perhaps dwarfing the capability of even Hamas. But it remains to be seen if Hezbollah will escalate its actions, or if Iran pushes the group into war.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Pyongyang has delivered more than 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions in recent weeks, National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday. Washington released pictures that it said showed containers loaded with arms on a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between 7 September and 1 October, between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. Speculation Pyongyang would start sending arms to Russia has been rife since North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, visited Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and see key military sites. In return, North Korea wants sophisticated Russian weapons technologies to use in its nuclear weapons development programme, Mr Kirby said. Satellite photos showing a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border were published last week by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Images dated 5 October, the Washington thinktank said, showed a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility, on the country's border with Russia. More than 70 railcars were identified, the centre said, whereas only around 20 were visible over the previous five years. The US has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. Last month, after meeting Mr Putin, the North Korean leader demanded an exponential increase in his country's production of nuclear weapons. It was time, he said, for Pyongyang to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the US in a new Cold War, North Korean state media reported.

OilPrice.com,"Tensions and increased weapon development hint at Russia's potential decision to withdraw, further eroding international arms control frameworks. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The Treaty on Open Skies. New START. For years, the pillars of international arms control have been crumbling: agreements signed by Washington, Moscow, and others during and after the Cold War aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear war, costly arms races, or overall military tensions. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty may be the next to go. Signed in 1996, the treaty was a major step to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology and keeping a lid on the arsenals of the world's biggest nuclear powers. Along with earlier treaties, the agreement, known as the CTBT, also aimed to reduce the spread of radioactive material that was blasted into the atmosphere and the oceans during the frenzied days of the Cold War. Here is the problem: The treaty never went into effect because a number of countries, including the United States, never ratified it. Still, most signatories -- including Russia and the United States, whose arsenals are by far the biggest in the world -- have abided by the ban. Now, however, Russia is making noises about backing out and de-ratifying the treaty. Here is what you need to know about the CTBT and its potential unraveling: How did It Come About? The United States and the Soviet Union, as well as Britain, conducted hundreds of nuclear tests between 1945, when the world's first atomic bomb was detonated in the YOU.S. state of New Mexico and 1961, when Soviet officials detonated the world's most powerful weapon, the Tsar Bomba. France joined the nuclear testing club in 1960; China, in 1964. The fallout, literal and figurative, from the testing led to a partial ban on atmospheric, oceanic, and space tests in 1963; underground tests continued to be allowed. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear device, further expanding the nuclear club. A 1980 test by China became the last atmospheric test by any country anywhere. Moscow's final test -- underground -- occurred in October 1990 on the remote Arctic archipelago called Novaya Zemlya. Britain, the United States, France, and China all conducted their final tests in the years that followed, prior to 1996, mainly underground. What is It Do? The CTBT basically bans all tests that result in a fission chain reaction, essentially a nuclear explosion. Signed in 1996, the treaty was sent out to 187 signatory countries for ratification, but it has never come into effect because of a group of holdout countries. Russia signed and ratified the treaty in 2000. The United States signed, but the YOU.S. Senate refused to ratify, citing concerns about verifying other countries' compliance with the ban. Despite nonratification, the United States has complied with the moratorium. China signed but did not ratify. Neither India, nor Pakistan, nor North Korea -- all of which have conducted open nuclear tests since 1996 -- is a member. The treaty does allow for states to conduct subcritical, or zero-yield tests. Those involve explosives and nuclear materials but do not result in a fission reaction, the reaction that gives atomic weapons their terrible power. Both the United States and Russia are known to have conducted such tests. Despite not ratifying the treaty, the United States does provide 33 million annually in funding for a system set up to monitor possible nuclear tests, as well as the Vienna-based organization charged with overseeing it. What is The Problem Now? As relations between Washington and Moscow have worsened, major treaties between them have also frayed or collapsed entirely. Washington unilaterally pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty in 2002, angering Moscow. Washington for years accused Moscow of trying to cheat on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty until it effectively collapsed in 2019. In 2021, Russia withdrew from the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows countries to conduct surveillance flights over one another's territories in order to observe weapons and military sites. Both countries have adhered to New START, which capped the number of warheads and delivery vehicles each could possess. New START's extension, by both Russia and the United States in early 2021, was a lone bright spot in the continuing erosion of arms control. But the agreement expires in 2026 and cannot be extended. Unless a successor treaty can be agreed upon and ratified, there will be no limits on the countries' arsenals after that year. Tensions over Ukraine have kept the two sides from even sending inspectors to one another's countries, as stipulated for in New START. Both countries have also moved to modernize and upgrade their arsenals. But in a sign of deepening distrust, the YOU.S. State Department suggested in a 2022 report that Russia had not adhered to the standard of zero-yield testing. So Russia Wants To Pull Out Then? For more than a decade, the Kremlin has increased spending not only on conventional weapons and force strength but also on modernizing and expanding its strategic arsenal. In 2018, Putin boasted that Russia was developing new weapons like an unmanned, nuclear-capable, underwater torpedo, and a hypersonic glide missile. He also bragged of the development of a nuclear-powered cruise missile -- the Burevestnik, which has had major problems. In recent years, researchers have been monitoring a surge of activity on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago: satellite imagery showing an uptick of construction at one or possibly two settlements that researchers had identified as sites for a possible test of a nuclear device or the trouble-plagued Burevestnik. A top Russian nuclear researcher called for Russia to resume testing, and on October 5 Putin announced a successful test of the Burevestnik, though he provided no details. Putin also opened to the door to Russia resuming nuclear testing, saying it could de-ratify the CTBT. A week later, on October 12, the speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, introduced legislation to withdraw ratification. The prospect of Russia withdrawing prompted alarm bells, including from the CTBTO, the Vienna-based organization charged with monitoring compliance. What Happens Next? Even if de-ratification ends up happening, as is likely in the Kremlin-controlled parliament, that does not necessarily mean Russia will start blowing up uranium or plutonium again, on Novaya Zemlya or otherwise. I think that withdrawal of ratification is a strictly political step -- leveling status with the YOU.S., said Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian Foreign Ministry official and arms control expert. I think the main motive is the perception that 'Russia tried too hard in the past and made too many concessions' and now 'We are not interested in arms control more than other countries.' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Duma's foreign affairs committee, emphasized that Russia would not be withdrawing its signature under the treaty or withdrawing from the voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. We are withdrawing the ratification, thus restoring legislative parity with the YOU.S. Congress, he told the newspaper Kommersant. It was especially important for the CTBTO to hear that revoking ratification does not mean that Russia intends to resume nuclear tests and implies that Russia will continue to fully participate in the work being done for the Treaty's entry into force, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's ambassador in Vienna, told the state news agency RIA Novosti. Still, it is not a good sign, experts say -- all the more so, given the demise of other treaties. Russia or any major nuclear power backing out of the CTBT would be a huge blow to the global nonproliferation regime and would undoubtedly lead to a cascade of nuke testing by other states, Lynn Rusten, a former YOU.S. arms control negotiator, told RFERL. There could also be other nonproliferation or arms control treaties that are at risk, since, according to Sokov, the Kremlin has initiated a review of all similar agreements. One strong candidate for de-ratification or a downgrading of Russia's involvement, he said, is the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention, which obligates members to destroy their stocks of chemical weapons. Russia's compliance with that treaty has been in question since the near-fatal poisonings of former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal in England in 2018 and opposition activist Aleksei Navalny in Siberia in 2020. In both cases, Western scientists identified a powerful Soviet-era nerve agent and suggested that Russia had maintained a secret, undeclared chemical weapons program.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Benjamin Okezie Kalu says the South East geo-political zone losses over N13 billion due to disruption in the movement of goods between the north and the southern part of the country. This is as the Deputy Speaker unveiled the mechanism as Peace In The South East (PISE) project aimed at restoring normalcy in the zone. Relying on available statistics, Kalu said that the south East looses an estimated N10 billion to N13 billion in the transportation sector alone on every sit-at-home day. The Deputy Speaker made the submissions during a courtesy call on him by the Nigerian Association Of Small And Medium Enterprises (NASMEs) led by its President, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima in his office on Friday in Abuja. Kalu said that insecurity in the region was affecting the small and medium enterprises which he recognized as a major contributor to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He however assured the commitment of the House to review the laws that are inhibiting the operations of the SMEs in the country. He said: According to recent data, SMEs account for 48 of the National GDP in emerging economies, additionally the World Bank report SMEs play pivotal role in job creation. Therefore, up scaling entrepreneurship because its strategic imperative to revitalizing the Nigerian economy. SMEs must be seen as a strategic tool to our economic development. As legislators, we are aware of security problems facing our nation. In recent years, the security situation has posed hurdles. The sit -at-home in the South East has affected the movement of goods between the north and the south. It ought not to be so. Why this issue affects the entire nation. We can examine specific examples. Our businesses are going down and most of our businesses are SME businesses and the security challenges are suffocating the SMEs businesses in their numbers. Also billions and trillions of Naira are being lost to the sit at home order. There are other parts of the country where insecurity has suffocated SMEs and something must be done about this. It is disheartening to note that the ongoing insecurity in the region will have a profound impact to trade and socioeconomic outcomes. Statistics from SBM Intelligence revealed that the south East looses an estimated ten billion naira to 13 billion in the transportation sector alone, every sit at home day. Traders on the other hand face looses ranging from N5.4 billion to N31 billion daily. These figures are alarming and underscore the urgency of addressing the security challenges in the region. So if there is no reason for these non state actors to stop this, let this be their reason. That they are killing their own region with insecurities created by themselves. When you sit at home other regions are not sitting at home. When the SMEs in the south east suffer due to insecurity, the country suffers. It impacts the whole country. There must be legislative commitment in order to address some of your concerns. The SMEs are the backbone of every country. As legislators, we are committed to supporting and making laws to grow SMEs. My office is ready to partner with the association, we will find ways to review existing laws that will be not SMEs friendly. We believe that by creating more enabling environment for SMEs to thrive, we can address some of the economic challenges facing our great nation. Earlier in his presentation, the President of the Nigerian Association Of Small And Medium Enterprises (NASME) led by its President, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima appealed to the Deputy Speaker to help the body enact laws that will support the growth of SMEs in the country. On unveiling the PISE project, he said that that soon his office in agreement with all the lawmakers from the region irrespective of the political parties will reach out the State governors and other critical stakeholders for the launch and implementation of the project. He also said that the project will feature a regional security integration and political leadership that will streamline an agenda for the promotion of Igbo because and growth in terms of infrastructure. Kalu who made the revelations during a courtesy call on him by the national leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex socio-cultural group led by its President General, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu bemoaned the insecurity in the south east. He added that the sit-at-home observed in the region every Monday has crippled businesses and left the region empty. Kalu who vehemently objected to the sit-at-home order stated that Ndigbo must extend their handshakes across the federation to restore confidence. The Deputy Speaker also commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his benevolence to Ndigbo by ensuring that the people of the south east were accorded a place in the political hierarchy of the country. Kalu also remarked of his cordial relationship with the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, saying he will be delighted in accommodating the requests of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in stamping out insecurity in the south east. He said: Let me also state that, in our pursuit for these noble objectives, it is imperative that we draw a clear distinction between a legitimate call for justice, equity and fairness against criminal activities. There is a difference between the two of them. Criminal activities cannot be taken to mean legitimate call. Secession is not a legitimate call. We want to remain as one Nigeria! It is a distinction that our people must be able to make. And together we must ensure that the line is firmly drawn. Igbo Community has always been in the forefront of nation building and positive change. Go to any part of Nigeria, if you do not see an Igbo man there, it means that place is not progressing, it means that place is not prosperous. We are everywhere, nobody is as patriotic as the Igbo man. I am here today, not just as the representative of the people of Bende, but as a representative of all Nigerians. The House of Representatives is actually named the House of the People for a reason. The 10th House of Representatives led by my Principal, Rt. Hon. Tajudeen Abbas, who is currently in India and who has sent his greetings and who would love to host you when he is back, as we arrange your next visit, the Honourable Speaker himself will be here. And I want to say that I have a good working relationship with the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I want to report to you as the father of Igbo land that, I have a good relationship between me and this North Westerner, who is the Speaker. He does not discriminate, he does not undermine me, he sees the potentials and we are working together like twins to help Nigeria in the House of Representatives. With him, we will ensure that there is justice, with him, we will ensure that there is fairness, with him, we will ensure that there is equity to all, including the Igbos. We are not known for self destruction that is evident in the idea of sit-at-home or unknown gun men. It is not our thing. It is alien to us. We do not kill one another. We love our trade, we love our farms. We do not sit at home. Sitting at home is for lazy people. Igbo people are not lazy people. Those in support of sit-at-home are not Igbos. There is no true son of the soil of Igbo land that would support laziness and call it a strategy for secession. If you sit at home, you are a lazy man. Igbos are not known to be lazy. We are industrious, we are entrepreneurs, we work hard to succeed. The tradition of collective action and communalism has been a hallmark of the Igbo people throughout history, from building schools and hospitals to markets and farms. We are not known for self-destruction that is evident in the idea of sit-at-home or unknown gunmen. These tendencies are alien and abhorrent to how the Igbos are constituted; socially, culturally, and economically. In addressing our present challenges, we have the opportunity to draw on the things that pull us together. We may have different political platforms, but we must realize that the commonwealth and common good are ultimately the same. Onye aghana nwanne ya, he said. Earlier in his presentation, the President-General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu called for the release of the leader of defunct Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, saying it will help restore peace in the South East. Ohaneze has decided that we want Nnamdi Kanu released. We think that every effort should be made to release Nnamdi Kanu. If he is released, it is going to make it easy for us, he said.

Its claims are based on an image released Friday showing a shipment from an ammunition depot in North Korea, or DPRK, that was loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by rail to a depot along Russia's southwestern border. The delivery took place between Sept. 7 and October 1, the YOU.S. says. 'We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilian and further Russia's illegitimate war,' National Security Council Director of Strategic Communications John Kirby said Friday.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP) Kirby has disclosed that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions. He said that the YOU.S. believes Kim Jong Un is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions - to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime, Kirby warned. He noted that Washington is in lockstep with allies and partners to counter arms deals between Russia and North Korea by sanctioning individuals and entities working to facilitate such arms deals. We will not allow the DPRK to aid Russia's war machine in secret, and the world should know about the support that Russia may again provide the DPRK in return, Kirby said. North Korea on Friday lambasted the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it an undisguised military provocation and proof that the YOU.S. plans an attack against it. North Korea threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. Targeting Odesa Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, during a visit to the Black Sea port of Odesa, pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defenses and to increase the security of a 'humanitarian corridor' for grain exports. Zelenskyy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black Sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are a vital source of revenue for Ukraine's defense spending following Russia's invasion last year.

(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) 'We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole,' Zelenskyy said. The Odesa region has become a frequent target of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed upwards of 300,000 tons of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels already had been loaded with grain for exports and used a new 'humanitarian' grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian airstrikes during the winter, Rutte said Friday. 'This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So, the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric airstrikes,' Rutte said in Odesa. Rutte also said the Netherlands would help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Funding the effort European Union leaders meeting later in October will demand 'decisive progress' on using Russian assets frozen by sanctions to help Ukraine, according to their draft statement, addressing a matter that has been stuck for months. The United States and Britain last month showed support for an EU plan to tax windfall profits generated by frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine as Kyiv battles a full-scale Russian invasion begun in February 2022. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven, or G7, industrialized countries meeting in Morocco on Thursday estimated 280 billion worth of such assets had been frozen. They said they expected more work in the coming months to find legally sound ways of using them to aid Ukraine. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak joins other political leaders to view military equipment that has been given to Ukraine before they attend the Joint Expeditionary Summit on the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden. (Stefan RousseauPool via Reuters) Belgium, not a member of the G7 group, where most frozen Russian central bank assets are held, said it expects to collect 2.4 billion in taxes on the assets and use them to help Ukraine's reconstruction process, a spokesperson for Belgium's prime minister said Wednesday. Britain is planning to increase its military presence in northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, or JEF, defense cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. JEF, a defense cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to 'outside activity,' stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. 'This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent,' Sunak said in a statement.

The global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment. The emergency has grounded flights and sparked lawsuits, amid claims that a one-time DJ based in the South of England is at the centre of a ploy to pass off old parts with doctored papers. The fake parts scandal began in August when a document was circulated by European aviation regulators asking airline companies and their suppliers to investigate errant engine parts. Two months later and the true scale of the problem is emerging: TUI, Virgin Australia and nearly every major US carrier have been caught up in the crisis, which has forced the grounding of jets and delayed flights as operators try to weed out bogus components of unknown origin. Two Virgin Australia aircraft were withdrawn from use in September and earlier this month US giant Delta said a small number of its engines would need overhauling. TUI said it found one part it had then removed. The company said to be at the centre of the scandal is British-headquartered AOG Technics, founded and owned by 35-year-old Jose Zamora Yrala. Zamora has been accused by US engine giant General Electric and its French business partner Safran of large-scale fraud that they allege has led to fake or old parts being falsely installed into more than a hundred engines. His company is accused of falsifying the records that come with aviation components to show they are the real deal. CFM, a joint venture between GE and Safran that manufacturers engines, is now pursuing a legal case against AOG in Britain's High Court. Zamora is defending the case. Verification documents are important because of the exacting specifications of airline parts. Engine modules must tolerate temperatures that would melt many materials and even basic parts must be certified. Because of these demands, even a bolt can cost thousands of pounds if it is holding an engine in place. As a result, the market for airline parts is a very lucrative one. Since 2015, Zamora has charmed his way deep into the complex network of companies and decision makers who move billions of pounds worth of airline parts around the world. Business associates who worked with him outside AOG and who were willing to speak to The Telegraph describe a savvy operator who was fun to be around. Zamora, who is Venezuelan, got his start in aviation in 2010 as an account manager at AJW, an engine maintenance business, according to Bloomberg. A keen techno DJ, he was also gigging as recently as 2018 according to the Daily Mail. Zamora founded AOG in 2015 from a rented terraced house in Hove on the South Coast. It appeared to be small scale in its early years: the company's registered address moved between four homes in the following three years, shifting from Hove to London in 2017. Then, the company was registered at serviced offices in central London. Friends say they have not been in contact with Zamora in a number of months as he begins his defence in London's High Court. AOG's website appears offline but a cached versions says the company offered a diverse portfolio of quality products and services. With our head office in the UK and warehouse operations in London, Frankfurt, Miami and Singapore, we are uniquely positioned to support our customers around the world - 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the website read. We keep our clients flying. The company's phone line is still connected but offers only endless hold music. AOG is understood to have sold mainly smaller parts for jet engines, such as bolts, nuts, washers, dampers and seals. The parts do not carry a serial number and are therefore harder to trace. Worryingly, some bigger parts appear to be linked to the scandal. Some turbine blades have also been identified by CFM as suspect. CFM is understood to believe that AOG had been passing off old parts for new ones. Steve Borrowdale, managing director at Multiflight, a Leeds-based engineer and parts supplier, says sneaking parts into a jet engine is difficult. After vetting a seller for experience and approval certification, a buyer would also carefully inspect a part from a new supplier. You get the box, you would have a look, just for simple things. If there is a brand-new part coming in a non-identified box, you might start to question it. Choosing parts without serial numbers could make falsifying documents easier, he said, but it would still take great skill. You could not just take a novice off the street and start selling these things, you would have to have gotten some training somewhere along the way. According to filings at Companies House, AOG grew slowly from 2015 until 2019, when the company had net assets of 22,000. By early 2020, it was worth 2.2m. A breakthrough came when it won a deal with logistics firm BH Worldwide to distribute parts from its hub in Frankfurt. The two companies have previously worked together for exports to Europe and the USA from the UK but this is the first time they have partnered in mainland Europe, the pair said in a press release in 2020. AOG's cash bonanza came before the Covid lockdowns of that year, according to the filings. The pandemic grounded flights and was a disaster for the aviation industry. However, the end of lockdowns triggered a resurgence in international travel and a rush to secure jets and parts amid backlogs in factories. The parts scramble that followed would be a perfect breeding ground for an unscrupulous seller, said Borrowdale. Since Covid, raw materials are increasingly difficult to get hold off, he said. The supply of parts in aviation is through a dazzling patchwork of thousands of often small manufacturers, brokers and distributors. Manufacturers and operators are heavily regulated and largely responsible for orchestrating the paper trail that follows every aviation part, from computers and fuselage panels to screw housings and washers. CFM has had to audit more than 500 suppliers to try and find out what items could be caught up in the crisis. The parts so far identified in the forgery scandal are not thought to include the most sensitive components, known as life limited parts, which operate under the most stress in a jet engine and are carefully monitored by manufacturers while operating on the plane. However, even dodgy fastenings have claimed lives. Partnair Flight 394 crashed off the coast of Denmark in September 1989, killing all 55 passengers and crew after its tail fin came off. Three of the four bolts holding the fin in place were counterfeit and weaker than those designed for the plane. The weak bolts and other maintenance problems allowed vibrations that caused the rudder to fail and break off, investigators later found. Following that incident and other bogus parts scandals, Mary Schiavo, who was Inspector General at the US Department of Transportation in the early 1990s, ran a campaign against the sale of unapproved aircraft parts and helped secure more than a hundred criminal convictions. She uncovered bogus components that had been made by manufacturers that had lost their certification to make the parts, old equipment passed off as new, re-labelled defective parts and outright fakes that were never designed for aviation use. These are largely the categories into which bad parts still fall, she says. Unapproved parts were even found in part of a fire control system on Air Force One in 1995, she said. Literally, if it is on an aeroplane, it could be fake. Following her investigation, various reforms came in, including a warning system to flag suspicious components. I have had cases where counterfeit parts have caused deaths. What is at stake is the safety of the lives of the flying public. While plane and engine manufacturers, pilots and aviation companies are heavily regulated, distributors are not, she warns. She pushed for tighter rules in the 90s but was ignored. The High Court case against AOG began on September 21 and is ongoing. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has said it is supporting the US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency in investigating the matter. A spokesman for CFM said: We are working collaboratively with operators so they can promptly remove the unauthorised parts from their engines in accordance with the recommendations issued by the regulatory agencies. We remain united with the aviation community in working to keep unapproved parts out of the global supply chain. BH was approached for comment.

Bankman-Fried, whose stake in FTX and the Alameda Research hedge fund was once estimated to be worth as much as 26 billion on paper, faces seven decades in jail on a series of federal charges related to oversight of the now-bankrupt firms. The former friend Adam Yedidia was a college friend of Bankman-Fried at MIT and worked as a software engineer for FTX in 2021-22. He said he informed Bankman-Fried in June 2022 that 8 billion in FTX customers' cash was missing, and that they later discussed the missing money in person. He said Bankman-Fried seemed unusually nervous during their conversation, and acknowledged that FTX was vulnerable. Despite that, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried. In November 2022, when the business was collapsing and people were leaving, he wrote to him on Signal and said, I love you Sam. I am not going anywhere. Yedidia said that changed when he learned FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to Alameda's creditors, which he called flagrantly wrong. After that, he resigned. He was then asked why he lost faith in the company and quit. FTX defrauded all its customers, Yedidia said. The answer was stricken from the court record. The co-founder Bankman-Fried appeared visibly upset at times during the testimony of FTX co-founder and technology chief Gary Wang. He looked at the ground at times and once put his head in his hands while Wang was on the stand. Wang told the court about the days before Alameda and FTX failed. He said the firm's leaders considered shutting Alameda down, but could not because it owed roughly 14 billion and had no way to pay it back. Asked about a tweet by Bankman-Fried that said, Assets are fine, Wang said, FTX was not fine and assets were not fine. The star witness Caroline Ellison, Alameda's CEO and Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend, said that he told her to steal some 10 billion from FTX's customers and use it to repay firms that had lent money to Alameda. Sam directed me to commit these crimes, Ellison said near the beginning of several days of testimony. She also testified that Bankman-Fried instructed her to mislead lenders to make the firm's finances look better than they actually were -- a way to stop those lenders from getting nervous and asking for their money back. Ellison's personal relationship with Bankman-Fried was discussed at times during her testimony. While Ellison was on the stand for three full days, the two appeared to avoid looking at each other throughout. Ellison broke down in tears after prosecutors shared messages where she told Bankman-Fried that she was relieved the truth about FTX and Alameda was finally coming out. Ellison, like Wang and another top FTX executive, Nishad Singh, have pleaded guilty to a series of fraud-related criminal charges and are cooperating with the government's prosecution of Bankman-Fried in the hope of getting their own prison sentences reduced. The final days of FTX and Alameda Research Christian Drappi, a former software engineer for Alameda, testified about the final days before FTX and Alameda failed. He said Ellison told him that FTX had a shortfall of users funds because Alameda had been borrowing them. He said he was shocked to learn about that. While Drappi was on the stand, the prosecution played a recording of a company meeting led by Ellison. It was secretly taped by another employee who gave it to Drappi. In the recording, Ellison tells employees that FTX does not have enough funds to give all of its users their money back, and is trying to raise funds. Drappi says he is surprised because a firm would usually raise money to fund their operations, not to fill a hole in a company's balance sheet. He then asks Ellison if the loan was collateralized in a standard way. She says it was not. The final witness of the week was Zac Prince. He is also the CEO of a crypto company that went under -- not an exchange like FTX, where digital currencies like Bitcoin are traded, but a company that lent to other businesses in the industry. Prince's company, BlockFi, lent more than 1 billion to Alameda Research over a few years, and he said the company always made payments on time. He also saw Alameda's balance sheets every quarter, and based on those, he thought the company was in very good shape. He said he did not know Alameda was taking money from FTX, or about loans it made to insiders like Bankman-Fried, and would not have lent to Alameda if he would known the true state of its finances. When the crypto market fell sharply in mid-2022, BlockFi was also hit hard. It struck a deal with FTX in which borrowed from BlockFi and also had an option to buy it. It also made more loans to Alameda. Prince testified that BlockFi had 350 million on FTX in late 2022. He said that it ultimately lost 1 billion when Alameda and FTX filed for bankruptcy, and testified that it would not have happened if Alameda had been able to pay back its loans.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The labor contract between the United Auto Workers and the Detroit Three automakers expired with no new deal or even a tentative agreement in place. As warned, the UAW launched a targeted strike on Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram Trucks, immediately. These are answers to common questions about the historic 2023 strike: Why is the UAW strike called 'targeted'? In 2019, the UAW called a strike on GM and all workers at all the company sites walked off the job. That is a traditional strike. Every worker pickets together. This time, the UAW is targeting certain sites across all three Detroit automakers to achieve minimum loss of work and maximum pain on companies. So while workers at some plants are on strike, other factory workers from the same company continue to work. It is also unusual to negotiate with three automakers at once. Who pays striking UAW workers? The union pays workers 500 a week strike pay from the union strike fund supported by member dues. In exchange, the workers are required to sign up for strike duty that involves taking shifts on the picket line that often last four to six hours at a time. Some striking workers are assigned, or volunteer, to prepare food and coffee for striking workers. At no time is a strike line outside a factory or warehouse on strike without picketing. The shifts run 24 hours. Working UAW members often volunteer to walk the strike line with union brothers and sisters after their work shifts end. What are the sticking points? The UAW is working to get a contract that recovers benefits lost by retirees, boosts pay and benefits for current hourly workers, restores cost-of-living adjustment payments for inflation and creates protections for workers in the future who may be impacted by the industry transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Restoring retirement benefits lost during the Great Recession is top of mind. The topic of battery plants have been a key issue. Has there been progress on UAW talks with the automakers? Ford, GM and Stellantis have all proposed double-digit wage increases and Ford has touted what it calls the best UAW contract proposal in 80 years. There is no question the UAW has pushed the companies to improve overall packages but UAW leaders say the companies can do more to reward workers who help make the huge profits that reward stockholders. The UAW touted a battery plant agreement with GM on October 6. Which Ford, GM, Stellantis plants are on strike? Ford: Michigan Assembly in Wayne (Bronco, Ranger truck), Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville (F-Series Super Duty truck, Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator) and Chicago Assembly in Illinois (Explorer, Police Interceptor Utility, Lincoln Aviator). GM: Wentzville Assembly in Missouri (Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon trucks, Chevy Express and GMC Savana vans), Lansing Delta Township Assembly (Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse), and all 18 parts distribution centers nationally known as Customer Care and Aftersales facilities. Stellantis: Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio (Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Gladiator), and all 20 parts distribution centers nationally. How many autoworkers are on strike? An estimated 34,000 UAW autoworkers were striking as of October 12, according to the union. Workers say they are ready to return to work but they are loyal to union solidarity. Have other businesses been affected by the strike? Auto suppliers have seen work slowdowns and shutdowns, as well as businesses in the areas around factories and warehouses. Suppliers have had to lay off workers in response to the strike. And the Detroit Three have had to lay off workers because of the production disruption, a rolling number that continues to grow. For example, Ford has laid off an estimated 2,000 workers at six locations because of 16,000 striking workers at three auto plants, as of Thursday. Ford predicts 13 sites will be immediately impacted by the Kentucky Truck shutdown. GM and Stellantis are reeling, too. How big is the 2023 strike compared to the 2019 strike? So far, this UAW strike against automakers is smaller in size and scope than the UAW strike four years ago. In 2019, the UAW ran a strike campaign against GM that lasted 40 days and shut down every single facility and all its 48,000 workers left their jobs nationally. How affected are car dealerships by the strike? Some parts warehouses may be staffed by salaried workers and, in some places, strikers and reporters have witnessed nonunion temporary workers bused in but, overall, the strike is expected to impact availability of cars on the lots. Additionally, parts needed for repairs on GM, Jeep, Chrysler, Ram Trucks and Dodge vehicles are expected to be delayed or unavailable. How does the UAW strike impact the transition to EVs? The plants targeted by the strikes, all producing gasoline-powered vehicles, generate the money needed to invest in manufacturing that will build the electric vehicles. When will the 2023 UAW strike end? People close to negotiations have speculated that the UAW strike on Ford, GM and Stellantis could last longer than the 2019 strike and push into November. Meanwhile, union and company officials say they are working to get good deals as quickly as possible.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

What does it change?,"The White House announced on October 13 that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition to bolster Russia's war against Ukraine. Washington published pictures tracking a set of containers as it traveled from Najin, North Korea, to Dunay, Russia, by a Russian-flagged vessel. The supplies were then reportedly moved by rail to an ammunition depot in southwestern Russia near Tikhoretsk, roughly 200 kilometers from Ukraine's state border. We condemn (North Korea) for providing the Russians with this military equipment, YOU.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. The weapons would be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby added. While the news of an armaments delivery from North Korea to Russia was unsettling, it was not unexpected. Read also: Can Russia afford to commit to a years-long war? North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un arrived in Russia for a six-day tour of the country's far east last month, visiting an aircraft plant, inspecting the Admiral Shaposhnikov frigate, and meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Experts suggested that Moscow could furnish North Korea with the technology they needed for its struggling spy satellite program in return for Pyongyang's stockpile of Soviet-era weaponry - primarily artillery shells that could be used by Russian guns in Ukraine. The news of military cooperation confirms that we have entered a new era of Russia-North Korea relations. But it also poses a new question: What happens next for Moscow, Pyongyang, and the silent Beijing? Russia and North Korea have a longstanding relationship despite Pyongyang's zealous isolationism. In 2000, the two countries signed a treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation, and Moscow is one of just a handful of countries to maintain an embassy in Pyongyang. There have been multiple reports of North Korean hackers working from Russian territory, and North Korean laborers working in industries such as logging. But Russia and North Korea's relationship is not as simple or straightforward. Moscow has also supported numerous UN resolutions imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, including in 2010, 2013, and 2017. President Putin told reporters after Kim Jong-Un's visit that Moscow would uphold these sanctions, despite earlier remarks from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the resolutions had been made during a completely different geopolitical situation. Rather than an ongoing commitment, the latest chapter is more likely to consist of both sides exploiting global events to further their own ends. Moscow is looking not only for ammunition but also support for its aggression in Ukraine. North Korea is one of only a handful of countries to recognize Russian illegal territorial gains and consistently vote against UN resolutions supporting Ukraine. For now, the situation is still purely based on the idea that we will give you something, and we want something in exchange. There is no ideological cooperation, says Natalia Matiaszczyk, an expert at the Polish think tank Institute of New Europe. Support from North Korea is something Russia uses to legitimize its illegal actions on Ukraine territory. In many ways, this is as important as receiving the weapons themselves -- particularly as North Korea's ammunition stockpile is believed to be not only outdated but also of low quality. It is by no means certain that such ammunition could make a significant difference on the front line. But many outsiders underestimate North Korea's own agency. Pyongyang is also seizing a new diplomatic space that has opened up as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, says Yong-Chool Ha, director of the Center for Korea Studies at the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington. North Koreans have been suffering from the severe impact of the sanctions that have been imposed upon them, he says. But this is a new sort of opportunity and the evolution of a new diplomatic horizon, and we can see that in North Korea's behavior toward Russia. Read also: Kyiv, Moscow's opposing attitudes toward Soviet past shape two different futures And while the invasion of Ukraine has given North Korea new opportunities, it does not mean that it is an issue that holds a particular imperative for Pyongyang. For North Korea, Kim Jong-Un's visit to Russia was more of a signal of the country's re-opening after Covid 19 than of the country's stance in European affairs. After more than three years of closed borders due to Covid, North Korea is now opening back up slightly. North Koreans who were based abroad are now being allowed to come back, there has been news that soon, even foreigners will be allowed to visit. This is a huge change in domestic policy, says Tereza Novotna, a Korea-Europe Center Fellow at the Free University Berlin. Novotna points out that it was not just military facilities that featured in Kim Jong-Un's Russian itinerary. Kim Jong-Un also visited both an aquarium (where the North Korean leader was applauded by a walrus) and the ballet (although Russian news outlets reported he left after the first act). After the lockdown ended in Europe, we were so happy to finally go on vacation, says Novotna. Well, Kim Jong-Un's lockdown just ended now, and he went on vacation too. North Korea, however, is unlikely to provide Moscow with ammunition purely as thanks for a pleasant post-Covid trip. If Pyongyang shipped shells to Russia, what can it expect in return? Despite Putin's public remarks, it remains unclear whether the Kremlin could defy international sanctions and supply military technology to Pyongyang. In his October 13 press conference, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believed Pyongyang wanted advanced Russian technologies for the North Korean military and nuclear program. Other experts believe that other types of technological exchange could be more likely. North Korea has recently been working on a satellite program but has so far faced two failed launches, says Matiaszczyk. Maybe that is what North Korea wants from Russia, a new technology that will help successfully send these satellites into orbit, she says. Real exchange between Moscow and Pyongyang is also likely to be hampered by the reaction of officials in Beijing. China is North Korea's largest trade partner, and Pyongyang relies heavily on Beijing's economic aid. Increased cooperation with Russia could be an attempt to reduce that dependency -- but China will not want its influence in the region to be diminished by the Kremlin and could make their displeasure known. Beijing currently also hopes to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and good relations with a number of other global powers, says Matiaszczyk. Russian tech deliveries to North Korea could endanger both of these goals. In the context of the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese authorities primarily seek to prevent escalation. That is why in the past, when North Korea pursued aggressive politics and nuclear testing, China supported the UN Security Council resolution against North Korea, says Matiaszczyk. Tightening cooperation between North Korea and Russia will also force the YOU.S., Japan, and South Korea to deepen their cooperation, including militarily, and that is something China really does not want. Read also: Even after sanctions, Russian economy can pay for war Then there is the question of the UN Security Council. If Russia violates UN sanctions, then the council will be forced to meet to discuss the situation. Although Moscow would be able to veto new sanctions, the scenario would still see Beijing in a difficult position. If Chinese officials voted in favor of a resolution, it would damage ties with Moscow. Still, if it were to abstain or vote against, China's international reputation and relationship with the West could be further damaged. China would be in a very awkward position, says Matiaszczyk. That is not to say that North Korea would be unhappy to see Beijing face such an uncomfortable diplomatic conundrum. In fact, Pyongyang has always been skilled at playing international powers off each other, says Novotna. North Korea could well try to exploit such a situation to gain maximum benefit from both Moscow and Beijing. I do not think there is ever been much love lost between North Korea and China. China has always been seen as a country that North Korea is dependent on -- and that there is no way to avoid that, she says. Yet, ultimately, it remains unlikely that Russia could replace China as a partner for North Korea. I do not think North Koreans would like to alienate China at this point, frankly. I do not think Russia could be a substitute for China either, says Ha. China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea's trade -- not Russia. Some commentators have raised the prospect that closer North Korean-Russia ties could pave the way for a new geopolitical power bloc comprising of Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang. But, most regional experts believe this risk is largely overstated. Rather than having a single outlook, each of these three countries has its own goals, needs, and relationships with each other. Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang also have their own separate relationships with other Asian countries. Rather than China, Russia, and North Korea rushing to form their own three-state bloc, a looser Eurasian alignment that involves other nations, such as certain Central Asian states, could be a more likely geopolitical outcome, says Ha. He believes that Kim Jong-Un is increasingly concerned about North Korea's place in southeast Asia, particularly after the Camp David summit in August when leaders from the YOU.S., South Korea, and Japan met to discuss greater military cooperation. The North Korean leader would later describe the alliance as the Asian version of NATO, the root because of war and aggression, and claimed the start of a new Cold War. I think Kim Jong-Un's perception of the emerging regional world and what is happening surrounding the Korean Peninsula was a factor in this meeting with Putin, says Ha. With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the strategic world map also changed dramatically. The Camp David summit was a clear indication of that drastic change in the security environment not only around the Korean Peninsula, but in East Asia in general. But this wider regional picture means that European nations should also try to engage in wider dialogue on North Korean-Russian issues. NATO should maintain close cooperation with allies like South Korea and Japan both in political, economic, and also military aspects, says Matiaszczyk, and should at least try to work with China. Europe also should not dismiss the idea of engaging with North Korea itself. I would advise the West not to see North Korea through the lens of Russia or Moscow's war on Ukraine, says Novotna. Now that North Korea is re-opening, it is a good moment to kind of restart European engagement with North Korea, and to think again about how to do it better than we did before, she says. It would be good to think about how to do this without putting Pyongyang into the same basket as Russia or Beijing and thinking of them as one entity because once we start doing this, that is what is actually going to happen, Novotna adds. We still have a chance for different policies.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The White House showed a series of satellite images that it said indicate cargo from an ammunition depot in North Korea (DPRK) was loaded on to a Russian-flagged ship and then taken by rail to a depot near Russia's southwestern border. The delivery took place between September 7 and October 1, the US says. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians, and further Russia's illegitimate war, White House spokesman John Kirby said yesterday. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for a rare summit last month at which they discussed military matters, the war in Ukraine and possible Russian help for the secretive state's satellite programme. In return for support, North Korea is seeking military assistance from Russia, including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles and other advanced technologies, Kirby said. The US is closely monitoring whether Moscow will deliver the weapons, but early signs of Russian ships offloading materials in North Korea may represent initial deliveries, Kirby said. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime, Kirby said. The US says it will continue to enforce sanctions, expose the alleged arms deals, and make the case at the United Nations that the actions violate security council resolutions. We will not allow the DPRK to aid Russia's war machine in secret. And the world should know about the support that Russia may again provide the DPRK in return, Kirby said. Separately, Russian forces pummelled the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka from the ground and air yesterday, the fourth day of intense fighting in the biggest offensive by Russian forces in months. Ukraine said its forces were holding their ground but Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka's military administration, said the town was under constant attack from air, artillery and large numbers of troops. The battles have been going on for four days now. Fierce and really non-stop ... They are firing from everything they have available, Barabash said in televised comments. It was a very hot night in Avdiivka. There were several air strikes on the city itself ... the attacks do not stop day or night. The attack on Avdiivka is one of the few big assaults Russia has mounted since Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in early June to try to drive out Russian troops occupying large swathes of territory in the east and south. In the last few months, Russia has focused on holding back Ukrainian forces who have made slow progress through Russian minefields and heavily fortified trenches, and on carrying out air strikes on port and grain infrastructure. But Kyiv says Moscow has massed troops around Avdiivka and sent in heavy equipment, enabling it to hit back hard. It says Moscow aims to encircle and capture the town, just northwest of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, and draw in Ukrainian troops from other fronts. Reuters was unable to verify the battlefield reports. Avdiivka is home to a big coking plant and has become a symbol of resistance as it has prevented Russia taking full control of the Donetsk region, which Russia says it has annexed. The town has not only held out against Russia's forces since its full-scale invasion in February 2022 but has resisted capture since 2014, when Russian-backed militants seized territory in east Ukraine after Russian forces captured Crimea. The Russians threw a lot of forces in this direction. They are betting on quantity. Our army is holding positions in heavy fighting, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, wrote on the X social media platform. Avdiivka. A Ukrainian city. Our land, he wrote. l Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, visiting the Black Sea port of Odesa, vowed yesterday to improve Ukraine's air defences and to increase the security of a humanitarian corridor for grain exports. Zelenskiy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are vital to ensuring budget revenues following a surge in s defence spending following Russia's invasion last year.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesperson said the equipment will be used against innocent Ukrainians. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, said Mr Kirby, referring to North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In return for support, we assess Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. Satellite images released by Washington on Friday did not show the contents of the containers. Pyongyang and Moscow have consistently denied US reports of North Korean ammunition deliveries to Russia dating back to last year. Speculation that a deal was being brokered for Pyongyang to replenish Russian stocks was reignited in early September when Kim Jong Un, North Korea's leader, travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin, visiting key military sites. The details of their talks over a lavish lunch were not publicised, but US intelligence officials suggested at the time that Moscow would likely seek artillery shells and anti-tank missiles from North Korea, possibly in exchange for advanced satellite and nuclear-powered submarine technology. The latest images released by the White House were said to show the containers loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The US said the containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, a seaport near Vladivostok in Russia. Nuclear threat It unveiled the new intelligence as North Korea threatened again to use nuclear weapons to defend itself after the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and its battle group in the southern South Korean port of Busan. Last week the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), also published satellite photos that it said showed a dramatic and unprecedented increase in freight railcar traffic along North Korea's border with Russia. The CSIS report said that the contents of the covered containers at the rail station were probable weapons shipments. However, an analysis by the Seoul-based NK Pro website concluded that on-the-ground photos from the border indicated the tarp-covered goods were for disinfection, meaning it was more likely that the goods were imports from Russia to North Korea, which is only just reopening after the pandemic.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The Crimean Bridge was built partly due to the use of Dutch knowledge and expertise, the office said in its statement. The guilty parties were not publicly named, as the cases were settled out of court. One company was made to forfeit 71,330 (75,210) in revenues supposedly earned from the project, and the four companies together paid a total of 160,000 (169,000) in fines for the sanctions violations. The individuals were sentenced to between 20 and 60 hours of community service each. Another three companies are said to still be under investigation regarding their participation in the project, which began construction in 2015, opening to vehicular traffic in 2018 and rail in 2019. Spanning the Kerch Strait with a length of 19km (12 miles), the Crimean Bridge is the longest in Europe. It quickly exceeded the popularity of the ferry, which was formerly the only direct means of transport between mainland Russia and Crimea and has become an economic lifeline for the region after the US-backed coup of 2014 installed a new regime in Kiev. The US and EU have both imposed sanctions on dozens of companies and individuals involved in the construction of the Crimean Bridge, expanding the sanctions they initially deployed against Moscow over Crimea's 2014 referendum in favor of becoming part of Russia - a move the West and the government in Kiev refer to as an illegal annexation. Since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in 2022, Kiev has openly sought to destroy the bridge, which both countries view as a critically important strategic link and a symbol of Moscow's permanence in Crimea. Ukraine has taken credit for multiple attacks on the structure, even releasing a commemorative postage stamp likening it to the doomed ocean liner Titanic.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

He and his neighbors cut the avocados with the owners permission and sell them to motorists at a nearby toll booth or on the streets of the nearby city of Valencia, which has not emptied out as much as San Joaquin from migration over the last decade. They live day by day. Their pension these days amounts to 3.70 a month, only 20 cents more than the cost of a gallon of bottled water. So no sales mean no food. Sometimes, we even have to barter avocados for food in other neighborhoods. We want jobs! Hernandez, 67, exclaimed while sitting on his dusty, cement-floor porch with a neighbor. He was a carrier, I sold merchandise downtown. Right now, there is no work. All the young people have already left. This neighborhood is desolate! The political, social and economic crisis that has come to define their South American homeland has evolved since it began a decade ago as a result of a global drop in the price of oil, Venezuela's most valuable resource, mismanagement by the self-proclaimed socialist administration and government repression of its opponents. The latest phase has been particularly challenging after the economic stability that many experienced for several months overlapping 2021 and 2022 vanished. They again are grappling with constant food-price hikes, business closures and painful thoughts of migrating. FILE - People shop at a street market in the Petare neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela, October 4, 2023. (AP PhotoMatias Delacroix, File) Amid this daily reality, Venezuelans are hearing election chatter as the opposition gets ready to hold a primary October 22 to pick a candidate to challenge President Nicols Maduro in a presidential election next year. But apathy and disgust toward politics and politicians - be they Maduro, his allies or his adversaries - have deepened among the young and old amid the litany of disappointments, corruption accusations, rampant misinformation and government repression. Maduros government managed to get Venezuela out of a hyperinflationary cycle at the end of 2021 with public spending cuts, tax increases and foreign currency injections. For a time last year, workers could pull out of their pockets a dollar or two and maybe even some worthless bolivares, the local currency. Practically everyone knew someone running a business from their home, such as selling sugar-free snacks via Instagram or offering group lessons on basic math. The respite - coming after Venezuela's economy contracted 80 from 2014 into 2021 - even prompted some Venezuelans to return from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and other Latin American countries that had hosted them for years but where they could not find work in a post-pandemic economy. It also slowed down the exodus from Venezuela. But by January, the stability was gone. May 1 came and went without the presidents traditional Labor Day announcement of a minimum wage increase. The last raise, in April 2022, put monthly pay at 130 bolivares, which at the time was worth 30, but has now dwindled to 3.70. These days, a kilo (2.2 pounds) of chicken costs about 2.40, a dozen eggs is 2.25, and a liter (a little over a quart) of milk goes for 2. Things got very difficult. Even getting sick is difficult because if you buy food, you cant buy medicine, Mayela Ramirez, 59, said standing by her front door in downtown Valencia, once home to multiple auto assembly plants. I have a nephew who has a problem with his brain - he has like a ball growing there - and needs a biopsy, but he cant (afford it) because it is 150, so we are doing raffles to raise money. Ramirez helps her husband run his auto repair shop, but it is no longer uncommon for a week to go by without a single car being dropped off. It has been a long time since she shopped freely at the grocery store, where she now buys more vegetables than ever because protein sources are too expensive. She has noticed people have begun leaving the country again, including four of her neighbors who migrated at the end of September. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled their country, mostly to Latin American and Caribbean countries. But these days, people are migrating with their eyes set on the YOU.S. and not Colombia or Peru, which have received the largest number of Venezuelans since the crisis began. Over the last year, the number of Venezuelan migrants trying to enter the YOU.S. through its southern border has increased exponentially. YOU.S. border patrol agents in the last 11 months had more than 199,500 encounters with Venezuelans at the YOU.S.-Mexico border, compared with 2,700 in all 2020. In August alone, the encounters were more than 31,400. Venezuelans have come to feel the crisis as one numbingly featureless expanse of struggles, though they use some of its bigger calamities to parse out one year from another: 2017 had mass anti-Maduro protests and repression; 2018 saw severe food shortages; 2019 brought nationwide power outages; 2020 had days-long gas station lines. Worries are growing as people see many of these woes striking all at once, even in the capital, Caracas, whose residents had been partially insulated from some of the crisis challenges. The variety of products at supermarket shelves and neighborhood markets is getting smaller. Imported-goods stores put goods on the front edge of shelves to give the appearance of being fully stocked. Restaurants are closing. Refilling a gas tank with subsidized fuel again involves careful planning. Hours-long power outages are more frequent in Caracas. Many long for the days of el Comandante - the late President Hugo Chvez and his self-described socialist revolution of the 2000s. But regardless of political affiliation, Venezuelans are increasingly feeling like pawns in a geopolitical game that ignores their empty wallets. A 12-hour stretch one recent day illustrated that growing sentiment. Around 9:30 a.m., the highway that goes by San Joaquin was blocked by soldiers purportedly for unsafe conditions due to downed electrical wires, but they moved aside roughly two hours later after local leaders verified that Maria Corina Machado, the frontrunner in the oppositions presidential primary, had left the area. By 4:30 p.m., the YOU.S. government, whose economic sanctions failed to topple Maduro, flipped-flopped on its definition of safety for Venezuelans when it announced the resumption of deportation flights to the South American country. The announcement came just two weeks after it had expanded protections for about 500,000 Venezuelan migrants citing increased instability and lack of safety in the country. Around 6 p.m., news of the flights spread on social media and thousands of people rallied with Machado in Valencia. An hour later, the attorney general announced on national television a new criminal investigation against Juan Guaid, an exiled opposition leader who ran a parallel government to Maduros with the help of the YOU.S. The government needs to be removed, but right now, right now, what is affecting us Venezuelans is the economy, said Vanessa Martinez, 31, who does maintenance at a rest stop for about 60 a month and was unaware of the oppositions primary.

Entries include material from wire services and other sources. 2:30 p.m. Visiting European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Saturday he has urged China not to support Russia in its war against Ukraine by providing weapons or helping Moscow circumvent Western sanctions. Borrell, who is on a three-day China visit, also told a press conference he has asked Beijing to use its influence to make Russia go back to a grain deal initiative to allow the resumption of Ukraine grain exports via the Black Sea. Otherwise, we will face another food crisis, he said, noting the war has sent shock waves around the world. Moscow has pulled out of the grain deal mediated by Turkey and the United Nations. 11:30 a.m. Russian forces pounded the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka for the fourth day in a row on Friday. In Avdiivka, known for its large coking plant in Ukraine's Donbas industrial heartland, officials said the Russian assaults had left the already-gutted city in flames. The fighting has been going on for four consecutive days, Vitaliy Barabash, head of the city's military administration, told Ukrainian national television. They have substantial reserves of personnel and equipment. Avdiivka is completely ablaze. They shoot, using everything they have. The hospital is again under fire, as are administrative buildings and our volunteer center. 12:30 a.m. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine, Prime Minister Mark Rutte says, according to Reuters. This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric air strikes, Rutte says following a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Odessa, Ukraine. Rutte says the Netherlands would also help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to help keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Friday, October 13 11:10 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says on the key topic of his upcoming visit to China would be the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing's plan for global infrastructure and energy networks it launched a decade ago. Putin said he would also discuss settlements in national currencies with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing next week. Thursday, October 12 10:48 p.m. The International Olympic Committee's executive board says it has suspended the Russian Olympic Committee with immediate effect for including regional sports organizations in Ukraine as ROC members, since this violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine's National Olympic Committee. The ROC had recognized Olympic Councils from the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia -- parts of Ukraine that Russia has unilaterally declared as part of itself. The ROC is no longer entitled to operate as a National Olympic Committee ... and cannot receive any funding from the Olympic Movement, said the IOC, which reserves the right to decide about the participation of individual neutral athletes with a Russian passport in the Olympic Games Paris 2024 and the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 at the appropriate time. Russia remains excluded from international events in team sports, The Associated Press reports. 5:30 p.m. The Czech Republic and Denmark will jointly supply heavy military equipment to Ukraine in the coming months, the Czech Defense Ministry says. The Czech-made supplies, financed from the Danish budget, would include tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, handguns and ammunition. 4:28 p.m. The Russian ruble leaped more than 3 on Thursday to a more than two-week high past 96 to the dollar after President Vladimir Putin ordered the mandatory sale of foreign currency revenues for some exporters to buttress the Russian currency. The ruble collapsed to a record low in the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, after which authorities imposed similar capital controls that saw the rouble recover to a seven-year high. But it has charted a steadily downward course this year, under pressure from capital outflows, falling exports and recovering imports. 3:48 p.m. Russia and India are in discussions about a summit between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year, India's ambassador to Moscow was quoted by Russian news agency RIA as saying. It is being discussed. There are high-level discussions going on, Ambassador Pavan Kapoor said. 1:25 a.m. The YOU.S. says it will send up to 200 million in military supplies to Ukraine in its latest package of support. The package includes additional air defense capabilities, anti-tank weapons, additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other equipment, according to a statement from the Pentagon. 12:02 a.m. Ukraine received a 1.15 billion grant from the YOU.S. as part of the PEACE in Ukraine program, reports Reuters, citing the Ukrainian Finance Ministry. The PEACE (Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance) in Ukraine project has been the World Bank's flagship financing instrument for Kyiv during the war. Wednesday, October 11 11:55 p.m. Denmark, the Netherlands and the YOU.S. will spearhead a new international coalition to help Ukraine establish a future air force based on F-16 fighter jets, the Danish Defense Ministry said, according to Reuters. The new coalition intends to build infrastructure around F-16s, including maintenance facilities to support the operation of the planes, the ministry said in a statement. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first two countries to commit to donating F-16 jets to Ukraine, which currently has an air force fleet of aging Soviet-era fighter jets. 6:00 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked NATO allies on Wednesday for more weapons and air defense systems to tide his country over another wartime winter as it braces for a further barrage of Russian attacks on power stations and infrastructure. Zelenskyy was making his first visit to NATO headquarters since Russia's invasion last year, at a time when turbulence in the YOU.S. Congress threatens to disrupt aid for Kyiv and world attention is being drawn to the crisis unfolding in Israel. 2:30 p.m. China will host its third Belt and Road Forum next week, its foreign ministry says, a signature event for President Xi Jinping that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is due to attend on a rare trip abroad. The Beijing conference on October 17-18 marks the 10th anniversary of the Xi-championed Belt and Road Initiative. Representatives from many developing countries, notably from Latin America and Africa, are expected to attend. Putin attended the two previous forums, in 2017 and 2019, and the Kremlin said in September he had accepted an invitation to next week's gathering and for talks with Xi. 7:30 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the recent violence between Israel and the Palestinians showed that YOU.S. policy had failed in the Middle East and had ignored the needs of Palestinians. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin was in touch with both sides and would seek a role in resolving the conflict. Peskov warned that the conflict risked spilling over into other regions. During talks with visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, Putin blamed the escalation on years of YOU.S. policy. I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East, he said. 1:13 a.m. Germany announces new support for Ukraine, with a roughly 1 billion euro (1.06 billion) air defense package and a more than 20 million euro package of vehicles, weapons and personal equipment. The air defense package includes the Patriot and IRIS-T systems. Germany is thus further increasing the operational readiness of the Ukrainian armed forces in the coming months, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius says. 1:00 a.m. Russia fails in its bid to return to the United Nations' top human rights body. In a secret ballot, Russia won 83 votes versus 160 for Bulgaria and 123 for Albania, which had competed against it in the same eastern Europe grouping for two seats on the Geneva-based Human Rights Council for a three-year term beginning on January 1. Tuesday, October 10 11:01 p.m. A subsea gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia under the Baltic Sea have been damaged in what may have been a deliberate act, the Finnish government says, according to Reuters. The Balticconnector gas pipeline was shut early on Sunday on concerns that gas was leaking from a hole in the 77-kilometer pipeline. Finnish operator Gasgrid said it could take months or more to repair. 10:07 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he had good news on artillery and air defense supplies after talks with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in Bucharest, but gave no details, reports Reuters. My main accent today was air defense. And I am glad that Ukraine was heard by the Romanian side, Zelenskyy, who has been seeking more arms to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion, tells a joint press conference in the Romanian capital. 3:20 p.m. Russia launched 36 Iranian-made attack drones against southern Ukraine overnight, damaging infrastructure in the Odesa region, authorities say. The strikes targeted the Odesa, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian military reported, adding that air defense systems destroyed 27 drones. Odesa's governor, Oleh Kiper, said unspecified logistics infrastructure had been struck but that no injuries were reported. 10:00 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to hold talks in the Kremlin on Tuesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani on bilateral issues and the developing situation in the Middle East. Issues of developing multifaceted Russian-Iraqi cooperation, as well as current topics on the international agenda, primarily the situation in the Middle East, will be discussed in detail, the Kremlin said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. 7:00 a.m. Top United Nations trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russian officials in Moscow on Monday for talks aimed at enabling unimpeded access to global markets for grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine, a YOU.N. spokesperson said. YOU.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths attended the meetings virtually, YOU.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues in his determination to facilitate the unimpeded access to global markets for food products and fertilizers from both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, Dujarric added. 2:10 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says on Monday that it was in Russia's interests to stoke war in the Middle East to weaken global unity. Based on available information -- very clear information -- it is in Russia's interests to inflame war in the Middle East to create a new source of pain and suffering that would weaken global unity, create divisions and help Russia in undermining freedom in Europe, Zelenskyy says in his nightly video address. Zelenskyy says Russians propagandists were gloating at developments and that Iran, which he described as Moscow's ally, was openly supporting those attacking Israel. In a call on Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Zelenskyy says Ukraine was in solidarity with Israel, which is enduring a brazen, large-scale attack. Sunday, October 8 5:35 a.m. Russia's Defence Ministry says the country's air defense systems detected and destroyed two Ukrainian S-200 anti-aircraft missiles, thwarting attacks it says Kyiv attempted four hours apart on the Crimean Peninsula. 4:00 a.m. Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia's Chechnya region and close ally of President Vladimir Putin, says a presidential election due next March should either be postponed due to the war in Ukraine or limited to one candidate, Putin. The Kremlin leader has said he will not announce if he will run before parliament calls the election, which by law it is due to do in December. I propose now, while the 'special military operation' is under way, to unanimously decide that we will have one candidate in the elections -- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, Kadyrov was quoted as saying by the state-run RIA news agency at a rally in the Chechen capital Grozny to mark Putin's October 7 birthday that was attended by thousands. 3:15 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin announces the start of gas supplies to Uzbekistan via Kazakhstan in a meeting with his counterparts from the two countries in Moscow. This is the largest trilateral energy project among the three ex-Soviet countries, Putin said, after formally launching the shipment. Under a two-year deal signed with Russia's Gazprom, Uzbekistan will import 9 million cubic meters of Russian natural gas per day. 12:15 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemns what he called a terrorist attack on Israel after a surprise assault by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and backed the country's right to self-defense. Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world, he wrote on the social media platform X. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment. Saturday, October 7 9:30 p.m. Rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border rose sharply this week to the highest in years, suggesting arms supply by Pyongyang to Moscow after their leaders discussed deeper military cooperation, a YOU.S. think tank says. Satellite imagery showed an unprecedented 73 or so freight cars at Tumangang Rail Station in the North Korean border city of Rason, the Beyond Parallel Project of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report. The traffic was far greater than that observed in the past five years, including pre-pandemic levels, it says. 6:00 a.m. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's envoy to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, says Moscow will revoke its ratification of the pact, a move that Washington denounced as endangering the global norm against nuclear test blasts. Ulyanov said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Russia plans to revoke ratification (which took place in 2000) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The aim is to be on equal footing with the US who signed the Treaty, but did not ratify it. Revocation does not mean the intention to resume nuclear tests. 1:30 a.m. The YOU.S. Commerce Department has added 42 Chinese companies to a government export control list over support for Moscow's military and defense industrial base, including supplying the Russian sector YOU.S.-origin integrated circuits. Another seven entities from Finland, Germany, India, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom were also added to the trade export control list. The circuits include microelectronics that Russia uses for precision guidance systems in missiles and drones launched against civilian targets in Ukraine, the Commerce Department said in a statement. Today's additions to the Entity List provide a clear message: if you supply the Russian defense sector with YOU.S.-origin technology, we will find out, and we will take action, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said in the statement.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a YOU.S. plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments had been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken and Kuleba discussed the latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department. What is NABUR? Join the online forum",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A day after murderous terrorists invaded Israel, critical infrastructure connecting frontline NATO allies was shut down as a result of external activity -- possibly foreign sabotage -- according to Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. Russia sympathizes with us, senior Hamas official Ali Baraka said in a Sunday interview on the government-controlled Russia Today TV. One war eases the pressure in another war. While Finnish and Estonian officials are still investigating the disruption of a pipeline and communication cable, the timing is likely no coincidence. If it resulted from foreign action, then the foreign agents took advantage of the fact that world attention was focused elsewhere to carry out an operation they had likely already planned. Did Russia have prior knowledge of Hamas's invasion plan? Russia has long weaponized its monopolistic position as Europe's oil supplier to extract political concessions from dependent neighbors by cutting off energy supplies. The Balticonnector Pipeline began operations in 2020, connecting Finland to the rest of Europe via Estonia and reducing Russia's oil leverage over both countries. Russia would clearly benefit from disabling the pipeline. Both countries are pro-western states on Russia's border and view the USSR's primary successor state as their greatest threat. In April, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Finland officially joined the anti-Russian NATO alliance, which Estonia joined in 2004. Yet, according to Baraka's interview in a Russian propaganda outlet, Russia was notified prior to the assault. In order to keep the attack secret and successful, the different factions and our allies did not know the zero hour, he said. But Hamas did update Russia after they inquired about the Hamas attack and its intention. If Russia is responsible for the Balticonnector sabotage, they implemented the plan opportunistically. Russia was not the only ally Hamas informed of its plans on Saturday. After half an hour of commencing the attack, all the Palestinian resistance factions were contacted, as were our allies in Hezbollah and Iran, said Baraka. He added that they even notified Turkey -- an increasingly rogue member of NATO -- and met with them only three hours into the operation. Our allies are those that support us with weapons and money, explained Baraka. First and foremost, it is Iran that is giving us money and weapons. For years, Western intelligence officials have known that Iran was providing military training and logistical help. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said last year that Iran had provided the group with 70 million in military assistance. On Thursday, the YOU.S. government and Qatar agreed to block Iran from accessing 6 billion in funds the YOU.S. had unfrozen as an appeasement measure. Baraka also pointed to Hamas's close affinity with Hezbollah, another radical Islamic terror organization funded by Iran, but which is based in Lebanon instead of Gaza. Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel on Tuesday, in an effort to divide Israel's forces and limit the safe places where refugees from southern Israel could be temporarily relocated. Baraka also boasted that the Arab and Islamic people ... are standing by us. Even if he presumes too much when speaking for all people who identify as Muslims, these are not idle words; on Sunday, Palestinian sympathizers staged demonstrations in support of Hamas' barbarous tactics across the West. Even Russia sympathizes with us, added Baraka. Russia is happy that America is getting embroiled in Palestine. It alleviates the pressure on the Russians in Ukraine. One war eases the pressure in another war. So, we are not alone on the battlefield. He said that Russia, a major exporter of weapons, even gave a Russian license to produce Kalashnikov bullets in Gaza, allowing Hamas to procure additional ammunition for Russian-made machine guns despite international sanctions. That is quite the international coalition supporting a terror group, but it features the usual suspects. Nations like Iran and Russia are not friendly toward the YOU.S. and would jump at any opportunity to knock the YOU.S. down a peg. Consequently, Hamas' attack did not happen in isolation. We have been preparing for this for two years, Baraka said. In other words, Hamas began preparing to launch a major assault against Israel in the immediate aftermath of America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some unconfirmed reports have even suggested that Hamas used weapons YOU.S. forces left behind in Afghanistan, which evidently made their way across the Middle East through illicit arms trading. When America's foes see us as weak, they calculate that it is time to strike. The same actors -- and even more of them -- are aligned on Russia's side of the conflict in Ukraine. After Ukraine stalled Russia's first assault and ground down its war machine with Western aid, Russia turned to other bad actors to restock its supplies. There have been reports that Iran, China, Cuba, North Korea, and even South Africa are supplying Moscow with military equipment and personnel. In October 2022, the Pentagon said they knew that Russia was using Iranian drones in Ukraine, and they believed Iranians were on-site to help the Russians operate them. In February, the Biden administration considered releasing intelligence that showed China was supplying arms to Russia. Customs records obtained by Politico this summer show that China has shipped body armor and other military munitions to Russia. In May, the YOU.S. ambassador to South Africa accused the allegedly neutral country with supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, via a sanctioned cargo ship it allowed to dock at a naval base near Cape Town in December. In September, the White House said North Korea and Russia were actively advancing arms negotiations, and satellite photos last week detected a near-quadrupling in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border. Even distant Cuba has gotten involved, smuggling hundreds of soldiers to fight in Russia's war. In addition to military assistance, American rivals on the world stage also cooperate economically. An organization of second-tier economic powers, known as BRICS (for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will more than double its membership in January 2024 when it officially admits Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the YOU.A.E. The organization, which includes some of the largest economies in Africa, Asia, and South America, is actively discussing ways to move international trade away from the YOU.S. dollar and towards other national currencies. BRICS expansion is significant because it indicates that even YOU.S. military allies, like India, or economic partners, like Saudi Arabia, are increasingly willing to cooperate with adversaries the YOU.S. has tried to isolate. Such interconnection in foreign policy is not a new development. Independent powers have combined into military coalitions since at least the time of Abraham (see Genesis 14:1-2). In the century between Napoleon and World War I (1814-1919), international politics particularly focused on the alliances between five to nine so-called great powers, which were ever-changing to maintain a precarious balance of power. This provoked a string of conflicts, culminating in two devastating world wars. After World War II, only two great powers remained (the YOU.S. and the Soviet Union), which spearheaded two worldwide coalitions (countries not aligned with either side were dubbed the third world). Due to the invention of nuclear weapons, the two great powers did not risk an all-out war, but they still struggled together in an economic Cold War and a series of proxy wars over influence in other countries -- Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua, Afghanistan. When the Soviet Union collapsed after four decades, the YOU.S. found itself in the rare position of a global hegemon -- a world power with no equal. The conflicts of this period -- two Iraq wars, Afghanistan, Serbia -- reflect America's ability to go anywhere in the world and do whatever we wanted, always dealing with asymmetric opponents. In the early 2000s, President Bush could call out by name an axis of evil, consisting of three countries, for the whole world to shun. But shifting alliances and changing power balances have changed the global situation once again. China's decades-long buildup and Russia's resurgence have placed the YOU.S. on the defensive in far-flung zones of influence. Part of this is from not recognizing the threat. America has largely let China's military buildup and global friend-buying projects go unanswered, and the YOU.S. has become consumed with internal divisions, which other nations may have played a role in aggravating. We stopped playing the game, while everyone else was playing harder than ever. Whatever the reason why a growing coalition of global adversaries is arrayed against America, a world in which the YOU.S. is not the all-dominant power is actually just a return to equilibrium, from a historical aberration. Most Americans today cannot remember anything different, but for most of history geopolitics has been a delicate balancing act, or very bloody. American ingenuity and freedoms can go a long way, at least with good leadership. But we cannot count on always being the unchallenged champion in an adversarial arena that incentivizes the rise of challengers -- especially when those challengers can combine together. The takeaway is that America cannot afford to view one hostile power or one national crisis in isolation. What is currently happening in Israel will affect the war in Ukraine, the security of Taiwan, and even the possibility of major terror strikes against American targets.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The center, which operates as an information outlet under the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in a Telegram post that supporters of Kyiv in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol sabotaged a Russian train that is used to bring daily supplies from Crimea to Melitopol and Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The result of the attack was an explosion that reportedly damaged a locomotive and 150 meters of railway. The incident is the latest in a series of attacks this year that have targeted Russian railways. Other high-profile rail sabotage acts include an explosion on a railway line in Crimea's Feodosia region in June and a May explosion that led to a derailment suspended rail traffic between Simferopol, Crimea's capital, and Sevastopol. According to the National Resistance Center of Ukraine, Friday's incident was the 10th successful sabotage on Russian railways carried out by partisans in the Zaporizhzhia region this year. Newsweek reached out to the National Resistance Center of Ukraine and the Russian Ministry of Defense via email for comment on Friday. The Ukrainian center said the train targeted on Friday not only brings supplies to Russian President Vladimir Putin's military personnel in Zaporizhzhia, but it also carries damaged equipment and stolen goods -- such as iron ore, grain and other property -- from Ukraine back to Crimea. The center's Telegram message said Russian troops surrounded the site of the attack after the explosion in an effort to conceal the sabotage took place while also searching for the guerrillas behind the attack. The National Resistance Center of Ukraine indicated the partisans behind the attack are safe and that they have promised to carry out more acts of sabotage in the future. Ukrainian partisans have been credited with key attacks throughout the war that Putin launched in February 2022. In August 2022, The Washington Post reported partisans were likely behind an attack on Russia's Saky air base in Crimea that triggered at least 12 explosions at the facility. Supporters of Ukraine within Russia also claimed responsibility for a wave of attacks in Russia's border regions, including several in Belgorod. In late-July, partisans were also said to be behind a mass poisoning during a Russian military celebration in the occupied city of Mariupol. According to a Ukrainian official, two Russian officers were killed and 15 other troops were hospitalized after partisans poisoned Kremlin forces as they celebrated Navy Day, a popular national holiday in Russia that honors members of the nation's naval forces.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

President Joe Biden has been vocal about Israel's right to defend itself following a Hamas massacre that killed more than 1,300 civilians and soldiers in Israel. His remarks show he is prepared to give Israel a measure of latitude as the country's military pummels Hamas from land, air and sea. This was act of pure evil, Biden said Tuesday in a speech in which he outlined Hamas' atrocities. Yet in that same speech, Biden dropped in a brief, but telling, message about the need to avoid indiscriminate killing as the war moves into a coastal territory that is home to some 2 million people with no escape route. Biden said that in an earlier phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they discussed how strong democracies like Israel and the YOU.S. do not needlessly target civilians. Terrorists purposefully target civilians, kill them, he said. We uphold the laws of war -- the law of war. It matters. There is a difference. What he did not say in his speech, but NBC News later confirmed, is that Biden also urged the Israeli leader to take pains to minimize Palestinian casualties. Now, Biden administration officials are amplifying that cautionary note in their own private talks with Israeli counterparts, present and past YOU.S. officials said. In meetings in Israel on Friday, YOU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conveyed to both Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that it is important to observe international rules of warfare, two current YOU.S. officials familiar with Austin's message said. Austin advised that Israel operate on a higher moral plane than Hamas and be careful to avoid civilian casualties, they added. Austin conveyed to the Israelis that if they storm into Gaza and civilian casualties spike, the world's focus could shift from Hamas' abuses to the deaths resulting from the Israeli incursion, a current and former official said. We are trying to convince them the Israelis, but emotions are running high, the former official said. Still, the former official added that the Israelis have been listening to a certain extent, giving Palestinian civilians in Gaza advance warning to leave the north. The Biden administration is still workshopping precisely how to discuss a deadly Middle East conflict that caught the world unaware. A state department email Friday advised a small group of officials involved in public messaging to avoid using phrases like de-escalationceasefire, end to violencebloodshed and restoring calm, according to a YOU.S. official directly familiar with the email. That directive seems aimed at aligning the Biden administration with Israel's goal of vanquishing Hamas. Israelis have likened Hamas' surprise assault to the 911 terrorist attack in the YOU.S., spreading fear and outrage through the country. Israeli leaders are promising a devastating counterattack that crushes Hamas for good. Yet in doing so, they risk killing Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire and thereby squandering international sympathy and good will. If Israel expands the battlefield to other countries, they could overreach, much as then-President George W. Bush did in retaliation for the 911 attack. After rooting the Taliban in Afghanistan, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq in 2003 that resulted in a prolonged and deadly quagmire. Ben Rhodes was a national security official in President Barack Obama's administration and is close to Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser. On Friday, he wrote a post on the social media site X: The decisions being made now are going to impact millions of lives, reverberate for generations, and risk all kinds of escalation. The YOU.S. should have learned from 911 the profound cost of being guided by anger and fear. I hope that is what we are telling the Israeli government. It seems Biden is doing just that. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also visited Israel this week, said at a news conference in Qatar on Friday: We continue to discuss with Israel the importance of taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. We recognize that many Palestinian families in Gaza are suffering through no fault of their own and that Palestinian civilians have lost their lives. As a close ally that supplies Israel with billions in weapons and aid, the YOU.S. holds some leverage over how the country carries out its military operations. In the six days since Hamas attacked, the YOU.S. has sent a carrier strike group closer to Israel in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and provided the Israeli military with additional equipment and resources, including munitions, according to a statement from Austin. In addition, the YOU.S. is planning to replenish missile interceptors for Israel's Iron Dome. Over the years, past presidents have on occasion urged Israel to hold back in skirmishes with Hamas lest civilian deaths reach unacceptable levels. In 2014, for example, the Obama administration prevailed on Israel to de-escalate a conflict over rocket attacks coming from Gaza. Biden may need to have a similar conversation with Netanyahu as the war unfolds, Middle East experts said. Rest assured, there will come a time when the administration -- in response to an exponential rise in Palestinian casualties, and perhaps an Israel operation that appeared bogged down -- when the Biden administration will intercede, said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former Middle East analyst at the State Department. Biden, he added, may need to have a blunt come to Moses, Muhammad and Jesus conversation with the prime minister, getting him to show restraint.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Trump said Wednesday that Israel planned to be part of the January 2020 operation that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani but abruptly backed out the night before it was to take place. In his remarks, delivered before an audience at his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, Trump sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for that decision after months of working with the YOU.S. on the operation. But the YOU.S. officials familiar with the planning said Trump's comments are entirely false. They were never on board with it, said a former senior White House official, referring to the Israelis. They always thought it was a dangerous and destabilizing idea. One former Trump administration official familiar with the planning said that in Washington, when Trump made the decision to go ahead with the Soleimani strike, the generals who were present seemed to collectively take a deep breath. The CIA declined to comment. The Trump campaign, the YOU.S. military's Central Command and the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to requests for comment. If the former president's comments were accurate, it would have been a significant -- and classified -- revelation. Israel was going to do this with us, and it was being planned and working on it for months, Trump said Wednesday. We had everything all set to go, and the night before it happened, I got a call that Israel will not be participating in this attack. I will never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down, Trump added, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. That was a very terrible thing, he said. And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That did not make me feel too good. Israeli intelligence helped confirm Soleimani's location for American intelligence officials, NBC News first reported at the time. The YOU.S. subsequently killed Soleimani with a drone strike in Baghdad. Israel was never part of the operation, the YOU.S. officials involved in the planning said. Trump is facing federal charges over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. Trump's comments on Wednesday were part of a series of sharply critical remarks about Netanyahu in the days after Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel. On Wednesday, Trump also called Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant a jerk.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Reuters-Yonhap The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a YOU.S. plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. This image released by the US Government on October 13, reportedly shows the transfer of military equipment from North Korea to Russia. AFP-Yonhap Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years.

Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il-sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong-un , as the country's first ruler.

Please try again later verifyErrors  A Philadelphia police officer was shot and killed and a second officer was wounded when they confronted people breaking into a car at Philadelphia International Airport, police said. Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said veteran officers Richard Mendez and Raul Ortiz had just arrived at work around 11 p.m. Thursday when they heard breaking glass and saw several people breaking into a vehicle in the parking garage area. A confrontation ensued, and Mendez was shot multiple times. Ortiz was shot once in his arm, Stanford said, and one of the suspects was also wounded. Both officers were taken to hospitals, but Mendez was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later, Stanford said. Ortiz remained hospitalized Friday in stable condition. Both were assigned to the airport unit. The suspects fled the scene in an SUV that authorities later learned had been reported stolen in the city about a week ago. The vehicle was later seen at a hospital in Philadelphia dropping off 18-year-old Jesus Herman Madera Duran, who authorities say was believed to be involved in the confrontation with the officers. Duran was shot in the chest, abdomen and left arm and was pronounced dead around 11:30 p.m. Thursday. It was not clear if any other suspects were wounded in the shooting, authorities said, or how many of them had fired weapons. The shooting took place in the garage for the airport's Terminal D, which was temporarily closed during the initial investigation but later reopened. Stanford noted that the shooting came only a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this, he said. Mendez, 50, was a 22-year veteran of the force and was married with one daughter. His gun has not been located, Stanford said, and it is not yet known if anyone fired the weapon during the confrontation. Ortiz, 60, is a 20-year veteran of the department. He is married with three children. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said law enforcement staff across multiple agencies were working to identify those responsible but said they lacked the ability to match crime scene ballistics to firearms through a database of gun sales, citing a lack of gun regulation. Pennsylvania state law prevents law enforcement and government agencies from having firearm registries. Joseph Regan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge, mourned the officer's death and said members were praying for the wounded officer. We lost a hero, Regan said. A reward of 148,500 was being offered for information leading to an arrest. Two local police unions -- Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 and Lodge 27 in Delaware County -- initially provided a combined 30,000 to fund the reward. They soon received donations from numerous police groups, businesses and residents in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The reward would be in addition to a 20,000 reward that the city has offered for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Speaking Friday at a news conference to announce the police unions' reward, Lodge 5 President John McNesby said the city's police force was undermanned and said more officers were needed in the streets. He also was critical of the district attorney's office, saying that if violent offenders are not prosecuted that sends a message they can do what they want. Calling the two officers standouts and noting their long service to the city, McNesby said the loss was a tough one for their colleagues and the department. I saw more tears last night than I have ever seen in all my years here, McNesby said. President Joe Biden, who was in Philadelphia on Friday, offered his condolences the families of the officers. They put their lives on the line to protect this community, he said.  Bruce Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A trap. Poison. For decades, a grizzly bear's encounter with a humanity's footprint often meant death as settlers spread across North America. Grizzly range across the continent sits at less than half what it once used to be. And while conservation efforts have helped buoy some grizzly populations over the last several decades, some places remain more deadly than others. Over the last seven years, young grizzlies in British Columbia's Elk Valley have faced the lowest survival rate recorded in North America, according to a new study published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice. Lead author Clayton Lamb, a wildlife scientist with Biodiversity Pathways and researcher at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, said roughly half of the young male grizzlies in the area were dying every year -- a combination of human conflict and collisions with a train, truck or car. These bears are dying at extraordinary high rates, said Lamb. For any one year it is like a coin flip if you are going to live. Elk Valley grizzlies were involved in a third of all road collisions in the province despite only making up 0.6 per cent of the province's grizzly population. And when it comes to rail collisions, nearly half the recorded mortalities occur in the Elk Valley, the study found. As a result, the researchers estimated government mortality databases are underreporting grizzly deaths by 65 per cent -- meaning that for every dead grizzly, two go uncounted. A ripple effect The high death rate for young grizzlies has meant habitat in the Elk Valley is regularly opened up for more young bears to move in. Grizzlies from as far away as Banff National Park in Canada and Glacier National Park in the YOU.S. find a valley rich in both food and humans. Known for massive coal mines, the Elk Valley is laced with busy highways and rail connections that weave through towns as they link Canadian provinces east of the Rockies with ports on the coast. It is here where Lamb and his team of biologists -- one from the provincial government, others from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature based in Kaslo, B.C. -- set out to understand why grizzlies were dying at such high rates and what was keeping the their population afloat. To find out, the research team captured 76 grizzly bears between 2016 and 2022, monitoring their behaviour, reproduction and survival using radio collars. While the bears roamed an area stretching seven kilometres into Alberta, most of their territory occupied a swath of the Rocky Mountains east of Cranbrook that contains five large open pit coal mines, and the towns of Elkwood, Sparwood and Fernie. The region is also an active recreational area, popular among off-road vehicles users, hunters, fishers and mountain bikers. Over seven years, they tracked 14 grizzly bear deaths -- six due to human-wildlife conflict, six involved in collisions with a vehicle or train, one which died of natural causes, and another whose death was suspected to be connected to a human. Lamb recalls the gruesome task of tracking down the young grizzlies after their radio collars stopped moving. They would be hit, and then they could make it a few hundred metres and I would find them dead, said Lamb. You know that the driver obviously knew they hit something but that as soon as that bear gets off the highway, it essentially does not exist from a data perspective. The province does not know about it. It just dies in the bush and nobody knows. Local bear population overwhelmed by high death rate Whether in a rail or road collision, Lamb estimates as few as one in five dead bears gets recorded. For a population of roughly 100 grizzly bears, Lamb says it is generally accepted that a mortality rate of roughly five per cent, or five bears, is sustainable. Road and rail deaths alone pushes the death rate to six per cent. Then there are deaths due to conflict with humans, which regularly doubles that death rate, meaning that without in-migration, seven more bears are dying every year than the population can sustain. Grizzlies from elsewhere have moved in, filling the habitat left empty by those dead bears. But a population that relies on migration raises serious questions over its long-term survival. We are always wondering, how sustainable is this on our end? Lamb said. For example, if some of the wilder areas around the valley, if they all of a sudden get developed and we build a coal mine there or we build new towns in these places, and we kind of reduce the pool that we are pulling dispersers in from -- maybe this currently sustainable dynamic, maybe it all collapses. Relying on migration to replace a fast-dying bear population could be a problem beyond B.C.'s grizzly dense Elk Valley. The more Lamb and his colleagues count dead grizzlies in somebody is front yard or on the side of the road, the higher chance their deaths could lead to a ripple effect that impacts the demographics of bears up to 100 kilometres away in places we think of as protected national parks. As Lamb put it: It is just this wicked spiral that we are in. Coexistence still a long way off In recent decades, a move to protect grizzly populations has often focused on reducing human-bear conflicts, either by locking away attractants or reducing the number of bears killed by hunters. From Yellowstone to the southern Canadian Rockies, conservation programs have allowed grizzlies to reclaim some of their lost historic range, which today sits at 55 per cent of its historic total. But even as grizzly populations rebound, humans have continued to expand their settlements, setting up a test as to whether people and bears can coexist. For Lamb, Elk Valley might be the deadliest place for grizzlies in B.C. But that fact also makes it an easy candidate for conservation. By focusing attention and dollars in one small area of the province, he says governments and locals could remove between a third and half of all grizzly road and rail collisions in all of B.C. There is a lot of bang for their buck investing in conservation solutions here, Lamb said. Despite at least 40 years of progress in advancing the protection of B.C.'s grizzly populations, Lamb says many communities have yet to switch to a coexistence mindset fast enough and are still not set up to live alongside large carnivores. More support needed for electric fencing, fruit tree removal Part of the gap is financial. Unlike Alberta or Montana, the B.C. government does not have dedicated coexistence programs to reduce the availability of attractants, namely garbage, livestock and fruit trees. Lamb said B.C. lacks a cost-sharing program that helps ranchers with electric fencing. Other residents, he said, may be convinced to remove a fruit tree in their backyard if there was better financial support. Glacier Media reached out repeatedly to multiple ministries for comment but had not heard back more than 48 hours past its initial deadline. When it comes to roadway deaths, Lamb says there is already a project that aims to set up electric fencing -- a proven deterrent for grizzlies -- along 27 of the valley's 100 kilometres of highway. The project, which is not finished and not fully funded, includes dedicated wildlife road crossings in what Lamb describes as a positive move forward. Railway collisions? Almost no progress, he said of negotiations with CP Rail, which recently rebranded as CPKC after buying out Kansas City Southern Railway in 2021. We really struggle working with the rail company. CPKC spokesperson Terry Cunha said the company has engaged with the Canadian government and other institutions concerning rail-related wildlife strikes. Actions we have taken include focusing efforts on vegetation management along the tracks in key areas through the mountains to reduce wildlife activity close to the railway, support wildlife sightlines and ensure room for animals to safely exit the tracks, Cunha said in an email.

Naw Bu told RFA earlier this week that he believed the junta was targeting the headquarters in the attack. Maran Bauk Lar said he was walking to his farm when he heard the explosion. When he returned, he found a deep pit and the remains of his sister-in-law and the other family members. My mother's body was completely dismembered, and her skull was broken, he said. Only the bones remain. My wife and children were killed under the collapsed building. Our dormitories were completely destroyed. There is nothing left. 'Emboldened by the indifference' The Mung Lai Hkyet camp has 658 residents, many of whom are now suffering from psychological trauma as they recover from the explosion, relief workers said. Survivors have been temporarily relocated to a church in Woichyai, an internally displaced persons camp in Lai Zar. At the moment, they are sleeping on the floor of the church, a person helping them said. They have to start a new life from scratch. They do not have a single penny in their hands.  The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of independent experts working to support human rights efforts in the country, urged the United Nations and its member states to hold the junta responsible for the attack. The Myanmar military is so emboldened by the indifference of the international community in response to its decades of atrocity crimes that it is now attacking camps for internally displaced people, said Yanghee Lee, a member of the council and a former YOU.N. Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. The military is flagrantly massacring the most vulnerable people in society, and yet YOU.N. entities in Myanmar will not even publicly name the military as the perpetrator, he said. At the State Department, spokesman Matthew Miller said that the United States was deeply concerned by reports of the explosion. We strongly condemn the military regime's ongoing attacks that have claimed thousands of lives since the February 2021 coup and continue to exacerbate the region's most severe humanitarian crisis, he said on Tuesday. 'The culture of military dictatorship' Fighting in the area between junta forces and the KIA has intensified since July. Lately, there have been artillery strikes from the junta almost every day, local residents said. While some residents said they heard a plane just before Monday's explosion, others told RFA that they heard nothing. The KIA has formed an investigation team to determine what caused the blast, Naw Bu said, adding that it may have been a bomb dropped by a junta-operated drone. They always target the public, not only in our territory in Kachin state, but across the country, he said of the junta. It is the culture of military dictatorship. RFA's calls on Wednesday to Win Ye Tun, the junta's social affairs minister and spokesman for Kachin state, for comments on the death toll at Mung Lai Hkyet went unanswered. Junta spokesman Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun told RFA that junta troops were not behind the attack on Mung Lai Hkyet. He speculated that it was caused by an accidental explosion at a warehouse where the KIA stores gunpowder. A Mung Lai Hkyet resident told RFA that it was totally untrue that there are weapons factories and arsenals in the camp. There is no arsenal, he said. There are only civilians who are displaced persons.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

One of the busiest ports in Japan, the Port of Nagoya was reportedly forced to halt cargo loading operations in early July following a ransomware attack. Threat actors associated with Lockbit 3.0 claimed responsibility. While the port has since been able to recover operations, this event once again underscored that cybersecurity is at the core of maintaining secure maritime infrastructure and facilitating robust economic supply chains. From the typical IT business networks that facilitate administrative processes like any other industry, to the operational technology (OT) assets that handle the movement of cargo around the facility, the attack surface and significance of ports can represent an attractive target for a variety of bad actors. Ransomware Operations Today To better understand the Port of Nagoya cyberattack in context, it is important to first assess the current state of ransomware. The last several years have witnessed a growing spate of ransomware attacks across the globe that have disrupted and impacted virtually every sector. Since late 2019, an increasing number of these operations have been coupled with data theft and the threat to leak internal, often sensitive information to the public. This has given threat actors another vector to extort organizations beyond just the encryption of their data and systems, causing halts to workforce operations. Such leaked data on name and shame sites operated by extortion actors can spell brand and reputation damage for the victim organizations. Over the years the public success of these operations has attracted additional entrants into this criminal industry, who have facilitated and specialized in niche aspects from providing initial access to post-compromise exploitation to development of the ransomware itself. Often hackers will work with and switch between various Ransomware-as-a-Service providers and partners. Even nation state groups have seen the value offered by this disruptive and often deniable capability, with utilization of ransomware by suspected Russian, North Korea, and Iranian actors-among others and for differing reasons. Overall, while Mandiant responded to fewer investigations involving ransomware in 2022 than the year prior, this threat continues to be elevated. Cybersecurity and the Maritime Sector So why target ports? Broadly speaking, the two primary categories of adversaries that maritime infrastructure faces are criminal and state-sponsored threats. For criminal and financially motivated hackers, while data theft has increasingly become an attractive extortion tactic as discussed above, certain sectors are more sensitive to the actual shutdown caused by ransomware itself. For example, quarter after quarter, Mandiant has observed the manufacturing industry to be one of the most heavily targeted sectors by ransomware threat actors. Corporations in this sector are much more sensitive to any downtime caused by a loss of continuity of operations, and can often directly ascribe a monetary impact to these events. The same holds true for much of the transportation and maritime sectors as well. Even though many threat actors in the ransomware space are sector-agnostic in their targeting, some may have a tendency to pursue targets more who they believe have a greater incentive to recover operations. In looking at nation-state threats, perhaps one of the most significant cyberattacks on maritime infrastructure and ports was the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack. While not initially targeted at port infrastructure, the wormable capability of the malware expanded beyond initial targets in Ukraine to impact the operations of maritime giant Maersk, among others. Though it initially appeared to be ransomware, with no actual means for decryption it functioned more similar to a wiper malware in bricking the assets it impacted, and was ultimately attributed to Russia. Ports are not the only targets within the maritime sector at risk from state-sponsored hackers. In August 2022, Mandiant publicly uncovered a suspected Iranian cyber intrusion campaign targeting shipping entities among other industries. The assessment of the analysts who examined this campaign was that the purpose of the activity was likely espionage, especially as some of the targeted entities handled the shipping for sensitive components. This set of activity was also notable given some of the very public incidents of kinetic engagement between Iranian naval assets and commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. Using cyber espionage to potentially gaining access to information about shipping routes and planned travel could facilitate such operations and ultimately provided another notable case study as to how nation states might target the maritime sector. Anticipating Future Threats Regardless of the vector or intent, an important question to ponder is how the targeting of maritime infrastructure and ports may evolve given the many public incidents over the years, up to and including the Port of Nagoya cyberattack. Successful, public cyber operations-even those with limited impact-can beget further operations. Financially motivated criminals see opportunities to make money. State-sponsored groups might see ways to disable or disrupt key economic nodes under the plausible deniability of pretending to be criminal operations. In regions where the geopolitical environment is fraught with increased tensions-such as those faced by the neighbors of the cyber-capable and antagonistic North Korean state-preparation and a proactive security posture is paramount. How should security professionals at ports respond to current and future threats? First, segmenting and hardening networks from the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) most common to disruptive actors of any kind can make infrastructure more resilient. In particular, increasing the difficulty of a successful compromise by a threat actor into the IT infrastructure to move laterally into OT infrastructure is key. Having backups, and testing being able to restore from backups is also essential. Lastly, threat intelligence that is tracking both new and emerging threats as well as the campaigns from known actors, can be key to ensuring proactive defenses. Though there is sometimes the view that activity such as ransomware is more of a concern for organizations in the United States or Europe, as the Port of Nagoya cyberattack demonstrated, actors such as those behind Lockbit 3.0 can launch attacks against targets globally. As ports have an important role to play in the global economy, ensuring their security and continued operations is in the interests of all of us.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Please try again later verifyErrors  A former college dean who dedicated years of her life to researching a cure for cancer was gunned down on a walking trail near campus last week and her killer is still on the loose, leaving a Vermont town on edge. Those who knew Honoree Fleming, and even some who did not, were left shocked and heartbroken by her tragic passing, evident by the hundreds of tributes on social media. The retired Castleton dean of education, 77, was found dead on 5 October on a rail trail about a mile from campus, police said. She had been shot in the head and her death was ruled a homicide. Fleming's brutal murder made headlines across the country, and police released a sketch of a man wanted for questioning after witnesses described someone acting odd on the trail that day. Few details have been released about the killing, but many who knew Fleming have instead decided to share their favourite moments of her and how the accomplished scientist impacted their lives. She should be remembered not by the way she died, but for the beautiful person she was and the legacy she leaves behind, Linda Coulombe, a former student of Fleming's, told The Independent. She should be remembered for her multitudes of accomplishments and the lives she touched along the way. Ms Coulombe is an alumna of Trinity College, where Fleming worked prior to becoming the dean of education at Castleton State College, which is now known as Vermont State University Castleton Campus. I had the privilege of being touched by her professional kindness which altered my life, she said. She molded me into the woman I am today. I just wish she knew that - I wish she knew the impact she had on so many women. Ms Coulombe explained that she was one of the many underprivileged students Fleming took under her wing and mentored. She was a first-generation college student and would later become the first lawyer in her family. She was kind and patient and empathic and I carry that with me, Ms Coulombe said. I think the best way to honor her is to remember how she treated others and to live like her. To ask how would Honoree act? The former student said she believes the beloved dean might have even been sympathetic to her killer. She did not deserve to die like this, her family did not deserve this, she said. But you know, I bet she would have been empathetic to whoever did this. She would forgive him. That is just the kind of person she was. Joe Mark, a former academic dean at Castleton told local Vermont paper, the VTDigger that Fleming had a particular interest in supporting students who were not given a lot of privilege in life, like Ms Coulombe. He hired Fleming as an associate academic dean in 2002. Her intelligence coupled with her empathy and caring were sort of what made her remarkable, he said. Fleming's empathy played a big role in Ms Coulombe's life and shaped her years following college. She recalled struggling with what she now knows was imposter syndrome and how Fleming built her up as she sat in her office crying. She went on to graduate with her degree in sciences in 2000 and worked in the field for years before a career change led her to becoming a lawyer. Looking back, she played a part in that, she said. I would not be where I am now if it were not for her. She really was a role model for so many women over the years. Anne Slonaker, a Castleton professor who was hired by Fleming, told the VTDigger that Fleming served as a model to many first-generation college students and women who sometimes questioned whether they could establish a career in higher education. We talked about imposter syndrome in higher ed, Slonaker said. But I think Honoree helped them to understand what they could do with their lives. Susannah Gravel was another first-generation student who was mentored by Fleming at Castleton, and was left devastated by her murder. I went to her for help, and she immediately dropped what she was doing and took care of everything, saving me time, frustration, and money, Ms Gravel shared in a Facebook tribute to Fleming. She was not like any other administrative person I have ever met in my life. I am forever grateful that she was there and helped me get to where I am today. She was why I did not leave Castleton and continued believing that going to college was the right choice. That is why I am so heartbroken today to hear that this unnecessary death was hers. -- feeling devastated. Fleming grew up poor in New York City, the youngest of four children, and was raised by her mother who came from an impoverished family in Ireland, according to her husband Ron Powers' 2017 book No One Cares About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health in America. Her father had died of alcoholism. Fleming and her siblings went on to earn degrees in higher education and in 1975, a year before meeting her husband, she earned a doctorate in biophysics from the University of Chicago, according to his book. She married the Pulitzer Prize-winning and New York Times best-selling author Ron Powers, who co-authored Flags Of Our Fathers. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for criticism as a television-radio columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. The couple had two sons and moved to Vermont, where Fleming taught biochemistry at Middlebury College, and then to the now-defunct Trinity College in Burlington. In 2012, she retired as dean of education at what was then called Castleton State College. Fleming was killed just a few days before they were to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. Those of you who knew her know that she was beautifully named. I have never known a more sterling heart and soul than hers. She has taken far more than half my own heart and soul with her, Powers wrote following the shocking news of her death. Fleming started on the hike at around 4pm from the pavilion area at the college campus and was walking south towards Poultney, just a few miles from the New York state border. Her husband later wrote that the rail trail was one of her favourite walks. On Monday, before the sketch was released, Powers wrote that his grief counselor, who has been a liaison between him and the police, said the first people to come upon Honoree's body were two rail trail walkers, a middle-aged husband and wife. The woman ran for help. The man stayed with Honoree. She was clearly dead, but he stayed with her anyway. He knelt beside her and, I gather, tried to communicate to her that she was not alone, Powers wrote. I have not met this man, this couple. I do not know their names. The counselor believes that it would be unwise to meet them in these first few heartbreak-drenched days. But I will meet them. Dean and I will meet them. And we will say our thanks. Fleming's death is not the only tragedy to strike the family. In 2005, their son Kevin died by suicide after struggling with schizophrenia for three years. Their surviving son, Dean, was also diagnosed with schizophrenia and has been undergoing treatment, according to Powers' book. He wrote on Facebook about how he missed his mother's home-cooked meals, her wise counsel, and her laughter. He also wrote about the sacrifices she made for the family, like driving the siblings to activities and buying recycled clothing to save money. I miss making her coffee. I miss how she always stocked egg nog or food or coffee or orange juice. I miss her delicious meals. I miss seeing her sitting on her bed with Maggie. I miss her guidance and counsel during this life changing event. I miss knowing that I could count on her to be my buddy at home. Every time I went to a music festival I would call mom every day to check in on her and the dogs. I love you mom thanks for your beautiful sunrise on your first morning in Heaven. Powers did not respond to a request for an interview, but has continued to post on Facebook since her death, reminding the community of Fleming's goodness and spiritual beauty and achievements in the world of science far exceed all the words I have written in my life. On Tuesday, he recalled the time she spent after retiring organizing her cell photographs and lab notes into papers at their home in Castleton. She composed and finished her decades-long cycle of lab investigations at our kitchen table, Powers wrote. I grew fondly accustomed to walking into the kitchen in the mornings (I was the late riser) to find Honoree in her red bathrobe, a neglected cup of coffee at her elbow, typing away. Powers said Fleming had faced sexism throughout her career and that she was a consummate and visionary 'lady scientist' in a world that still does not recognize the worth and achievements of lady scientists, he wrote. After retiring from Castleton in 2012, Fleming returned to her work in cellular biology, which began when she was a research associate at New York City's Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai in the 1980s. One of the first things she did was to dig out her research and begin working on it again, Joe Mark, the former academic dean at Castleton, said. Earlier this year, just months before her murder, Fleming published an article on cell differentiation in the open-access journal Advances in Bioscience and Biotechnology. She was always a very dedicated scientist and always cared deeply about rigorous scientific research, he said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a YOU.S. plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments had been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken and Kuleba discussed the latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said veteran officers Richard Mendez and Raul Ortiz had just arrived at work around 11 p.m. Thursday when they heard breaking glass and saw several people breaking into a vehicle in the parking garage area. A confrontation ensued, and Mendez was shot multiple times. Ortiz was shot once in his arm, Stanford said, and one of the suspects was also wounded. Both officers were taken to hospitals, but Mendez was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later, Stanford said. Ortiz remained hospitalized Friday in stable condition. Both were assigned to the airport unit. The suspects fled the scene in an SUV that authorities later learned had been reported stolen in the city about a week ago. The vehicle was later seen at a hospital in Philadelphia dropping off 18-year-old Jesus Herman Madera Duran, who authorities say was believed to be involved in the confrontation with the officers. Duran was shot in the chest, abdomen and left arm and was pronounced dead around 11:30 p.m. Thursday. It was not clear if any other suspects were wounded in the shooting, authorities said, or how many of them had fired weapons. The shooting took place in the garage for the airport's Terminal D, which was temporarily closed during the initial investigation but later reopened. Stanford noted that the shooting came only a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this, he said. Mendez, 50, was a 22-year veteran of the force and was married with one daughter. His gun has not been located, Stanford said, and it is not yet known if anyone fired the weapon during the confrontation. Ortiz, 60, is a 20-year veteran of the department. He is married with three children. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said law enforcement staff across multiple agencies were working to identify those responsible but said they lacked the ability to match crime scene ballistics to firearms through a database of gun sales, citing a lack of gun regulation. Pennsylvania state law prevents law enforcement and government agencies from having firearm registries. Joseph Regan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge, mourned the officer's death and said members were praying for the wounded officer. We lost a hero, Regan said. A reward of 148,500 was being offered for information leading to an arrest. Two local police unions -- Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 and Lodge 27 in Delaware County -- initially provided a combined 30,000 to fund the reward. They soon received donations from numerous police groups, businesses and residents in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The reward would be in addition to a 20,000 reward that the city has offered for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Speaking Friday at a news conference to announce the police unions' reward, Lodge 5 President John McNesby said the city's police force was undermanned and said more officers were needed in the streets. He also was critical of the district attorney's office, saying that if violent offenders are not prosecuted that sends a message they can do what they want. Calling the two officers standouts and noting their long service to the city, McNesby said the loss was a tough one for their colleagues and the department. I saw more tears last night than I have ever seen in all my years here, McNesby said. President Joe Biden, who was in Philadelphia on Friday, offered his condolences the families of the officers. They put their lives on the line to protect this community, he said.  Bruce Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Kevin McCarthy. They are also dialing up the rhetoric against the GOP's new nominee for speaker, prominent Donald Trump ally Jim Jordan of Ohio, blasting him as an insurrectionist, election denier and extremist. House Republicans have selected as their nominee to be the speaker of the people's House the chairman of the chaos caucus, a defender in a dangerous way of dysfunction, and an extremist extraordinaire, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday on the steps of the Capitol, flanked by dozen of Democratic lawmakers. His focus has been on peddling lies and conspiracy theories and driving division amongst the American people. House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., labeled Jordan an insurrectionist and said he would be on a glide path to becoming speaker if not for the unified opposition of Democrats. He was directly involved in the right-wing coup that sought to overturn the 2020 election, she said, referring to Jordan and the 147 congressional Republicans who objected to certifying presidential election results on January 6, 2021. Every Republican who cast their vote for him is siding with an insurrectionist against our democracy, Clark said. The fiery comments represent an early marker from Democratic leaders about how they would seek to tie the GOP majority, particularly swing-district members they are targeting in 2024, to Jordan's brand if Republicans elect him speaker. I think moderate Republicans should be freaked out with Jim Jordan as speaker, said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., a member of Democratic leadership. He predicted that Jordan would push for a national abortion ban and impeach President Joe Biden. Lieu also warned that if Jordan is speaker, he would fight to avoid certifying a potential Biden re-election victory in 2024: Jim Jordan is one of the leaders of not respecting the will of American people in elections, and he will absolutely do everything he can to not certify a Biden victory. That is what he did before. Republican allies of Jordan defended him Friday, with Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., saying a bunch of us will help him get the votes to become speaker. Asked what Jordan can do to change minds, Armstrong said: Talk to people, listen to people. He is really good at it. Everybody sees the partisan brawler on TV because he is on message, he is an effective communicator, but he is the only guy that has the credibility with our base to do what we need to do and not get beat up. Jeffries said Democrats want a bipartisan path to reopening the House but did not outline what that would look like. Democrats unanimously nominated Jeffries to be speaker, but there is no chance of him winning when Republicans have a 221-212 majority. Still, Democrats say the onus is on the GOP to negotiate with them and make concessions if they want help electing a speaker. There are no serious discussions taking place on a coalition speaker picked with bipartisan votes, according to senior lawmakers and aides in both parties. No Republican has come to leadership to have a serious conversation of substance, said a senior Democratic aide. This is on Republicans to come to the Democrats to try to find a compromise. A quartet of centrist Democrats -- Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Susie Lee of Nevada, Ed Case of Hawaii, and Jared Golden of Maine -- sent a letter to temporary speaker Patrick McHenry supporting an enhancement of his powers, in 15-day increments, so that the House can conduct business while it is without an elected speaker. But that letter is unlikely to have much of an impact as McHenry lacks the ability to enhance his own power without a majority of the House voting to give him that authority. Many Republicans oppose that idea. They adjourned for the weekend after nominating Jordan in a 124-81 vote behind closed doors. On a second ballot, asking members if they could support Jordan on the House floor, he won 152 votes with 55 opposed. He will need 217 floor votes to win the job. With no immediate path to achieving that, Republicans adjourned the House for the weekend. Despite all the chaos in their ranks, conservative Republicans say they have no concern that some in their party may heed the calls by Democrats to join them and elect a bipartisan speaker. That is the thing that gets you beat in a primary, said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. You would get your a-- beat, said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, said those discussions have only happened outside the GOP conference, not among Republican lawmakers. People can talk a big game about that. I have not personally heard anybody talk about that; it is only hearsay, he said. But I think that is pretty nuclear. Let us keep this conventional. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., who chairs the Democrats' campaign arm, rejected Republican claims that Democrats are at fault for the predicament due to their votes to remove McCarthy. It is really appalling that they cannot even own their mess, she said. They have been unable to govern from the beginning of this Congress and unable to work with Democrats. All they seem focused on is fighting each other. When I have gone through battleground districts across the country, folks want to see governance work, DelBene said. All they have seen from the Republican side is chaos and dysfunction.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

A person who was brought to a hospital privately and died there may have been involved in the Thursday night shooting, but investigators have not confirmed that, interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said at a late-night news conference.

Stanford said the officers were arriving at work and were parked in the garage shortly after 11 pm when they saw several people breaking into a vehicle in the parking garage area. As the officers approached, the suspects opened fire, hitting one officer several times in the upper body and the other in the arm, Stanford said. Also Read  Israel-Palestine War: Israel Infantry Forces, Tanks Enter Gaza Strip Territory in 'Localised Raids'. One officer died shortly after 11.30 pm at a hospital. His name was not released, but he was 50 years old and had 22 years with the force, Stanford said. The officer was married and had one child. They are here at the hospital, as you can imagine, heartbroken, Stanford said. The other officer was in stable condition. He is 60 years old and has 20 years with the police department, Stanford said. Both were assigned to the airport unit. Police said suspects in the shooting fled in a stolen Dodger Durango, which was being sought, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The same model of car dropped off an 18-year-old man at the hospital. He had two gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead there, the paper said. That person was very similar to the suspect description, but investigators had not confirmed his involvement, Stanford said. The shooting took place in the garage for the airport's Terminal D, which was temporarily closed during the initial investigation but later reopened. Stanford noted that the shooting came only a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this, he said. We just had three officers shot last week. And then this tonight, so you can imagine what we feel. We can imagine what this department is going through. And quite frankly, how the city should be feeling. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said law enforcement staff across multiple agencies were working to identify those responsible, but said they lacked the ability to match crime scene ballistics to firearms through a database of gun sales, citing a lack of gun regulation. Pennsylvania state law prevents law enforcement and government agencies from having firearm registries. Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge President Joseph Regan mourned the officer's death and said members were praying for the wounded officer. We lost a hero today. Regan said. A reward of USD 148,500 was being offered for information leading to an arrest. Two local police unions -- Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 and Lodge 27 in Delaware County -- initially provided a combined USD 30,000 to fund the reward. They soon received donations from numerous police groups, businesses and residents in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The reward would be in addition to a USD 20,000 reward that the city has offered for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Speaking Friday at a news conference to announce the police unions' reward, Lodge 5 President John McNesby said the city's police force was under manned and said more officers were needed in the streets. He also was critical of the district attorney's office, saying that if violent offenders are not prosecuted that sends a message they can do what they want. Calling the two officers standouts and noting their long service to the city, McNesby said the loss was a tough one for their colleagues and the department. I saw more tears last night than I have ever seen in all my years here, McNesby said. President Joe Biden, who was in Philadelphia on Friday, offered his condolences the families of the officers. They put their lives on the line to protect this community, he said. (AP)",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

In Ashdod, about 40 miles from the Gaza border and a frequent target of Hamas rockets, warnings of a possible air attack sounded Friday night, alerting people to get to a shelter. In one of those shelters, a woman runs in, wearing pajamas and shouting into a phone: I was going to keep Shabbat, but I am too stressed! I decided to smoke! If this were a film, the scene might offer a moment of levity, but here in reality, Israelis say they are afraid of what is to come in the days ahead. Follow live updates from NBC News here. All the people are so traumatized from the attacks, an officer who identifies himself as a fighter in a special police unit said, referring to Hamas' unprecedented attack almost one week ago. Everybody is, like, very sad, you know? But you see how everybody is laughing? the officer, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said, gesturing to a crowd of fellow officers laughing and talking nearby. We will cry after the war. It is not time to cry. According to the officer, authorities in Israel have gotten a surge in calls from residents who are on high alert and scared for their safety. Sometimes it ends up being nothing, sometimes it is something, he said. They call the police for anything, he said. Asked if he had any fears himself, the officer said: No ... Like, I think everybody is scared, but we cannot be scared. The officer acknowledged the criticisms Israel has faced in the wake of its bombardment of Gaza and ordering residents of northern Gaza to evacuate in the wake of Hamas' attack on Saturday, but he said: People hating on us, it is just useless for them. Obviously, I am not happy when I see all these Palestinian people killed, he said. But added, If we have to choose between them or us, we cannot let things go sometimes. ... If we do not do nothing, they will throw us at sea and they will keep killing us, so this is war for us to exist. Earlier in the day, in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, Noy Fliker, 27, who has a brother serving with the Israeli military in southern Israel and a close family friend, Omer Shemtov, 20, who was taken hostage by Hamas at the festival where at least 260 people were killed on Saturday, said she was very worried -- for her brother, for her friend and for herself. Fliker expressed similar sentiments as the officer, saying that while she wishes good people could all be safe, over the past seven days, she has been telling herself she cannot feel sorry for what is happening to people in Gaza, where almost 1,850 people have been killed and thousands more have been injured and displaced since the attacks. A lot of us in Israel, we love life and we just want to live our life. I do not like politics, I do not like to speak about it, Fliker said. Now, after what they have done to us, you cannot feel sorry for them. I am sorry, but you just cannot. Asked if she recognizes the difference between civilians in Gaza and Hamas militants, Fliker said she does, but that protecting Israel, where at least 1,300 people have died since the Hamas attack, is her priority. Of course, I wish God would come here and say, 'He is evil' and 'He is good,' but we cannot know that, she said. In the days since Hamas' ambush, similar comments appear to be echoing across Israel, including from the nation's president. On Thursday, before Israel ordered the entire population of northern Gaza to evacuate south, which Hamas urged Gazans to ignore, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said civilians in Gaza could have risen up and fought against Hamas, comments that appeared to lay partial blame on Gazans for the attack. Asked during a news conference what measures Israel was taking to not harm civilians living in Gaza, Herzog replied: It is an entire nation that is out there that is responsible. It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. It is absolutely not true. They could have risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup d'etat, Herzog added. The comments came before Israel delivered its order for the entire population of northern Gaza to evacuate south, forcing more than 1 million people to decide whether to flee their own homes. The officer said he feels that both the events that have unfolded over the past week and those to come will mark a turning point in a decadeslong conflict. It feels unreal, he said. I am not a general. I am just a soldier. But I just have a feeling that nothing's going to be the same again.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

It will be steered westward over the next week. The system could threaten the Caribbean. Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. A tropical disturbance is making an unusually late voyage across the deep tropical Atlantic and it poses a threat to the Caribbean in a week or so. The disturbance, a tropical wave tagged Invest 94L by the National Hurricane Center, is located at a rather low latitude between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles. The wave is disorganized, but environmental conditions should improve by early next week. Formation is increasingly likely into next week as the wave gets closer to the Caribbean and it is currently given a high chance of development into a tropical depression or storm. The system will be moving westward across the main development region (MDR) through the next week due to a hefty Bermuda high locked into place to its north. Clockwise flow around the Bermuda High will push it toward the eastern Caribbean by the end of the upcoming week. The next named storm of the season will be Tammy. Tammy could form in an odd location, then take an odd path. The tropical Atlantic is the strip of ocean that stretches from Africa to the Caribbean south of 23.5 degrees north latitude. Named storms more commonly form in this region in the peak months of August and September. That is when water temperatures are most favorable for development in that region. They begin cooling off by late September and become too cool for tropical development by the end of the calendar year. This trajectory is also an odd one for the middle of October. Systems that form in the open Atlantic tend to curve northward or eastward away from the Caribbean or YOU.S. mainland as the jet stream begins to scoop such systems out of the tropics and carry them away. This is what has happened to 94L's predecessor, Tropical Storm Sean, which is expected to move northwestward while gradually unraveling. Westward tracks are not unheard of, however. Hurricane Tomas in 2010, 1999's Hurricane Jose, and 2014's Hurricane Joan were a few that took a similar track. Here are some more. Very few of these systems make it as far west as Jamaica. Caribbean impacts remain unknown. With nearly a week to go, there are still many things to figure out in this forecast. The strength of the system and its precise track are two of those things that will dictate what, if any, impacts may occur in the islands. Interests in the eastern and northern Caribbean should keep checking the forecast over the next week.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. The Korean Central News Agency said Kim made the comments during a two-day session of the country's rubber-stamp parliament, which amended the constitution to include his policy of expanding the country's nuclear weapons program. In Russia, Kim deepened comradely fellowship and friendly ties with Putin, North Korean state media reported. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

The crew was practicing touch-and-go landings at Sioux Gateway Airport during a local training mission, the Air Force said. Touch-and-go maneuvers allow pilots to practice ascending and descending by taking off, circling back and momentarily landing before climbing again.

The extensive network is believed to be as much as 100ft (30m) beneath the surface in some places and makes up a central part of defences the terrorist group has spent years preparing. Tunnel entrances are hidden in the bottom floors of houses, mosques and schools, while the territory's narrow streets and alleyways are expected to have been laid with booby traps and homemade bombs in preparation for any Israeli attack. Hamas' preparations will mean any ground assault into northern Gaza will be fraught with danger and likely to cause heavy casualties on both sides, as well as the civilian residents who remain. The difficulties of clearing the defences will be increased by the potential use of human shields from the local population and even from among the scores of Israeli hostages seized at the weekend. Israeli officials have also alleged the group builds military bases near residential buildings and has also in the past hidden weapons in homes, or even schools and health facilities. Dr Daphn Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare at Reichman University in Israel, said the tunnels beneath Gaza were deeper and more sophisticated than cross-border passages used to sneak into Israeli territory. She told the BBC: The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence. The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand. Israel said it had already begun targeting the vast network as part of its bombing campaign in response to Saturday's unprecedented incursion. Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas: We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built, Jonathan Conricus an IDF spokesman, told a briefing on Thursday. These are not bunkers for Gazan civilians. It is only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel. Hamas started building tunnels in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops from the area almost two decades ago but ramped up the construction after both Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the area in 2007. After the last flare-up of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2021, the IDF claimed to have destroyed more than 60 miles of tunnels. Hamas, however, claimed at the time that only five per cent were damaged as it boasted that its underground infrastructure was at least 300 miles long, which makes it longer than the London Underground. The network, however, is out of bounds for civilians, and there are no underground shelters for residents in Gaza who have been living under constant airstrikes since Saturday. Even if the Israeli forces are able to clear the area, they will then have to decide whether to withdraw or to occupy the territory, which could take large numbers of troops. Sir Tom Beckett, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies - Middle East, said: If the IDF attempts to mount a garrison large enough to control Gaza while continuing to protect the country from threats emanating from the West Bank, southern Lebanon and Syria, its capacity will soon be stretched thinly.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The Southeast Asian country, one of Israel's biggest sources of migrant labor, has had some of the highest casualties among foreign nationals in the Israel-Hamas war. The Thai Foreign Ministry said Thursday that 21 of its nationals had been killed and 14 wounded, while 16 others are believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Other countries from which large numbers of migrant workers go to Israel have also reported deaths. On Friday, as more than 250 citizens of Nepal arrived in Kathmandu on a special flight from Tel Aviv, the government said it was working to bring back the bodies of 10 agriculture students killed by Hamas at the kibbutz where they were staying under an Israeli government earn and learn program. Another is missing. The Philippines confirmed a third death Friday, all of them reportedly caregivers, and said three other nationals remained missing. Israel relies heavily on migrant workers like Suriya, 38, a married father of two from Thailand's Udon Thani province who works on a flower farm in Netanya, a city on the Mediterranean coast, about 20 miles north of Tel Aviv. He said the impact of the rockets Hamas fired toward Tel Aviv could be felt all the way in Netanya. I could feel the ground vibrating when I slept at night and that kept me awake and thinking about returning home, said Suriya, who arrived in Israel last year. Especially in the first two days when I watched the news, all I thought was, should I return home? Suriya has decided to stay put for now, as Netanya is more than 60 miles from the border with the Gaza Strip where most of the fighting has occurred, though even there he said he saw two rockets in the sky Thursday. Others have made a different call: He said a friend who lived closer to the attacks had asked his employer to help him buy a plane ticket home for about 700. Almost 6,000 of the 30,000 Thais in Israel have asked to be repatriated, according to Thailand's Foreign Ministry, which is arranging flights. A group of 19 Thais were scheduled to return home from Israel on Friday night local time, in addition to an initial group of 41 who arrived Thursday. The group that arrived in Bangkok on Thursday was met at the airport by multiple Cabinet ministers, and included two men injured in the violence who were in wheelchairs. Two others had sustained injuries on their arms. One of the men in the wheelchairs, Kratchakorn Putsorn, said that when the Hamas attack began Saturday, his employer hid him and other farmworkers on the property. They emerged for lunch around noon when the situation appeared to be calmer. But as they were returning, he said, they heard gunshots, and Kratchakorn felt something hit his knee. I thought it was a rock, but when I looked down I knew it was not a rock as it went through, he told reporters. So I told my friend to crouch because we were hit. As his employer tried to speed the truck away, Kratchakorn said, the terrorists continued chasing it and firing, hitting three other people. I thought on that day that we would not survive because they fired the bullets nonstop, he said. Migrant workers from Thailand, the Philippines and elsewhere go abroad in search of higher wages as farmworkers, caregivers and health care professionals, so that they can send money home to their families, boosting their countries' economies in the process. But they also face abuse and harsh working conditions, including in Israel where Thai farmworkers interviewed by Human Rights Watch have described being underpaid, working excessively long hours and other rights violations. Suriya said that if all Thai workers were to leave, it would have a noticeable impact on the Israeli labor force. Every farm I know, there are Thai workers, he said. We are very good at agricultural work and most farms here employ Thai workers mostly. Orna Sagiv, the Israeli ambassador to Thailand, said she met with Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Friday and that they were focused on assisting the Thai workers who had been affected by the war and supporting their families. To Israeli farmers, Thai workers are not just employees; they are an integral part of their family, she said in a post on X. Israel deeply values their hard work and acknowledges the significant role they play in the country's agriculture sector. Israel is also home to 30,000 people from the Philippines, many of whom work as caregivers. One of the Filipinos killed, a newly married caregiver who had been in Israel for six years, was shot with her employer inside their house on Saturday by Hamas gunmen, Philippine officials said. The woman, identified in the Philippine media as Angelyn Peralta Aguirre, 33, from Pangasinan, was praised by Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, for staying with her older patient. Despite having a chance to flee the Hamas terror attacks, Angeline showed unbelievable humanity and loyalty by remaining Nira's side during the violence, resulting in both of them being brutally murdered by Hamas, Hassan-Nahoum said in a post on X on Wednesday. Unimaginable honor in the face of evil. The Philippine Foreign Ministry said Friday that its repatriation efforts were now focused on Gaza, a densely populated enclave where there are fears Israel is about to launch a ground offensive. Among the 131 Filipino citizens there, 92 are asking for repatriation from Gaza, which has long been under a land, air and sea blockade enforced by Israel and Egypt. Far from the Gaza border, Suriya says he is relatively safe for the moment in Netanya, with the closest military target for Hamas being the Tel Aviv airport about 25 miles away. I will give it a week and if the situation is not getting better, I will then buy the plane ticket to go back on my own, he said. If that is the case, I think I will probably arrive in Thailand at the same time as those who have registered with the Thai government.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Nothing Starmer and his right-wing lackeys said has shifted the likes of Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers union General Secretary Mick Lynch, Communication Workers Union (CWU) Dave Ward and Unite's Sharon Graham to abandon this lie -- not the endorsement of Shadow Chancellor Rachael Reeves by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, not Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting saying Labour will not waste money we do not have on the National Health Service (NHS), and certainly not the numerous declarations of support for Israel's bloody repression of the Palestinians. Lynch and Ward instead doubled down on the relentless boosting of Labour they pioneered in their Enough is Enough campaign to oppose demands to link the struggles of rail, post, health workers and many others in a general strike to bring down the Tories. Likewise Graham, who once threatened to end Unite's funding and affiliation with Labour if it did not start representing workers. What passes for their criticism of Starmer as an individual is framed entirely as friendly advice to the leader of a government they will loyally support. And as far as their members are concerned, the message is that all roads lead to a Starmer government. Labour's naked pro-capitalist and pro-war agenda, wrapped up in the Union Jack and the invoking of country first nationalism, is a blueprint for deeper social spending cuts and a clampdown on strikes and democratic rights. Lynch at a fringe meeting of the the Trade Union Coordinating Committee was obliged to make some noises about how Labour has been embraced as the favoured party of big business, with corporate attendees outnumbering party delegates and afforded pride of place. But this was only while repeating the lie that Labour will implement a New Deal ending casualisation and low pay. His bluster was restricted to only those companies' at the conference directly associated with outsourcing, stating they should be called out for super-exploitation by Starmer and his deputy leader. Angela Rayner and Keir Starmer have said it in front of me and everyone else at this top tableWe're going to have the biggest wave of insourcing in the history of British industry. Well, that is exactly what we need because the outsourcing model is what is degrading our working-class communities. At another fringe meeting Lynch claimed that Starmer's Labour should not be backsliding over pledges to renationalise the national railways -- Labour should be shouting from the rooftops that the era of privatisation is over. He knows full well that the call for Starmer to sound the death knell for privatisation is a pipe dream. Policy and manifesto pledges count for nothing. The only constituency Labour is accountable to is the City of London. Reeves, who predictably dubbed herself the Iron Chancellor, ruled out nationalisations in July of the rail, water, postal and energy companies, stating, To be spending billions of pounds on nationalising things, that just does not stack up against our fiscal rules. Lynch speaks as someone who has driven the national rail dispute waged by 40,000 RMT members since last June into the ground. The first instalment of this came with a sellout deal imposed on 20,000 RMT members at Network Rail in March last year, followed by an agreement to suspend further strikes at the 14 train companies since early September on the pretext of awaiting the outcome of the public consultation over the closure of around 1,000 ticket offices which he himself described as a sham. The union executive had already signed a dispute resolution agreement in January, which was rejected by the membership because it accepted the entire framework for closing and repurposing ticket offices, inferior terms for new entrants and brutal restructuring. Ward, for his part, is a hate figure among CWU members thanks to the betrayal he inflicted on the year-long dispute by over 100,000 workers at Royal Mail in July. Barely able to show his face before the membership, he still had the gall to move the motion at conference on what was described as the flagship New Deal policy -- more window dressing for deepening the pro-company collusion of the union bureaucracy against the working class. The same fire and rehire measures the New Deal is supposed to end are being policed by the CWU in its agreement with Royal Mail. A central feature of what workers have dubbed the surrender document is the implementation of a two-tier workforce with new entrants on inferior pay and terms, with long serving postal workers forced out by crippling workloads and management bullying. Ward's speech won a standing ovation from the party faithful, who at best know nothing and at worst do not care about his betrayals. But as soon as the video was posted on the CWU Facebook page it met with instant derision from postal workers, with one dubbing him Dave Fraud. Ward appealed to Starmer to take a leaf out of the book of Joe Biden and show up at a picket line. His attempt to spread the US trade union bureaucracy's lie that Biden is the most pro-Labor US President in history is a warning about how Ward and company will function as apologists for every rotten action by a labour government. The White House has used collective bargaining with the union apparatus to strangle strikes and to enforce substandard contracts in the oil industry, ports and at major logistics giant, UPS. And when this has failed, the workers friend Biden and his left apologists such as Alaxandria Ocasio-Cortez did not hesitate in banning a strike by 100,000 railroad workers last year. Biden's solitary visit to a picket line was to back the United Auto Workers (UAW) bureaucracy vetoing the 97 percent mandate for strike action by 150,000 workers at the Big Three car manufacturers -- GM, Ford and Stellantis. This has kept 80 percent of car workers on the job four weeks into the dispute, pumping out profits while the UAW negotiate behind closed doors how to sellout the fight to reverse decades of attacks. It is this full integration of the unions into the apparatus of the state and corporate management to discipline workers and facilitate Biden's war against Russia and blood curdling support for Israel that Ward wants to emulate with Starmer. Graham's performance was made up of more hackneyed phrases about holding Starmer's feet to the fire. But this has not stood in the way of Graham continuing to bankroll Labour from her members' dues to the tune of more than 1 million in the first quarter of 2023. In a speech before conference Graham declared the big question for the next government is who pays for the crisis? Because it cannot be everyday working men and women who paid for the last. But since winning office in August 2020, she has made sure that her own members have already paid the price. With a membership of over a million in the private and public sector, Graham has performed the role of chief industrial fire fighter in preventing strikes on the buses, in warehouse and supply chains, local government and the docks from merging into a national action. Graham cynically urged Labour to be more bold and place its arms around the working class. This after Labour-run Coventry council last year mounted a 4 million scabbing operation against a strike by its refuse drivers. Graham agreed a de-escalation of the dispute through ACAS, which naturally ruled in favour of the council. The union bureaucracy has presided over the sabotage of the largest strike wave in the UK since the 1980s, with the last remaining national disputes in the NHS and on the rail facing sellouts. This betrayal is now being transferred to the political arena with the attempts by Lynch, Ward, Graham et al to hand the working class over to Starmer as Labour seeks to outflank the Tories in its commitment to austerity and war. The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) opposed the propaganda of pseudo-left groups such as Socialist Party and Socialist Workers Party that a rebirth of the British labour movement was being led by the trade unions and issued the call for the formation of rank-and-file committees to open an independent path of industrial and political struggle. As has been the case with the resurgence of the class struggle internationally, the strivings by the working class to unshackle its tremendous social power has brought it into direct conflict with the bureaucratic agents of capital committed to the suppression of the class struggle and defence of the capitalist profit system. The SEP initiative has won significant support through the formation of the Postal Workers Rank-and-File Committee. But this must now be extended throughout the working class, coupled with a political break from Labour and the building of genuine socialist leadership.

The American College of Emergency Physicians in a statement called the paper outdated and said the term excited delirium should not be used by members who testify in civil or criminal cases. The group's directors voted on the matter Thursday in Philadelphia. This means if someone dies while being restrained in custody ... people cannot point to excited delirium as the reason and cannot point to ACEP's endorsement of the concept to bolster their case, said Dr. Brooks Walsh, a Connecticut emergency doctor who pushed the organization to strengthen its stance. Earlier this week, California became the first state to bar the use of excited delirium and related terms as a because of death in autopsies. The legislation, signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, also prohibits police officers from using it in reports to describe people's behavior. In March, the National Association of Medical Examiners took a stand against the term, saying it should not be listed as a because of death. Other medical groups, including the American Medical Association, had previously rejected excited delirium as a diagnosis. Critics have called it unscientific and rooted in racism. The emergency physicians' 2009 report said excited delirium's symptoms included unusual strength, pain tolerance and bizarre behavior and called the condition potentially life-threatening. The document reinforced and codified racial stereotypes, Walsh said. The 14-year-old publication has shaped police training and still figures in police custody death cases, many involving Black men who died after being restrained by police. Attorneys defending officers have cited the paper to admit testimony on excited delirium, said Joanna Naples-Mitchell, an attorney and research adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, which produced a report last year on the diagnosis and deaths in police custody. In 2021, the emergency physicians' paper was cited in the New York attorney general's report on the investigation into the death of Daniel Prude, a 41-year-old Black man. A grand jury rejected charges against police officers in that case. Excited delirium came up during the 2021 trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was later convicted in the death of George Floyd. This fall, the term resurfaced during the ongoing trials of police officers charged in the deaths of Elijah McClain in Colorado and Manuel Ellis in Washington state. Floyd, McClain and Ellis were Black men who died after being restrained by police. The emergency physicians group had distanced itself from the term previously, but it had stopped short of withdrawing its support for the 2009 paper. This is why we pushed to put out a stronger statement explicitly disavowing that paper, Naples-Mitchell said. It is a chance for ACEP to really break with the past.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Reed Wischhusen, 32, was himself shot by police officers after he charged down the stairs at his home in the village of Wick St. Lawrence in Somerset with a pistol pointed at them. Wischhusen -- who was obsessed with Dunblane gunman Thomas Hamilton and Northumberland killer Raoul Moat -- had been angered when he was denied a shotgun certificate by Avon and Somerset Police. On November 28, 2022, armed police officers arrived at the home he shared with his father after receiving intelligence, the Lidl warehouse worker was converting blank-firing pistols to fire live ammunition. When Wischhusen's house was searched, police found several weapons, as well as body armour and a deactivated hand grenade. On Friday a jury at Bristol Crown Court found Wischhusen guilty of having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. During the trial one of the firearms officers described the sheer terror he felt as Wischhusen rushed toward him and his colleagues. Two officers, identified only as P3 and L4, arrived at the house to carry out a search. As P3 tried to follow Wischhusen up the stairs he heard a shot from the bathroom and he ran downstairs, shouting Withdraw. L4, who had remained downstairs with two other officers, said, In my mind, I did a risk assessment very quickly and I withdrew my handgun and covered the stairs where I perceived the threat to be. It was really quick, and I was concerned I did not know where Reed was. There was also a degree of concern that I did not know what had happened to him, he added. L4 said: I shouted for him to come to the top of the stairs. After a short amount of time -- it was so quick -- he came to the top of the stairs as I shouted for him to do. He had handgun and pointed directly at me. He said Wischhusen still had his gun pointed at him, so he fired two shots and withdrew from the house. It happened so quickly. I withdrew toward the door at the same time. I fired a further shot, and then he dropped to the ground, he added. Mr. Rees asked: Why did you fire a third shot? L4 replied: Because he was still coming toward me, and he was still there with the handgun pointed at me. Wischhusen survived his injuries and after he was taken into custody the police found an armoury of homemade weapons including pistols, sub-machine guns, ammunition, bombs, grenades and poison. They also found a document entitled Revenge, in which Wischhusen plotted out his plan to kill ten named people against whom he bore a grudge. When he gave evidence, Wischhusen demonstrated to the jury with his fingers how he cocked his gun, put it to his head and pulled the trigger. I partially lost consciousness and I could hear 'shots fired' on the radio and sounding like someone falling down the stairs, he said. Wischhusen added: So I knew the police had drawn their guns, so I went downstairs and threatened them so they would shoot me dead and finish the job. He told the court he had bought the tools to build his own weapons after Avon and Somerset Police twice rejected his application for a shotgun certificate. I decided if I could not have a shotgun for clay pigeon shooting, then I will build myself a sub-machine gun to prove a point, Wischhusen added.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Following the October 7, 2023, surprise attack and mass kidnapping of Israeli citizens by Gaza-based Hamas militants, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) began a massive military campaign against the Palestinian enclave. Photos of IDF actions around the Gaza City seaport on October 11, 2023, have since been used as evidence that Israel used white phosphorus munitions in this heavily populated civilian area, in contravention of international norms and law. White phosphorus (WP), a solid that burns at extremely high temperatures when exposed to oxygen, is a common component of smoke-screen munitions that has also been used by many armies -- including the YOU.S. military -- as an incendiary device. When such a weapon is used over civilian populations, it is presently considered a violation of a number of international agreements or humanitarian norms due to the indiscriminate nature of its delivery, and its potential to cause extreme bodily harm. As described by the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW), WP, in addition to destroying property and infrastructure, can cause both immediate and life-long suffering when it comes into contact with human skin: White phosphorus causes severe burns, often down to the bone, that are slow to heal and likely to develop infections. If not all fragments of white phosphorus are removed, they can exacerbate wounds after treatment and reignite when exposed to oxygen. White phosphorus burns on only 10 percent of a human body are often fatal. It can also because respiratory damage and organ failure. Those who survive their initial injuries often experience a lifetime of suffering. Contractures -- the permanent tightening of muscles and other tissue -- impede mobility, while the trauma of the initial attack, painful treatments, and appearance-changing scars lead to psychological harm and social exclusion. The fires caused by white phosphorus can also destroy civilian structures and property, damage crops, and kill livestock. Furthermore, inadequate resources available to medical providers in armed conflict settings exacerbate the already challenging process of treating serious burns. A tweet from the X social media account War Monitor on October 11, 2023, for example, claimed in a viral post that a series of photos confirmed the use of phosphorus munitions on Gaza a short while ago. The photos show military action on and around the Gaza City seaport: Palestine's foreign ministry leveled the same accusation, and several outlets or social media accounts also strongly suggested that those images, and also videos, like the one below, provided evidence of WP's use: The photos in the viral tweet and related videos genuinely show military activity over the Gaza Strip on October 11, 2023. Taken by photojournalist Mohommed Abed, the photos are available to journalists in the Getty Images editorial library and have been widely published. Videos showing the same explosion from a different perspective also confirm the timing and context of the explosions: On October 12, 2023, the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) announced its view that WP was used by the IDF on October 10-11 in three areas, including the seaport. Israel has not commented on the matter. Asked for comment by Reuters, a spokesperson for the IDF said it was currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza. On December 27, 2008, Israel launched a 22-day military operation on the Gaza Strip in response to rockets fired from the enclave. In the final days of that operation, Israel was accused of using white phosphorus weapons in proximity to civilian centers, including the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and a nearby hospital. At first, Israel denied its use. In a scathing 74-page report issued in 2009, HRW disputed these denials. As reported by The Guardian in January 2009, Israel later admitted WP could, in fact, have been improperly used: Israel has admitted - after mounting pressure - that its troops may have used white phosphorus shells in contravention of international law, during its three-week offensive in the Gaza Strip. One of the places most seriously affected by the use of white phosphorus was the main UN compound in Gaza City, which was hit by three shells on 15 January. The same munition was used in a strike on the al-Quds hospital in Gaza City the same day. Under review by Colonel Shai Alkalai is the use of white phosphorus by a reserve paratroop brigade in northern Israel. According to army sources the brigade fired up to 20 phosphorus shells in a heavily built-up area around the Gaza township of Beit Lahiya, one of the worst hit areas of Gaza. In that 2009 case, as HRW documented, American-made WP shells fired from 155mm-caliber Howitzer guns burst in the air above their target, splintering, by design, into 116 solid shards of burning, white phosphorus that brought both smoke and flame to the ground below: As Middle East Eye reported shortly after images of explosions were posted in 2023, sources on the ground reported seeing scenes consistent with past Israeli white phosphorus use in Gaza, including during the 2008 conflict. Indeed, a comparison of the air-blast explosions involved in the 2008-09 offensive and in October 2023 show what appear to be remarkably similar effects: White phosphorus used over Gaza on January 15, 2009 (Left); Explosions over Gaza on October 11, 2023 (Right) This similarity alone does not confirm the use of white phosphorus munitions in the 2023 conflict, because Israel has other weapons that create smoke screens without WP. In 2013, in large part due to outrage over its use in the 2008-09 conflict, the IDF committed to removing phosphorus munitions from its arsenal. As described by HRW, however, Israel's commitment to not using WP over populated areas came with vague loopholes and no substantive commitments: In 2013, in response to a petition before Israel's High Court of Justice regarding the Gaza attacks, the Israeli military claimed that it would no longer use white phosphorus in populated areas except in two narrow situations that it revealed only to the justices. In the court's ruling, Justice Edna Arbel explained that the conditions would render use of white phosphorous an extreme exception in highly particular circumstances. Although this pledge to the court did not represent an official change in policy, Justice Arbel called on the Israeli military to conduct a thorough and comprehensive examination and adopt a permanent military directive. As reported by The Associated Press in 2013, Israel pledged to transition to smoke munitions that were not incendiary: Israel's army said ... that it would soon halt its use of white phosphorus shells after years of international criticism for using the incendiary munitions in crowded Palestinian areas. The army said in a statement that it would replace white phosphorus shells with ones based entirely on gas. That replacement gas was hexachloroethane (HC). The Israel-based weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems, which is the exclusive munitions provider to the IDF, developed an improved 155mm-caliber HC she will as a replacement for the IDF's WP stockpile. In a 2019 Elbit presentation to the National Defense Industrial Association, the company described that product, the M150, as a replacement for Israel's previous WP munitions. This weapon releases five canisters of HC gas from a 155mm caliber she will designed, like the WP munitions, to air-blast above the target region: There is evidence that Israel has previously put the M150 HC munitions into use. The M150 was alleged, as an example, to have been used by the IDF preceding a 2021 Israeli strike on an agrochemical warehouse, the Khudair Warehouse, in the Gaza Strip. In that case, the literal canisters from the M150 were found on the ground. A video alleged by the investigative outlet Forensic Architecture to show an M150 munition used during that operation clearly shows 5 smoke trails -- one for each canister -- following an airburst: (Forensic Design) Those visuals are distinct from the videos and images alleged to show the use of WP in Gaza in October 2023, which show over 100 individual streams of smoke following an airburst. A close look at the burst of one of these munitions, from a photo taken on October 11 from the same area, shows what appears to be burning shards of solids causing the trails through the air: On October 11, Human Rights Watch interviewed by phone two people from the al-Mina area in Gaza City, who described observing strikes consistent with the use of white phosphorus. One was in the street at the time, while the other was in a nearby office building. Both described ongoing airstrikes before seeing explosions in the sky followed by what they described as white lines going earthward. ... Both said that the smell was stifling. The person who was in his office said that the smell was so strong that he went toward the window to see what was happening and then filmed the strike. Human Rights Watch reviewed the video and verified that it was taken in Gaza City's port and identified that the munitions used in the strike were airburst 155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles. Other videos posted to social media and verified by Human Rights Watch show the same location. Dense white smoke and a garlic smell are characteristics of white phosphorus. Israel is not a party to any treaty that bans use of WP in populated areas, but such a use is -- at the very least -- in violation of international norms when it comes to modern warfare, as explained by HRW: When used as a weapon, munitions with white phosphorus are considered incendiary weapons. Although incendiary weapons are not explicitly banned by international humanitarian law, customary international humanitarian law requires states to take all feasible precautions to avoid the harm to civilians caused by those weapons. In addition, incendiary weapons are governed by Protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Palestine and Lebanon have joined Protocol III, while Israel has not ratified the protocol. Protocol III prohibits the use of airdropped incendiary weapons in concentrations of civilians, but it has ... significant loopholes. While all airburst smoke screens created by the IDF forces are not, de facto, the result of WP munitions, the HC munitions used to create smoke screens without WP are inconsistent with the photos and videos from Gaza City's seaport on Oct 11, 2023. Though these videos and photos may not be confirmation of the use of white phosphorus munitions over populated areas by Israel, they are strong evidence in support of that conclusion.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. The Korean Central News Agency said Kim made the comments during a two-day session of the country's rubber-stamp parliament, which amended the constitution to include his policy of expanding the country's nuclear weapons program. In Russia, Kim deepened comradely fellowship and friendly ties with Putin, North Korean state media reported. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The two leaders discussed he latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department. (Copyright (c) 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The IEA will continue to monitor the oil market closely and, as ever, stands ready to act if necessary to ensure markets remain adequately supplied, the IEA said in its latest monthly oil market report. ...While the prospect that oil supply flows will be impacted currently remains limited, the deadly strikes prompted traders to price in a higher geopolitical risk premium. Market watchers have speculated that oil supplies from Iran could be hit if the US tightens sanctions on Tehran over its backing of the Hamas and Hizbollah militants currently in conflict with Israel. The Paris-based energy watchdog has a key role in coordinating the release of emergency oil stocks with each IEA member country obligated to hold oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports and to be ready to collectively respond to severe supply disruptions affecting the global oil market. The IEA left its forecast for world oil supply in 2023 largely unchanged on the month at a record 101.6 million bd, adding that -- barring any unforeseen disruptions -- it is expected to average around 101.3 million bd in the fourth quarter of the year. Non-OPEC is still expected to dominate the projected annual supply gains this year of 1.5 million bd in 2023, it said. In 2024, the IEA also confirmed its previous estimate of 103.3 million bd. Demand destruction On demand, the IEA cut its 2024 global estimate by 76,000 bd from its previous forecasts to 102.7 million bd, as higher prices and a shift to working from home in key consuming countries such as the US have helped to soften the demand outlook. Citing a recent study from European think tank EconPol, the IEA said the rise of post-pandemic working from home means 500,000 bd of fuel use is being avoided in the US alone. The IEA said 2023 will likely be the last year of US demand growth before a decline of 220,000 bd sets in next year, when US gasoline consumption is forecast to decrease by 180,000 bd amid structural efficiency gains and a harsher economic climate. Demand destruction has hit emerging markets even harder, the IEA said, as currency effects and the removal of subsidies amplify a rise in fuel prices. There has been some evidence of large-scale demand destruction, especially in lower-income countries, like Nigeria, Pakistan and Egypt, and signs of accelerating declines within some OECD markets including the United States. These have been particularly centered on gasoline, with Nigeria seeing the latest and most abrupt response to sharply higher prices, the IEA said. Nevertheless, global oil demand is forecast to continue its strong growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, the IEA said, underpinning an annual increase of 2.3 million bd to 101.9 million bd for 2023 as a whole. China and non-OECD economies account for 77 and 97 of the increase, respectively. Oil demand growth continues to be led by jet fuelkerosene and petrochemical feedstocks. Next year, global oil demand is still expected to decelerate to 880,000 bd, as a harsher economic climate and continued progress in energy efficiency weigh on oil consumption, the IEA said. Stocks shrinking On stocks, the IEA said global observed oil inventories shrank by 63.9 million barrels in August to a 10-month low, led by a massive 102.3-million-barrel draw in crude oil stocks. Oil on water declined by 40.6 million barrels, while OECD and non-OECD stocks fell by 3.5 million barrels and 19.7 million barrels, respectively. OECD industry stocks fell counter-seasonally by 6.5 million barrels in August to 2.816 billion barrels, the IEA said, some 105.3 million barrels below the five-year average. The IEA also said preliminary data shows that on-land inventories continued to draw in September, mainly in non-OECD countries, while oil on water rebounded as exports recovered. Voluntary output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia are expected to keep the oil market in deficit as OPEC could pump 1.3 million bd below the call on its crude in the fourth quarter, the IEA said. If extra cuts are unwound in January, the balance could shift to surplus, which would go some way to help replenish depleted inventories, the IEA said.

In the aftermath of Hamas' surprise attack across Israel's southern border on October 7, Israel has carried out a relentless bombardment of Gaza to try to take out Hamas' weapons stockpiles and its vast tunnel system. But Israeli ground forces likely will be needed to clear out the tunnel network known as Gaza's Metro, according to former YOU.S. officials and military officers. Clearly, they want to put as many of these out of commission as possible, said Matthew Levitt, a counterterrorism expert and former YOU.S. senior national security official. The tunnels are a critical military objective for Israel as it seeks to degrade Hamas' armed forces and dismantle the militants' infrastructure, said Levitt, now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank. Since the Hamas attack on Israel, the Biden administration said it is providing Israel with kits to convert unguided or dumb bombs into precision-guided munitions as well as small diameter bombs (SDBs) that experts say are effective weapons against underground targets. The weapons are supposed to enable Israel to target Hamas militants while minimizing harm to civilians, experts said, though humanitarian organizations have expressed concern over the plight of Gaza's civilian population given the intensity of the Israeli air raids. In May, the administration gave the green light for the sale of 735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel. The Israeli military also may also opt to use YOU.S.-made bunker buster GBU-28 bombs that it previously acquired. Those munitions are designed to penetrate hardened targets deep underground, though the bombs leave massive craters and could inflict severe civilian casualties. The YOU.S. is supporting the Israeli effort to find hostages in Gaza's extensive tunnel system, including trying to determine if Hamas is trying to sneak hostages out of Gaza via the tunnels, according to a YOU.S. official. As Israel conducts airstrikes they are cognizant of where tunnels are and whether civilians could be inside, the official said. Although Israel has cutting edge technology to detect Hamas' tunnels, the underground network will present serious challenges for the Israel Defense Forces, according to Bradley Bowman, senior director of the center on military and political power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank. A significant number of Hamas terrorists will likely be able to survive air strikes by hiding in the tunnels below Gaza. It is probably safe to assume that Hamas has stocked those tunnels with significant quantities of food, water, weapons, and ammunition, said Bowman, a former YOU.S. Army officer and national security adviser to members of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. For more than a decade, the tunnels in Gaza have proved a crucial tool in the Hamas arsenal, enabling the militants to frustrate the powerful Israeli military and live to fight another day. Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, once referred to the tunnels as part of a new strategy in confronting the occupation and in the conflict with the enemy from underground and from above the ground. Tunnels dug in Gaza were originally used for smuggling goods in and out of Egypt to circumvent an Israeli blockade. But Palestinian militants built up the tunnels to move rockets and rocket launchers, shield militants from detection by Israeli satellites and aircraft and to stage attacks into Israeli territory. The vast underground system includes storage rooms, electrical generators, command centers and supplies for Hamas' fighters, according to the Israeli military. The network has dozens of access points located throughout Gaza, and many of the tunnel entrances are next to civilian residences, the IDF says. Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Qassam Brigades the military wing of Hamas, is believed to be the mastermind behind the tunnel system, according to Israeli media reports. Dating back to 2006, Hamas militants have dug tunnels inside Israeli territory and staged a series of surprise attacks. As a result, Israel built a specially designed 40-mile underground concrete barrier to try to detect tunnel construction in Gaza. The barrier helped Israel uncover a tunnel in 2020 before Hamas could use the passage to mount an attack inside Israel, according to the IDF. During a series of military operations in Gaza, Israeli forces have tried to wipe out the tunnel system, but Hamas has rebuilt the tunnels in each case. Hamas also has a tunnel network linking Gaza to neighboring Egypt, which is used to smuggle both commercial goods and weapons. Some of the tunnels are 18 meters (about 20 yards) below ground, NBC News has previously reported. Some former YOU.S. officials say Hamas may choose to move some of the hostages they seized in last Saturday's attack out of Gaza through the tunnels to Egypt.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Passenger railroads nationwide will now be required to install video recorders inside their locomotives, but the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said the new rule is flawed because it excludes freight trains like the one that derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio, in February 2023. The NTSB made its recommendation to add cameras in locomotives in 2010 after it investigated the deadly 2008 collision between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train. JOSH FUNK Associated Press Passenger railroads nationwide will now be required to install video recorders inside their locomotives, but the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday the new rule is flawed because it excludes freight trains like the one that derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio earlier this year. The Federal Railroad Administration did not respond directly to the criticism of the rule requiring cameras showing both the train crew's actions and a view from the front of passenger trains. FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said freight railroads were not addressed because a 2015 law Congress passed only required regulators to establish a rule for passenger railroads. But many freight railroads, including all the biggest ones that handle a majority of shipments nationwide, have installed cameras voluntarily, starting with outward-facing cameras and later adding ones showing the crews' actions.

A spokeswoman for the American Short Line and Railroad Association said only a few short-line railroads have them and most of those are only outward-facing cameras. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement that the FRA's belief that the cost 'could outweigh the safety benefits' is an affront to every community that is experienced a freight or freight-passenger rail disaster. The Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February did have cameras, but Homendy said that because there are no federal standards for those cameras, investigators have only 20 minutes of footage from before that derailment. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio Though many in the freight rail industry have opted to install recorders voluntarily, there is absolutely no standard for the number of hours of data they must preserve after an accident, Homendy said. East Palestine is a striking example: instead of having 12 hours' worth of in-cab video, as we have recommended, our investigators only have access to a 20-minute recording -- not nearly enough to help us or the FRA identify critical safety improvements needed to prevent similar accidents from reoccurring. Homendy said the new rule also fails to require audio recordings inside the cabs of locomotives. The NTSB made its recommendation to add cameras in locomotives in 2010 after it investigated the deadly 2008 collision between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California. That crash killed 25 people, including the Metrolink engineer, and injured more than 100. But the NTSB said such cameras would have been useful in dozens of other crashes because they can help determine what caused them, particularly when the train crew was killed or cannot remember key details. Investigators determined that the Metrolink engineer was sending and receiving text messages on his cellphone before the crash, and he ran a red signal light before slamming into the Union Pacific freight train. Congress responded to that Chatsworth collision by requiring railroads to develop and install an automatic braking system that might have prevented it -- something that took more than a decade and roughly 15 billion to complete. And regulators banned cellphone use by train operators. Later, lawmakers also required regulators in the 2015 law to look at requiring locomotive video recorders for passenger trains. Amtrak pledged in 2015 to install cameras on its trains after a crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured about 200. This new rule will require cameras on all intercity commuter and passenger trains as well. While video recorders cannot directly prevent accidents, they help maintain a higher standard of safety, said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. In addition, these devices play a vital role in post-accident investigations, providing valuable evidence that helps us understand the circumstances leading to the accident and take appropriate action to prevent similar accidents in the future.

Its claims are based on an image released Friday showing a shipment from an ammunition depot in North Korea, or DPRK, that was loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by rail to a depot along Russia's southwestern border. The delivery took place between September 7 and October 1, the YOU.S. says. 'We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians, and further Russia's illegitimate war,' National Security Council Director of Strategic Communications John Kirby said Friday. This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows increased activity at the Tumangang Rail Facility in North Korea, on October 5, 2023. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) Kirby has disclosed that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime, Kirby warned. He noted that Washington is in lockstep with allies and partners to counter arms deals between Russia and North Korea by sanctioning individuals and entities working to facilitate such arms deals. We will not allow the DPRK to aid Russia's war machine in secret, and the world should know about the support that Russia may again provide the DPRK in return, Kirby said. Targeting Odesa Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, during a visit to the Black Sea port of Odesa, pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defenses and to increase the security of a 'humanitarian corridor' for grain exports. Zelenskyy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black Sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are a vital source of revenue for Ukraine's defense spending following Russia's invasion last year.

(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) 'We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole,' Zelenskyy said. The Odesa region has become a frequent target of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed upwards of 300,000 tons of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels had been already loaded with grain for exports and used a new 'humanitarian' grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian air strikes during the winter, Rutte said on Friday. 'This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So, the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric airstrikes,' Rutte said after a meeting with Zelenskyy in Odesa. Rutte also said the Netherlands would help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Funding the effort European Union leaders meeting later in October will demand 'decisive progress' on using Russian assets frozen by sanctions to help Ukraine, according to their draft statement, addressing a matter that has been stuck for months. The United States and Britain last month showed support for an EU plan to tax windfall profits generated by frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine as Kyiv battles a full-scale Russian invasion begun in February 2022. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven, or G7, industrialized countries meeting in Morocco on Thursday estimated 280 billion worth of such assets had been frozen. They said they expected more work in the coming months to find legally sound ways of using them to aid Ukraine.

(Stefan RousseauPool via Reuters) Belgium, not a member of the G7 group, where most frozen Russian central bank assets are held, said it expects to collect 2.4 billion in taxes on the assets and use them to help Ukraine's reconstruction process, a spokesperson for Belgium's prime minister said Wednesday. Britain is planning to increase its military presence in northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, or JEF, defense cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. JEF, a defense cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to 'outside activity,' stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. 'This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent,' Sunak said in a statement.

The employees were each indicted separately on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They were suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, Sheriff Gregory Tony said, calling it a standard procedure. Further disciplinary action is expected. I am not going to sugarcoat or dance around this, at the end of the day they will be gone, Tony said Thursday at a joint news conference with YOU.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida. If they are being criminally charged, there is no place for them in this organization, the sheriff continued. How can we have anyone out here wearing a badge that is stealing from the American people? The employees are accused of providing fraudulent information in order to obtain loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or EIDL, program, Lapointe's office said in a news release. The loans were given to business owners struggling during the pandemic. Lapointe's office said together they collected 495,171 in assistance and used the money to unjustly enrich themselves. The YOU.S. Attorney's Office and our law enforcement partners will continue to uncover the fraud schemes and hold anyone involved accountable -- regardless of an individual's role in the community, Lapointe said in a statement. No matter the amount, we will not allow limited federal tax dollars, which were intended to provide a lifeline to small businesses as they struggled to stay afloat during the economically devastating pandemic lockdown, to be swindled by those who were employed in a position of trust and cast aside their duty to uphold and abide by the law. The scheme was uncovered after the sheriff's office's Public Corruption Unit received a tip from an employee that several workers may have committed PPP loan fraud, Tony said. He then instructed the unit to investigate the agency's roughly 5,500 employees, he said at the news conference. The accused workers include eight from the Department of Law Enforcement, including one sergeant, eight detention deputies and one sergeant from the Department of Detention, Sheriff Tony said, according to the sheriff.

The attack was being investigated as potential terrorism amid soaring global tensions over the war between Israel and Hamas. It also happened almost three years after another teacher, Samuel Paty. was beheaded by a radicalized Chechen near a Paris area school. French anti-terror prosecutors were leading the investigation into the stabbings at the Gambetta-Carnot school, which enrolls students ages 11-18 and is located in the city of Arras, some 115 miles north of Paris. President Emmanuel Macron, who visited the school hours after the attack, said the victim stepped in and probably saved many lives. Macron also said that police thwarted an attempted attack in another French region after the teacher's fatal stabbing. The president did not provide details, but police said a man armed with a knife was arrested coming out of a prayer hall in the Yvelines region west of Paris. The man's motives were not immediately clear, police said. The suspected assailant in Arras was arrested. The National Police force identified him as a Russian national of Chechen origin who was born in 2003. The French intelligence services told The Associated Press the man had been closely watched since the summer with tails and telephone surveillance and was stopped as recently as Thursday for a police check that found no wrongdoing. Sliman Hamzi, a police officer who was one of the first on the scene said the suspected attacker, a former student at the school, shouted Allahu akbar, or God is great in Arabic. Hamzi said he was alerted by another officer, rushed to the school and saw a male victim lying on the ground outside the school and the attacker being taken away. Colleagues arrived quickly but unfortunately could not save the victim, Hamzi said. He said the victim had his throat slit. I am extremely shocked by what I saw, the officer said. It was a horrible thing to see this poor man who was killed on the job by a lunatic. Police said two other men, a second teacher and a security guard, were in critical condition. Macron traveled to Arras along with the interior and education ministers. Macron stopped for a moment before the blanket-covered body of the teacher, which was in the parking lot in front of the school. A puddle of blood was visible as forensic experts worked around the body. Macron then went to see students from the school in an adjacent building. School attacks are rare in France, and the government asked authorities to heighten vigilance at all schools across the country. Julie Duhamel, an official with the Unsa teachers' union in the Pas-de-Calais region that includes Arras, told Franceinfo that teachers had noted the suspect's radicalization a few years ago. The suspected assailant's telephone conversations in recent days gave no indication of an impending attack, leading intelligence officers to conclude that the assailant decided suddenly on Friday to act, intelligence services told the AP. The suspect's brother was arrested in the summer of 2019 by the DGSI -- France's counter-terrorism intelligence service -- on suspicion of being involved in planning of attack that was thwarted and is in jail, French intelligence said. Police said another brother was taken into custody for questioning on Friday. Hundreds of police deployed around the school and nearby neighborhoods, including heavily armed units, and barricaded a wide perimeter around the school after the attack. Friday's attack had echoes of Paty's slaying on Oct 16, 2020 -- also a Friday -- by an 18-year-old who had become radicalized. Like the suspect in Friday's stabbings, the attacker had a Chechen background. Martin Doussau, a philosophy teacher at Gambetta-Carnot, said the assailant was armed with two knives and appeared to be hunting specifically for a history teacher. Paty taught history and geography. I was chased by the attacker, who ... asked me if I teach history. (He said), 'Are you a history teacher, are you a history teacher?' said Doussau, who recounted how he barricaded himself behind a door until police used a stun gun to subdue the attacker. When he turned around and asked me if I am a history teacher, I immediately thought of Samuel Paty, Doussau told reporters. Prosecutors said they were considering charges of terror-related murder and attempted murder against the suspect. The attack came amid heightened tensions around the world over Hamas' attack on southern Israel and Israel's blistering military response, which have killed hundreds of civilians on both sides. France is estimated to have the world's third-largest Jewish population after Israel and the YOU.S., as well as the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. French Interior Minister Grald Darmanin on Thursday ordered local authorities to ban all pro-Palestinian demonstrations amid a rise in antisemitic acts since last Saturday's attack by Hamas militants and the Israeli military's subsequent bombardment and siege of Gaza. France's National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, held a minute of silence for the victims at the opening of its Friday session. Macron said the school in Arras would reopen as soon as Saturday morning. The choice has been made not to give in to terror, he said. We must not let anything divide us, and we must remember that schools and the transmission of knowledge are at the heart of this fight against ignorance.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Mahmud Hams  AFP via Getty Images file Videos published online that Hamas says are its terrorists committing violent acts during the recent attack on Israel have spread across the app X and the messaging app Telegram, with many remaining online for hours and sometimes days. On X, some videos created by Hamas and the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, have been shared by some verified accounts and have accrued millions of views, according to a review by NBC News. Hamas videos were also viewable on Telegram, which is based in Dubai and has few rules about the content that users post. Users who have posted the videos on X often say they are reposting official Hamas content from the group's attack on Israel. On Telegram, videos from the official Qassam Brigades account are labeled as first-person footage from terrorists who were part of the attack. When asked for comment, X sent an automated email saying Busy now, please check back later. Telegram did not respond. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said Friday in a post on the app that the company removes millions of obviously harmful content from our public platform, but that it also sees some value and responsibility in being an avenue for war-related content even if some of it is produced by terrorist organizations. Unlike other apps that algorithmically promote shocking content to unsuspecting people, on Telegram, users receive only the content to which they specifically subscribed, he added. As such, it is unlikely that Telegram channels can be used to significantly amplify propaganda. Instead, they serve as a unique source of first-hand information for researchers, journalists, and fact-checkers. NBC News was unable to find such overt violent, branded videos on other major tech platforms, though footage from the war remains pervasive. Adam Hadley, executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a nonprofit group that helps tech platforms moderate branded terrorism content from groups officially designated as terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union, said he was disappointed in the tech companies' responses. What we have found over the past week is that a number of platforms have done nothing, he said. And we are talking about officially branded material. Platforms have for many years had special rules regarding content produced by terrorist organizations. About a decade ago, tech companies began to more aggressively moderate their platforms after the Islamic State terrorist group began publishing violent propaganda videos. Under the leadership of Elon Musk, who bought X last year, the company has cut back on its moderation teams that policed the platform for content that violated its policies. The company also changed the definition of a verified user from a person the company has authenticated to a person who pays a monthly fee for a premium subscription. Those users get priority placement in other users' feeds and in search results, and can monetize their accounts if they reach enough people. The nonprofit Tech Transparency Project, which aims to create accountability for tech companies, released a report Thursday highlighting Hamas content on X. It found four verified accounts that have shared branded Hamas content purportedly from the invasion. NBC News verified that those videos are all still visible on X. That is particularly concerning with content like this because it is essentially paying to get algorithmically promoted Hamas videos ranked higher in search, said Katie Paul, the organization's director. The European Commission, the enforcement arm of the E.YOU., has warned X that allowing terrorism videos to proliferate on major websites runs afoul of the bloc's regulations. X CEO Linda Yaccarino told the E.YOU. in an open letter Wednesday that we have taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content. Shortly after the news broke about the Hamas attack, X assembled a leadership group to assess the situation. In crisis situations, X's unique purpose to serve the public conversation; access and share information, raise awareness about the situations they are in and on the ground, and openly and freely exchange on issues becomes all the more critical, she wrote. The Commission announced Thursday that it was escalating its inquiry into X and could impose fines. Terrorist and extremist content have also long proliferated on Telegram. The app is often the first place that footage from terrorist acts and war zones is uploaded before spreading to other sites like X. The Qassam Brigades maintains an active Telegram channel with more than 600,000 subscribers. Videos that purport to be from the invasion over the weekend, including footage of killed and captured Israelis, are live on the channel. Yasmin Green, CEO of Jigsaw, a Google-owned organization that designs tech programs to counter societal platforms -- including ones to automatically flag content from particular terrorist groups -- said she worried the Hamas videos could inspire further acts of violence. They echo how ISIS used videos of violence for recruitment almost a decade also, she said. That group also primarily used Telegram and Twitter. We are about to witness a phenomenal wave of radicalization, she said. The incitement to violence is really concerning. I will not be surprised when I see it in the Hamas case, because I already learned the lesson from the ISIS case that egregious violence can be a recruitment asset for terrorist groups.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Our information indicates that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on a call. It is unclear exactly how much materiel and munitions each container holds, but photos released Friday indicate the vessels are full-sized shipping containers of the type often seen on rail cars or cargo ships. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, added Kirby, using the official acronym for North Korea. US intelligence indicated some of the equipment began its journey in the North Korean port of Najin on Sept. 7 and arrived in the Russian coastal city of Dunay five days later. It was then transported by train across Russia before arriving at an ammunition depot near Tikhorestsk -- fewer than 300 miles east of the Crimean Peninsula -- on October 1. These arms transfers directly violate a series of UN Security Council resolutions, which is why we will continue to aggressively raise these arms deals at the UN alongside with our allies and partners, Kirby said. The burgeoning alliance among US adversaries is a worry for the Biden administration, with Kirby suggesting the North Korean assistance may be part of a quid pro quo. We also are increasingly concerned about Russian assistance to the DPRK in return for support, Kirby said. We assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic-missile production equipment or other materials and other advanced technologies. US intelligence assets are monitoring closely whether Moscow will provide Pyongyang with these materials, the NSC spokesman said. We have already observed that Russian ships are offloading containers in the DPRK, which may constitute the initial deliveries of material from Russia, Kirby said. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines both regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime. We will keep working to identify, expose and counter Russia's attempts to acquire military equipment from the DPRK and any state that is prepared to support its war on Ukraine.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Even these low levels will probably increase in the next couple of weeks, said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team. That is typical for flu seasons, which tend to ramp up by December and peak in February. Budd said that the agency is not detecting the unusually early rise in flu activity that occurred last year, when kids and teenagers were hit especially hard. Most of the flu cases reported so far this season are influenza type A, specifically the H1N1 strain. A CDC report released Thursday found that children were disproportionately impacted by the flu last year. One of the study's authors, Danielle Iuliano, also a senior research epidemiologist at the CDC, said that the numbers of flu-related pediatric doctors' visits and hospitalizations were higher during the 2022-23 flu season than in previous years. Nearly all of those cases were flu type A, mostly H3N2. Just under 20 were classified as H1N1. Given what we saw last year, Iuliano said, vaccinating kids is really important to prevent them from getting sick, prevent them from being hospitalized and having the most severe outcomes. Doctors recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu shot, and say that now is the time to make that appointment. I tell my patients to get vaccinated by Halloween, said Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic. It takes at least two weeks after getting the shot to make antibodies for the maximum possible protection. We want to make sure everybody is protected before the holiday season, and that starts with Thanksgiving, Englund said. Three bugs are likely to circulate this winter: flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). There are early signs that those viruses are already spreading, though at relatively low levels, according to WastewaterSCAN. The group receives data from wastewater collection sites in 36 states three times a week, looking for evidence of viruses she would in sewage. We have started to see some increases in the rate at which we are detecting flu across the country as well as RSV, said Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. A late summer uptick in Covid seems to have peaked, Wolfe said. But those levels are still quite a bit higher on average right now than they were in the middle of the summer, Wolfe said. Still, doctors urge people to do what they can to keep viral activity down as the YOU.S. heads into cold and flu season -- including masking in some cases. Updated Covid shots and a new vaccine protecting pregnant women and older adults against RSV are available. In anticipation of increases of Covid, RSV and the flu, the Cleveland Clinic will begin requesting that everyone visiting hospitalized patients wear a mask starting next week. It is not a mandate, however. People come here to get better, and not necessarily to get exposed to something new, Englund said. They certainly do not need to be getting sicker from a visitor or a caregiver who might have any of these respiratory viruses.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a YOU.S. plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border. The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments had been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken and Kuleba discussed the latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Tim Scott has let rip with a series of attacks against President Joe Biden and some of his Republican presidential opponents this week, a sharp turn from his typical campaign posture in the wake of Hamas' terrorist attacks in Israel. Scott's most aggressive attacks have been reserved for Democrats, a common target for him -- but usually at a different level. Scott accused Biden of having blood on his hands and suggested the president was complicit in the Hamas assault. His weakness invited the attack, his cash giveaways to Iran helped fund terrorism, Scott said during a speech Tuesday at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., referring to the administration's agreeing to unfreeze 6 billion in Iranian oil money this year as part of an exchange for American prisoners. Iran had not yet been able to access any of the money, which is in a monitored account and was restricted for humanitarian use, and the YOU.S. and Qatar agreed in the wake of Hamas' attacks in Israel to re-freeze the funds, NBC News reported Thursday. Christale Spain, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said in a statement to NBC News that Scott is employing harsh rhetoric to distract from his own inexperience. While President Biden is supporting our allies and leading on the world stage in the wake of the horrific attack on Israel, Tim Scott is desperately trying to distract from his lack of foreign policy creds and failure to deliver for the thousands of American service members at South Carolina's eight military bases and across the world, Spain said. In his speech Tuesday, Scott said: We need a president who is loyal to our allies, yet lethal to our adversaries because weakness has never purchased peace. Being passive is a provocation. Scott has also blown up at far-left Democrats, who he said have become incredibly hostile to the state of Israel. He called out each congressional member of the progressive Squad by name in his speech and called for any Democrat affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America to be expelled from Congress. It is a far cry from Scott's recent answer to a question in Mason City, Iowa, from a voter who wondered if his perception as a really nice guy would weaken America on the global stage. I am a nice guy, Scott said in response. I will say though, that I am not an angry guy. I think sometimes we confuse anger with strength. The South Carolina senator has aimed to distinguish himself from other 2024 candidates and emerge as a leader on Israel, highlighting his current work on both the Senate foreign relations and banking committees, and past work on the Armed Services committee. Scott has said he plans to introduce legislation that would refreeze Iranian assets currently being held in Qatar, and called for the Senate Banking Committee to hold a hearing with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and for an investigation into the release of the 6 billion to Iran -- all of which highlight his ability as the only member of Congress in the GOP primary field to legislatively respond to the attack. In a field of folks like this, he is the one that has the experience and the knowledge to lead right now, show strength, and actually deliver, senior campaign spokesman Nathan Brand told NBC News. But Scott's messaging in recent days has gone beyond highlighting his foreign policy chops. Scott's combative rhetoric has cast Biden as passive -- reframing a criticism Scott himself has faced. Hamas, attacking Israel, is undeniably the personification of evil. People want to call it a conflict, people want to call it a war, people want to call it good people on both sides. Hogwash. This is an act of evil, Scott said Monday at a gathering of faith leaders in South Carolina organized by his campaign. Scott offered a prayer to the audience of churchgoers that strayed from the often optimistic tone of his scripture-laced speeches on the campaign trail, praying not just for peace in Israel, but also for the full force of God's wrath. I pray for the Romans 13:4, Lord, Scott said. That you establish a government and make ministers within the government for justice and for wrath. Give them swords. Scott's angrier tone has honed in on Republicans, too. Scott on Thursday called former President Donald Trump just wrong for comments Trump made that were critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We cannot extend a single message to any of the enemies of Israel, that anyone in leadership stands against, or in opposition to, or questions the leadership of, the prime minister, Scott told reporters in Newton, Iowa. In his speech at the Hudson Institute, Scott popped off at both Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, both GOP primary rivals. Vivek Ramaswamy has said that the definition of success is reducing America's support for Israel, Scott said. Governor DeSantis once dismissed Russia's invasion of Ukraine as just a territorial dispute. The last thing we need is a Joe Biden Republican Party wing on foreign policy. Scott has acknowledged his shift in tone in the days after the attack. I am positive, Scott said at the Monday gathering of faith leaders. I am also positive that God is God of love and justice. And sometimes if you want to prevent war, you want to prevent the loss of lives, you have to have the kind of response to it that tells the adversary, never again, and not on my watch.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Human Rights Watch said that videos recorded in Lebanon and Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday showed airdropped white phosphorus artillery rounds -- an assessment that was vehemently denied by Israeli officials. The group said that its analysis was corroborated through two interviews with witnesses on the ground who described a distinctive garlic-like smell that is a signature of white phosphorus. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, The current accusation made against the IDF regarding the use of white phosphorus in Gaza is unequivocally false. The IDF has not deployed the use of such munitions. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not respond to a request for comment. NBC News, which did not have reporters present when the strikes occurred in Gaza and Lebanon, has not been able to independently verify Human Rights Watch claims. White phosphorus munitions can potentially because burns and irritation, liver, kidney, heart, lung, or bone damage, and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. International law allows for certain uses of white phosphorus, such as creating smoke screens or generating light, but human rights groups say that the deployment of white phosphorus in areas where it could harm civilians or via airdrop is prohibited by international human rights laws. NBC News has not confirmed if any civilians were in the areas where white phosphorus was allegedly used. Gaza is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Israel has not signed and is not bound by the United Nations convention on the use of white phosphorus. Human Rights Watch says that it previously documented the use of white phosphorus by Israel in military conflict in 2009, a claim that was also echoed by the International Red Cross. Israel said in 2013 it would no longer use white phosphorus except in limited circumstances, according to Human Rights Watch. The munitions used this week in Gaza and Lebanon, the group said, were airburst 155 mm artillery projectiles, which can shower large areas with white phosphorus. The use of white phosphorus in densely populated areas of Gaza violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life, Human Rights Watch said in its report. In an email, Brian Castner, the weapons investigator for Amnesty International's crisis team, agreed with Human Rights Watch's assessment that the strikes they cited involved the apparent uses of white phosphorus. Castner added that Amnesty International has been conducting its own investigation into Israel's alleged use of white phosphorus, saying, We have verified that Israeli artillery forces striking Gaza are equipped with M825 and M825A1 155mm white phosphorus projectiles. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights told NBC News it was looking into the claims. In a Zoom interview, Palestinian surgeon Sara Al Saqqa, who works at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, said she had seen injuries this week that appeared consistent with white phosphorus wounds. There is certain types of weapons, the white phosphorus war crime injuries that is not even humanitarian to be used in wars. It is not allowed for anyone to use it. I have been seeing patients being injured with these type of injuries, Al Saqqa told NBC News. Those small shrapnels that just burn every single millimeter of their bodies, and like just cutting all the pieces of the depth of the bodies to parts, she added. Amhad Hasaballah, a Getty photojournalist, told NBC News that he photographed a barrage of strikes that hit Gaza City on October 11 that he believed to include white phosphorus smoke. Hasaballah has been photographing the region since 2015 and has previously won awards for his coverage of Israeli airstrikes. The photographs are now published and labeled online as depicting white phosphorus. The claim that white phosphorus was being used by Israel in this week's conflict has been circulating for several days online. On October 10, the official X account of the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates wrote, Israeli warplanes and artillery use internationally prohibitedwhitephosphorus, destroying AlKarama neighborhood in the northwest of Gaza City with a continuous series of airstrikes. The report comes as Israel appears to be preparing a ground assault on Gaza, warning more than 1 million people to leave the north of the densely populated enclave, which is roughly the size of Washington, D.C. At least 1,300 people have been killed in Israel since Hamas staged a series of surprise attacks on Saturday, the country's military has said. Nearly 1,800 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry, as Israel continues to bombard the area.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Luton Airport said Terminal Car Park 2 cannot be accessed safely so it is unable to confirm the condition of any individual vehicle at this time. Up to 1,500 vehicles remain in the car park, with the debris of some cars piled up within its blackened structure. Steve Amos, who has a vehicle inside, said: We have been left to our own devices. The airport has offered no help at all. We do not know when we are going to have a car again or how we are going to get home now. Mr Amos, who flew into Luton Airport on Friday from Palma, Mallorca, said there has been a total lack of any proper information from airport authorities. 'Astounded' He said he was astounded to hear Bedfordshire's chief fire officer say earlier this week that the car park, which opened in 2019, did not appear to have a sprinkler system. A taxi driver at the airport who saw the fire on Tuesday night criticised the airport's response. They have not helped the poor people that have come down to try to collect their cars. Nobody's out here giving them information, he said. The driver, who did not wish to be named, also criticised the lack of sprinklers in the car park. He added: There is a lot of questions that need to be answered about fire safety. 'Scary' He said it was scary to see cars exploding and estimated that he lost at least 14 hours of work after the taxi rank was shut following the fire. In a statement, London Luton Airport apologised to customers with vehicles in the car park, which is a five-minute walk from the terminal. 'Distress' It said: We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car-parking customers, and that many are still anxious for more detail. We are sorry that we have not been able to respond as quickly as we would have liked. We are working with Apcoa Parking and the Motor Insurers' Bureau who will coordinate with the various vehicle insurance companies. Apcoa Parking said: Terminal Car Park 2 is closed. The fire has caused extensive damage to the car park and there is currently no access to the site.

(AP PhotoJon Chol Jin) The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between Sept. 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russian with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess the Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface to air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. The Korean Central News Agency said Kim made the comments during a two-day session of the country's rubber-stamp parliament, which amended the constitution to include his policy of expanding the country's nuclear weapons program. In Russia, Kim deepened comradely fellowship and friendly ties with Putin, North Korean state media reported. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defense ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of YOU.N. Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The two leaders discussed he latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

PAC-12 TEAM GREEN, read the bag's logo. Washington State coach Kyle Smith can see a little irony in that sort of thing. He and Oregon State's Wayne Tinkle are the only two men's basketball coaches left in the conference as of now for 2024-25, while their Pac-12 rivals will be flying back and forth across the country to play new sets of conference foes starting next season. Especially this league... the (talk about) carbon footprint and green energy? It is like 'You guys are full of it,' Smith said. You cannot put it any more blatant than that.

It is been well-documented that football-driven television money ultimately prompted the the departing schools' decisions to leave. While Arizona, ASU and Colorado will actually face somewhat comparable distances for Big 12 competition next season as they do now in the Pac-12, that is not the case for the other defectors. Except when they are playing among themselves, USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon will be heading to the Midwest or East for Big Ten competition. Located relatively central within the Pac-12 now, Utah will instead have to head further to the south or east for Big 12 games. And the Bay area schools will be leaving the Pacific coast to play games in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Maybe with a trip every other week. It is absurd, Smith said. The Stanford-Cal thing... is the silliest thing I have ever heard for basketball, he said. Smith said he hopes to someday welcome schools back to Pac, while Tinkle, like many of the league's coaches at the conference's men's basketball media day Wednesday, expressed sadness. You have got the people out there who say 'Screw them, they are leaving' but to me, it is just a shame, Tinkle says. We are losing some of the longest contested rivalries out there, but everybody's proven they are doing what is best for them. We just learned that lesson. The avalanche broke out on June 30, 2022, when UCLA coach Mick Cronin was playing a round of golf at the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club, where cellphones are not allowed. He learned right then that the Bruins and Trojans would be headed to the Big Ten in 2024. They literally drove a guy out to tell me. I would never seen a golf cart on that course, Cronin said. It did not surprise me. I am like the Grim Reaper. I was in the Big East (at Cincinnati) when it broke up. Got the job at UCLA and ... I am bad luck. After a full year of having UCLA and USC's decision hover over the league, Colorado announced it was heading to the Big 12 late last July. A week later, the Big Ten pulled in Oregon and Washington, prompting Utah, Arizona and ASU to head the Big 12 the next day. The Pac-12 was done, at least as it is currently known. When UCLA and USC left, it was like, 'Well, now what?' So it is kind of been a long year in that regard. Oregon coach Dana Altman said. Then Colorado left, which created more problems. There was always the threat of Arizona, Utah and everybody going to the Big 12. It was just an uneasy time for everybody. Part of me is really disappointed, because I like the league. I like the rivalries. It is been good for us. Cronin said he correctly predicted that football would lead the drive apart, though maybe not as quickly as it happened. But Cronin, Smith and Tinkle alike also expressed hope from football -- if it winds up going the route advocated in August by UCLA football coach Chip Kelly, who suggested top college football teams should go independent and leave the other sports to stay in more logical geographic rivalries. Cronin said it would happen, especially if the ACC falls apart to leave football with just three major power conferences, and people come to their senses regarding other sports. Look, they play six road games max in football, Cronin said. We play twice a week. We are traveling for MTEs (multi-team events), we are traveling all over the all over the country as it is. And when you start putting all these Olympic sports under those cross-country constraints and we talk about student-athlete all the time... At some point there is common sense. But right now, money is prevailing and it is survival. Cronin said he did not know when football might break off, but that it would once the lucrative NCAA basketball tournament was no longer run by the NCAA. If that day happens, then you can make decisions that are best for basketball, Cronin said. But can the Beavers and Cougars wait for that day? How long can they keep the Pac-12 banner alive, if at all? Some of that may be clearer after a legal fight plays out in Washington state, where WSU and OSU are seeking control of the Pac-12's remaining assets because of what they say is an existential threat to the conference. A preliminary injunction is set for November 14 while the San Jose Mercury News reported that the two sides -- OSUWSU and the 10 departees -- have also agreed to mediation to settle the dispute. If WSU and OSU can gain control of the Pac-12, they will have time to figure something out and without the departing members having a say. NCAA rules mandate that multi-sport conferences have at least seven teams playing men's basketball, though they allow a two-year grace period to build back to that number starting on the date that the withdrawal of schools puts them under the minimum. That means the Cougars and Beavers could hang on to the Pac name until 2026-27, giving them time to recruit Mountain West or other teams, possibly playing as an independent or as an affiliate of another conference until then. We are trying to find a way to just stay together and survive until some other (media) rights are up, Tinkle said. We want to make sure that we keep this brand going, the Pac-12. And it is not just for the financial -- it is for the AQ (automatic NCAA Tournament bid), it is for the football playoff. We are fighting for the Pac-12, and we are pissed off, quite frankly, that this thing is dissolved. But we cannot worry about how it happened. We have got to work together to find solutions. If we handle things the right way the next couple of years, things are going to settle back to maybe a little bit closer to the normalcy that we are used to. But for now, the tension still boils. The hosts of the Pac-12 media day main stage interviews mostly avoided the subject of the conference's future, some questions about the new conferences were discouraged or dismissed during breakout sessions, and commissioner George Kliavkoff did not even show up -- even though it has long been a tradition for the commissioner to address the media and field questions at preseason media days. But, no matter how ugly it gets, Smith says he will not be holding a grudge if some Pac-12 teams eventually return. Whenever, and however, they do. I would love to save the league and also be a home for when they want to come back, Smith said. When it settles out, when football goes on their own, hopefully we still have a Pac-12-whatever-name. I am not going to be mad when they want to come back. I will embrace them. Contact sports reporter Bruce Pascoe at bpascoetucson.com. On X(Twitter): brucepascoe Subscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

A person who was brought to a hospital privately and died there may have been involved in the Thursday night shooting but investigators have not confirmed that, interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said at a late-night news conference. Stanford said the officers were arriving at work and were parked in the garage shortly after 11 p.m. when they saw several people breaking into a vehicle in the parking garage area. As the officers approached, the suspects opened fire, hitting one officer several times in the upper body and the other in the arm, Stanford said. One officer died shortly after 11:30 p.m. at a hospital. His name was not released, but he was 50 years old and had 22 years with the force, Stanford said. The officer was married and had one child. Trending nowLoading... They are here at the hospital, as you can imagine, heartbroken, Stanford said. The other officer was in stable condition. He is 60 years old and has 20 years with the police department, Stanford said. Both were assigned to the airport unit. Police said suspects in the shooting fled in a stolen Dodger Durango, which was being sought, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The same model of car dropped off an 18-year-old man at the hospital. He had two gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead there, the paper said. That person was very similar to the suspect description, but investigators had not confirmed his involvement, Stanford said. The shooting took place in the garage for the airport's Terminal D, which was temporarily closed during the initial investigation but later reopened. Stanford noted that the shooting came only a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this, he said. We just had three officers shot last week. And then this tonight, so you can imagine what we feel. We can imagine what this department is going through. And quite frankly, how the city should be feeling. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said law enforcement staff across multiple agencies were working to identify those responsible, but said they lacked the ability to match crime scene ballistics to firearms through a database of gun sales, citing a lack of gun regulation. Pennsylvania state law prevents law enforcement and government agencies from having firearm registries. Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge President Joseph Regan mourned the officer's death and said members were praying for the wounded officer. We lost a hero today. Regan said. Two local police unions -- Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 and Lodge 27 in Delaware County -- were offering a combined 30,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. That would be in addition to a 20,000 reward that the city has offered for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Speaking Friday at a news conference to announce the police unions' reward, Lodge 5 President John McNesby said the city's police force was under manned and said more officers were needed in the streets. He also was critical of the district attorney's office, saying that if violent offenders are not prosecuted that sends a message they can do what they want. Calling the two officers standouts and noting their long service to the city, McNesby said the loss was a tough one for their colleagues and the department. I saw more tears last night than I have ever seen in all my years here, McNesby said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

We cannot and will not accept the YOU.S. Attorney's decision, Jose and Johnson said. We stand by the Mattia family, and all O'odham citizens in seeking justice. Members of the Tohono O'odham Nation should not have to worry that their lives could be randomly cut short by federal agents acting on Tohono O'odham sovereign land. Mattia died from multiple gunshot wounds, after 10 border agents and at least one Tohono O'odham tribal police officer came to his property the night of May 18. Immediately before agents opened fire, body-cam video released by YOU.S. Customs and Border Protection appeared to show Mattia reach into his jacket then quickly remove his hand in response to agents' commands. Mattia was unarmed at the time; moments earlier he had thrown a machete, still in its sheath, toward agents after they told him to put down what he was holding. On Friday, a spokesman for the YOU.S. Attorney's Office said the office stands by the decision not to bring charges. We stand by our conclusion, and we hear the Chairman's frustration, Zachry Stoebe, public affairs officer for the YOU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona, said in a Friday emailed statement. The YOU.S. Attorney's Office sent a letter to Chairman Jose on Sept. 20, the statement said, expressing condolences for the loss of the victim, describing the investigation and our conclusion, and also informing the Tohono O'odham Nation of the pending review by CBP's National Use of Force Review Board. We decline to comment more specifically on the meeting between the family and the department employees; victims have an inherent right to speak with the press, and to criticize their government, the statement said. The night Mattia was killed, tribal police had requested Border Patrol assistance in response to reports of gunfire in the area, according to CBP statements. Mattia's family said Mattia had called law enforcement himself to report border-crossers on his property, which is in a remote village near the YOU.S.-Mexico border, about 140 miles from Tucson. The family will likely file a civil lawsuit to get the answers that federal officials have refused to provide, Ryan Stitt, the San Diego-based attorney for the Mattia family, said Thursday. The Tohono O'odham Nation's tribal lands encompass both sides of the YOU.S.-Mexico border in Arizona and tribal members say they, and their traditions, have suffered under the increasing militarization of federal border enforcement efforts. For too long, the YOU.S. government's refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O'odham and other border communities, Jose and Johnson's statement said. While politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted and, in this case, killed by federal agents. This must stop.

On X, formerly Twitter: EmilyBregel Tohono O'odham leaders' full statement The YOU.S. Attorney's decision to not press charges against YOU.S. Border Patrol agents in the tragic shooting death of Tohono O'odham member Raymond Mattia is a travesty of justice. The facts speak for themselves, and they do not support the YOU.S. Attorney's decision - Mr. Mattia was an unarmed man in his own front yard. Multiple agents made the decision to fire dozens of shots at short range at this unarmed man, hitting Raymond Mattia multiple times, and ultimately killing him. All of this was captured on agents' video cameras and is not in question. Where in America is a decision in defiance of such overwhelming evidence acceptable? Where in America is it okay for law enforcement officials, or anyone else, to take an unarmed man's life? We assume there is additional evidence beyond what is already in the public domain.

Members of the Tohono O'odham Nation should not have to worry that their lives could be randomly cut short by federal agents acting on Tohono O'odham sovereign land. In Mr. Mattia's case, he was not only on O'odham land, but at his own home, and defenseless. The Nation's Executive Office will explore other opportunities to rectify this misguided decision, which may include requesting Congressional inquiries. We also stand by other legal and administrative efforts to obtain justice for wrongly taking Raymond's life. For too long, the YOU.S. government's refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O'odham and other border communities.

The 911 calls were released to The Associated Press in response to a public record request. They cover a period from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on August 8 as the deadliest YOU.S. wildfire in more than a century, whipped by powerful winds from a passing hurricane, bore down on the town. At least 98 people were killed and more than 2,000 structures were destroyed, most of them homes, leveling a historic town that once served as the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom and a port for whaling ships. Many drivers became trapped on Front Street, surrounded on three sides by black smoke and a wall of flames. They had moments to choose whether to stay or jump into the ocean as cars exploded and burning debris fell around them. Hawaiian Electric, the state's electric utility company, has acknowledged its power lines started a wildfire on Maui, but faulted county firefighters for declaring the blaze contained and leaving the scene, only to have the flames rekindle nearby. The county and the families of some victims have sued Hawaiian Electric, saying the utility negligently failed to shut off power despite exceptionally high winds and dry conditions. The pleas for help came one right after another, people calling because they were stuck in cars on Front Street, trapped by fallen trees and power lines blocking evacuation routes or worried about loved ones who were home alone. Again and again, overwhelmed dispatchers apologized to callers but said there was no one available to send to their location, assuring them emergency responders were working to extinguish the fires. Dispatchers were also fielding emergency calls from outside of Lahaina, including reports of violent crimes and other wildfires burning in a different part of the island. They received more than 4,500 emergency calls and texts that day, according to the Maui Police Department, including hundreds of calls during the time span requested by the AP. Normally, Maui County dispatchers get about 1,600 calls a day. It was an extremely dynamic situation that day, in which our dispatchers adapted to the best of their abilities, Maui Police Department spokesperson Alana Pico wrote in an email. Roughly two-thirds of the known victims who died in the fire were 60 or older, according to a list from Maui County. The calls reflect the helplessness of the situation for those who needed help getting out quickly. In one call at 3:31 p.m., a woman said her daughter already called about an 88-year-old man who was left behind in their house and she wanted emergency personnel to know the sliding doors were unlocked. He would literally have to be carried out, she told the dispatcher. I just had to leave him because I had the rest of my family in the car. A dispatcher said they would update the fire department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Drescher, who serves as the president of SAG-AFTRA, representing more than 100,000 actors, said in an interview that airs Friday on the TODAY show, that and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, known as AMPTP, failed to counter union proposals regarding artificial intelligence protections and residuals from streaming. It really came as a shock to me because what does that exactly mean and why would you walk away from the table? It is not like we are asking for anything that is so outrageous, she said. It is so wrong. And it is so unfair. That they walked out of the meeting and so disrespectful. You know when I was there, I mean they talk at you. They really do not want to hear what you have to say or why you are saying it. The AMPTP did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. The alliance represents NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. Just hours before Drescher spoke out, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos addressed the stalled talks at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in California in which he said, We had very productive talks going, then what kind of happened last night. They introduced this levy on subscribers. It just felt like a bridge too far to add this deep into the negotiation. Sarandos said they had offered the actors a bonus if a show was successful on the streaming platforms, similar to one that was included in the recently ratified deal with writers. The AMPTP, which represents the studios and streamers said, in a statement earlier in the day that SAG-AFTRA's proposal would cost upwards of 800 million dollars annually. Drescher says, That is an inflated price for that benefit of the press. It factors out to 57 cents per year per subscriber, less than a postage stamp. She said that the AMPTP did not counter with another figure. The actors union went on strike in July, weeks after the writers did so. The Writers Guild of America strike ended almost five months later, on Sept. 27. Members of that union ratified its agreement this week. Drescher also said they are far apart on other key issues like raising the minimum wage for actors and protections on artificial intelligence. They refuse to increase that minimum so they can catch up with inflation, and not actually making real money less than they made in 2020, she said. We are fighting tooth and nail to get them the AI protections that they want. But the last thing that Sarandos said when they exited the room yesterday, 'We do not like your counter proposal for AI.' Well, you know, we are looking for the protections that these people deserve. Because it is their likeness. It is their essence of being. It is their talent that is in jeopardy of being ripped off. Adding, We are at a crossroads where it is a very dangerous time, she said. And this is a very important negotiation. What happens here matters. As for when talks will resume, Drescher says there is no meeting set and the union is willing to hold out. We cannot go back to the way things were, she said. It is unsustainable and my members can no longer make a living on this new and unprecedented streaming platform with the old structure of payment. And there are they are going to have to accept that reality.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

As they investigated the scene, they realised just what a nightmare scenario they had potentially prevented. Because, had the police not knocked on his door that Monday morning in late November, the 32-year-old's distinctive name could well be now spoken alongside the likes of Michael Ryan, Thomas Hamilton and Raoul Moat. Wischhusen was certainly fascinated by those twisted murderers, who had gone on their own armed rampages of killing and slaughter. And, as police discovered, Wischhusen had recorded his own plan to do something disturbingly similar - although he claimed in court that it had all just been a 'fantasy'. His plot, which was explained in detail to a jury at Bristol Crown Court this month, thankfully had a different ending. Read next: West Country Lidl worker designed rocket launcher to fire 'mind control drug' Read more: Gunman Wischhusen wanted armed police to 'finish the job', court hears This afternoon (Friday, October 13) he was convicted of: having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. He had previously admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate. Judge Martin Picton had earlier directed the jury to find the defendant guilty of an eighth charge of having an explosive substance. The judge ordered pre-sentence reports and remanded Wischhusen into custody until he is sentenced on December 15. 'One of the most difficult scenes I have ever seen' When DCI Simon Dewfall first set foot in Wischhusen's home in the little village of Wick St Lawrence, he had no idea what he was going to uncover. What happened that morning was already shocking enough - police officers had attended the address to check out why a man, who worked at the nearby Lidl distribution warehouse and was the primary carer for his father, who was suffering from dementia, was buying blank ammunition online. Within just a few minutes, Wischhusen went upstairs saying he needed to use the bathroom, tried to shoot himself in the head, then ran back downstairs pointing that gun at police, before he was shot three times by those police officers. As DCI Dewfall walked into the property, Wischhusen was already in the hospital - where he would remain for four months. His father was being cared for, the shocked neighbours were beginning weeks of disruption and the senior police chief and his team had to piece together what on earth was going on. The scene that we were faced with was one of the most difficult that I have ever seen in my career, he said. It took us weeks to go through that address. Every door we went through, every item we turned over - it was a house of horrors, basically. We found stuff that was really concerning - chemicals, what appeared to be explosives, firearms, ammunition, so we needed the military to come and help us make some of those items safe. We needed to get a range of experts, explosives and ballistics experts to come to the scene to make it safe for the local community, and to recover them to an evidential standard, so that they could be examined so we could understand what Mr Wischhusen was about, he added. There were two strands to the investigation. Firstly amassing, collecting and collating everything Wischhusen actually had there, in terms of firearms and explosives. The second was trying to work out why he had it in the first place - just what was he intending to do with all this dangerous firepower? The answer, as it often does, came from his computer. And it chilled the detectives to the core. We found documents that were frankly chilling Then we uncovered his digital devices, explained DCI Dewfall. On there we found a document and a diary that were frankly chilling. On there, he spelled out the grievances he had with a number of people, both school friends, teachers, members of Avon and Somerset police who he felt had wronged him in life, and he spelled out a plan to attack and kill using firearms and explosives that he built and manufactured himself, he added. An early fear was that Wischhusen had been radicalised online to follow some sort of extremist ideology, and that he was, in effect, a terrorist waiting to become active. That was investigated thoroughly but ruled out. We obviously, in the initial phase of the investigation, sought to understand whether there was a wider threat from anybody else? Whether this was a terrorism issue? Was this a domestic extremist? But all that was bottomed out quite thoroughly, said DCI Dewfall. This was someone who was acting on their own. Wischhusen had a troubled early life, and it was one he could not escape from. He held grudges and kept them so they took over his life. He had applied - twice - for a shotgun licence but - in the first instance of the police's systems working as they should - he was turned down. So those officers, and the police in general, went onto his hit list. Article continues below The only time he came to our attention was when he applied for a shotgun certificate, which he was refused on a couple of occasions, DCI Dewfall explained. That was the centre of his grievance that he felt that was unjust, and he felt wronged by the licensing staff who had declined him a shotgun licence. I think it shows the system works. It was (refused) for a whole range of reasons going back to some of the behaviours he would displayed at school, and some of the concerns the licensing officers had - obviously they do quite a robust set of inquiries before making a decision and it appears they got the decision right, he added. So those licensing officers, and Avon and Somerset police in general, joined a list of other people who, throughout his life, he felt had wronged him. Some of those dated back to primary school, some 25 years or so earlier. Perhaps the saddest part is that when the people on that list were told about it, some could not even remember him from that long ago. DCI Dewfall and his team had the job of informing the people on Wischhusen's hit list, and asking them about it. It was obviously difficult, he said. A lot of these people had not seen Mr Wischhusen for years and some of them could not really remember him or really understand why he wanted to cause them some harm. Others were less surprised, they remembered issues at school between them and him, so they were still shocked and horrified about what he was planning to do to them, but not surprised that he felt there was some old school grievance between them. So it was a range of reactions really, he explained. Wischhusen's plan of intent, written out clearly, went much further than just a list of targets. He had planned out in quite some detail who he was going to target, in what order, and how. Had police not knocked on his door that morning, in a relatively short amount of time, Wischhusen would have had a list, a plan and a pistol, a machine gun, a large amount of ammunition and explosives. He also had a police uniform, complete with the kind of protective vest worn by armed officers. He would have started by visiting a few old classmates, before going to his old primary school in Weston-super-Mare, where he had written he intended to open fire and set off explosives. And then, his intention would have been to go to the Avon and Somerset police headquarters at Portishead, presumably for some kind of final showdown. DCI Dewfall and Avon and Somerset police are today at pains to point out that it is highly unlikely Wischhusen would have got very far into his plan - armed response units and their procedures for that kind of situation would have kicked in and hopefully, a massive loss of life would have been averted. According to the DCI, Wischhusen told police as he recovered from his injuries and was interviewed - and again in court - that he had been taking the pistol he would converted to work with him for five months, hidden in a coat pocket. The machine gun he would been working on was, according to the 32-year-old, 'a weekend away from completion'. He had perfected the art of converting blank ammunition into live ammunition, and had the capability, equipment and expertise to make hundreds or thousands of rounds. No, there is no indication of when, DCI Dewfall paused, as he answered the question he is contemplated a lot in the eleven months since that day in November 2022. He was carrying the firearm with him in his jacket pocket, we know that. That firearm was loaded, he was taking it with him to work for five months. His machine gun, to quote him, was a weekend away from completion, so yes...who knows? That is the unanswered question in this case. If we follow what Mr Wischhusen said he was going to do, he was going to kill those people he would identified as having a grievance with. He was going to attend a school in Weston-super-Mare, discharge his firearm there and set off some explosives and then he was going to the police headquarters in Portishead, and do the same thing there. So that is in his own words. He clearly had the machine gun, he had the capability, he had rounds of ammunition to fit that machine gun, he had the capability to make thousands more, he had a pistol, a silencer for the pistol, he had a police uniform, so I think his capability was certainly there, he said, before adding: Our armed assets would have kicked into play. Perhaps the most chilling part of the investigation for DCI Dewfall is just how comparatively easy it was for Wischhusen to get as far as he did. The police systems did work, in that one of his purchases of blank ammunition was flagged to officers who did then go and knock on his door. But by then, he would already done a lot of work. These are the challenges that we face in the modern police investigation, he said. The internet creates opportunities to view, download, purchase a lot of stuff. It takes a lot of determination, it takes a lot of money, knowledge and skill to do what he was doing. In this case, the system has worked, thankfully, and the intelligence led us to knock on his door on the 28th of November and we prevented him from doing what he was doing, he added. Everything Wischhusen bought - the manuals, the hardware, the ammunition - was all from a well-known online retailer. Even the replica police uniform and body armour. This is something that has caused some alarm, clearly - the photograph of him in the police uniform holding the firearm, said DCI Dewfall. Again, it is one of the challenges we face with the items you can buy freely online. We have reflected on what we do internally, and I am reassured by our internal processes that when officers leave or retire, we have got an audit process for the uniforms to be counted back in. These are replica items that you can buy online, and it is one of the challenges we face. What we need to make sure is that our staff and our buildings are safe and constantly review our own security processes, to prevent someone who has bought some uniform on eBay running into one of our buildings, he added. Overall, it is a case unlike any this senior police officer has ever faced before. Most people will have some angst - it is human is not it, that we do not get on with everybody and we have got some grievances throughout our lives? DCI Dewfall contemplated. 'Very rare' But with this individual, this is not only someone who has got those issues, he is gone on to document those, with a revenge document detailing a plan of how he is going to exact his revenge, he is downloaded documents and manuals, he is followed them, he is collected the material to build and manufacture firearms, ammunitions, explosives, he is actually built himself a machine gun, converted a pistol to a viable firearm, manufactured ammunition and had the capability to manufacture thousands of rounds, so he has these weapons and he is someone who is very dangerous. As alarming as this is, and as shocking as it is, this is not something we are dealing with often, this is very rare. This is a lone individual and, as well as he is done to manufacture the machine gun and the pistol, these are not military-grade weapons, they are home built, likely to stop working, likely to jam, likely to fail. So it is that balance of it being really alarming, balanced with the question: 'Would he have been able to see that attack through to completion?' We will never know but the plans that we have got in place to deal with such an event would undoubtedly kick in from the get-go, he added. Wischhusen had denied charges relating to intent to endanger life, and also denied possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. He said that his written plans were a fantasy story to amuse myself, the jury heard.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

On Wednesday night all the 23 coaches of the superfast train from Delhi's Anand Vihar Terminus to Assam's Kamakhya had derailed near Raghunathpur station, killing four people and leaving 71 injured. According to the HT report, which cited sources, a 15-page joint note signed by the on-duty station master, points man, gateman, loco pilot, assistant loco pilot, and track man has said that the accident may have been caused by a fault of the engineering department. Besides the injured passengers and locals, the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) has recorded their statement. The issue was also discussed among the East Central Railway (ECR) officials at the accident site on Friday morning, they added. ALSO READ Bihar Train Accident: 10 trains canceled, 21 diverted as North East Express derails in Buxar. Check the full list here Gateman Nand Kishore Singh in his statement said he saw sparking and heard heavy noise when the train was passing, while loco pilot Bipin Kumar Sinha said that when the train was crossing the Raghunathpur home signal and a railway crossing he felt heavy vibration, jerk in the back portion of the locomotive and found pressure drop in the break pipe. If the loco pilot found pressure dropped during the running train, there is a possibility of one of the wheels getting down from the track leading to automatic break or a possibility of leakage in the brake pipe, HT quoted a senior official of the Indian Railway as saying. Apart from this, he also said that 30 minutes before the incident, the 15232 Down Durg-Barauni train, which was running on a changed route, passed on the same track and its loco pilot also felt a vibration. In such a case, he has to inform the station manager about such vibrations and only an inquiry will reveal whether such information was shared with the station manager or not, said a railway official. On Thursday, two senior railways officials had said that the because of the derailment, according to a preliminary investigation, seemed to be a fault in the tracks, specifically a rail fracture, or a gap in the tracks. Over 45 hours after the tragic railway accident, a trial run was conducted on the affected railway tracks on Friday. Several trains resumed operations on up line in the morning while the down line was restored for operation in the evening. Within 48 hours of the tragedy, train movement on up and down line was normalized. Train movement will begin from now, said the chief public relations officer (CPRO) of East Central Railway, Birendra Kumar. With agency inputs. Exciting news!

The officers were off-duty but about to start their work shift at the airport, said Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford. The double shooting was reported just after 11 p.m. in the Terminal D parking garage, Stanford said at a news briefing. Suspects in the shooting are still at large. A 50-year-old officer with 22 years on the force was shot several times in the upper torso, Stanford said. The officer, whose name was not released, was pronounced dead at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center at 11:34 p.m. Stanford said he was married with one child. The officer's family members were at the hospital and heartbroken, devastated, he said. The second officer, who is 60 years old, was wounded in the arm. He was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition, Stanford said. Please wrap your arms and prayers around their families and our department, Stanford posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, early Friday morning. We will continue our search for those responsible and will not stop until all are in custody! A short time before Stanford's briefing outside Penn Presbyterian, police said one or more of the shooters had fled from the shooting scene at the airport in a black 2022 Dodge Durango, which was later determined to be stolen with a license plate of PLUSTAX. Shortly after the shooting, a black Dodge Durango dropped off an 18-year-old man at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with two gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead. Stanford said they had not yet confirmed that the vehicle and deceased man were involved in the shooting of the officers. One of the officers was in full uniform and the second was in partial uniform, Stanford said. The interim commissioner noted that three officers were shot just last week in the city's Rhawnhurst section. A gun belonging to one of the off-duty officers may have been taken from the shooting scene, police said earlier. Airport officials posted an advisory on social media announcing that Terminal D and the Terminal D parking garage were closed due to the police investigation. Just after 12:30 a.m., the airport announced that the terminal had been reopened, but the parking garage remained closed. 2023 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC. Visit at inquirer.com.

Two officers assigned to the airport had arrived at an airport parking garage for their shift just after 11 p.m. when they found a few individuals breaking into another vehicle, Interim Philadelphia Police Commissioner John M.

One officer, 50, was struck multiple times in the upper torso while the other officer, 60, was hit in the arm, Stanford said. Both were transported to a nearby hospital. The 50-year-old was transported again to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m, Stanford said.

Raynaud's phenomenon, which causes parts of the body like the fingers and the toes to go cold and numb, likely stems from two genes, a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications found. The results of the study -- the largest genetic study of the condition to date -- could lead to more effective treatments, experts said. In people with Raynaud's phenomenon, cold temperatures or stress trigger spasms in the small blood vessels near the surface of the skin, causing the vessels to constrict and limit blood flow. The fingers and toes are most commonly affected, according to the Mayo Clinic. The skin will turn white or blue and then red when the attack ebbs. It gets painful and numb, said Dr. Marie Gerhard-Herman, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a staff physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital specializing in cardiovascular medicine. During an attack, people may not be able to move their hands as they want, added Gerhard-Herman, who was not involved with the new study. Dr. Laura Hummers, a rheumatologist and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that while medications for Raynaud's are available, they can have unwanted side effects. The main therapy currently is a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers, said Hummers, who was also not involved with the new research. Those therapies are fairly helpful. But they lower blood pressure, which can be a problem for otherwise healthy people, she said. And they can cause side effects, such as constipation, dizziness and headache, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Raynaud's occurs in 2 to 5 of the population, more commonly in women, and takes two forms. Primary Raynaud's is by far the most common and is typically diagnosed in teenage girls and women in their 20s, Gerhard-Herman said. Its symptoms are often manageable with lifestyle changes alone, such as avoiding cold and limiting stress. However, some patients' symptoms are so bothersome that they must use medication. The genes identified in the study are linked to primary Raynaud's. Secondary Raynaud's is rare and its symptoms can be more serious, including ulcers on fingers and gangrene, and medication is often necessary. It occurs in people with autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, which causes thickening and inflammation of the skin, and lupus, which causes inflammation throughout the body. Raynaud's runs in families and is heritable. About half the people who have primary Raynaud's phenomenon have another first-degree relative who also has Raynaud's, said Hummers, who co-directs John Hopkins Scleroderma Center. The new study explains why. Researchers in London and Berlin looked at data from more than 440,000 people in the UK Biobank, a massive database containing genetic and medical information.The team identified 5,147 cases of Raynaud's, 68 of which were primary Raynaud's. Another 439,294 records served as controls. We identify two distinct genes that point to two distinct mechanisms, said Maik Pietzner, one of the study's lead researchers and chair in health data modeling at Queen Mary University of London's Precision Healthcare University Research Institute. One gene variant affects how blood vessels narrow. People with this variant have a high number of a particular receptor for hormones that are released when the body is stressed or cold, he said. These hormones signal the tiny blood vessels in the skin to constrict, allowing blood to flow away from the extremities and to the body's vital organs. The other gene variant affects how blood vessels dilate, or relax, he said. The findings could hopefully lead to new treatments: Drugs could be developed that target this hormone receptor, for example, Pietzner said. One existing drug, an antidepressant called mirtazapine, already acts on the receptor and could possibly be repurposed for people with Raynaud's, he said. For patients, it is all about finding treatments, he said. While the two gene variants were linked to primary Raynaud's, not to the secondary form, any new drugs developed might help people with both, Hummers said. The researchers noted that the study had limitations. For example, they relied on diagnostic codes in people's electronic health records, which are not always reliable. As a result, some cases of Raynaud's may have been missed while others might have been misdiagnosed. In addition, the participants were all of European descent, and so the results cannot be generalized to all people. More studies are needed, the researchers wrote. They need to actually look at people with other ancestries, Gerhard-Herman said. Still, the large study is the first to identify the underlying genetics of the condition. The genetic studies that have been done in Raynaud's up until this point had not been as compelling as this one, Hummers said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Both officers had just arrived to work at the airport, when Interim Commissioner John Stanford says they came across a group of suspects attempting to break into a vehicle in the garage. The officers approached the suspects who proceeded to open fire. One of the officers was shot multiple times in the torso and the other was shot in the arm. The officer who was hit multiple times was rushed to Penn Presbyterian Hospital where he was pronounced dead just after 11:30 p.m., Stanford said. The second officer was taken to Jefferson Hospital where he was listed in stable condition. The slain officer was a 22-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department, according to Stanford, and was married with one child. Stanford described the killing as a numb moment for his department after three officers were injured in a shooting last week. The department, along with his family, gathered at the hospital to salute their fellow officer and escort his body to the medical examiner's office, then a local funeral home. City leaders spoke out after the deadly shooting to express their anger, devastation and heartbreak. Anger, devastation and heartbreak are the emotions. One officer gave his life tonight and one is recovering. Please wrap your arms and prayers around their families and our department. We will continue our search for those responsible and will not stop until all are in custody! Stanford said. Mayor James Kenney offered his thoughts and prayers to the families of both officers after the city's tragic loss. District Attorney Larry Krasner is urging anyone with information to come forward to help them identify suspects in the deadly shooting. Police go to work every day knowing they could at any moment encounter someone who has no business holding a gun, has a gun anyway, and is willing to fire upon others for no reason at all, Krasner said. Authorities have not reported any arrests in the wake of the deadly shooting. Stanford said police believe a possible suspect was taken by private vehicle to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where he was pronounced dead. Police are searching for a black Dodge Durango that FOX 29's Steve Keeley reports was seen fleeing the scene of the shooting by plowing through an airport gate. Police are scouring surveillance video in hopes to track down the vehicle.

All 23 coaches of the superfast train from Delhi's Anand Vihar Terminus to Assam's Kamakhya had derailed near Raghunathpur station, killing four people and leaving 71 injured. A 15-page joint note signed by the on-duty station master, points man, gateman, loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and track man has said that the accident may have been caused by a fault of the engineering department, the people said. The commissioner of railway safety (CRS), who is probing the accident, has recorded their statement, besides the injured passengers and locals. The issue was also discussed among the East Central Railway (ECR) officials at the accident site on Friday morning, they added. In their statement, gateman Nand Kishore Singh said that he saw sparking and heard heavy noise when the train was passing. Loco pilot Bipin Kumar Sinha said that when the train was crossing Raghunathpur home signal and a railway crossing he felt heavy vibration, jerk in the back portion of the locomotive and found pressure drop in the break pipe. If the loco pilot found pressure dropped during the running train, there is a possibility of one of the wheels getting down from the track leading to automatic break or a possibility of leakage in the brake pipe, said a senior official of the Indian Railway, who is part of the investigation team. He also said that 30 minutes before the incident, 15232 Down Durg-Barauni train, which was running on a changed route, passed on the same track and its loco pilot also felt vibration. In such a case, he has to inform the station manager about such vibrations and only an inquiry will reveal whether such information was shared with the station manager or not, said a railway official. Earlier on Thursday, two senior railways officials, on condition of anonymity, had said that the because of the derailment, according to a preliminary investigation, seemed to be a fault in the tracks, specifically a rail fracture, or a gap in the tracks. Meanwhile, a trial run was conducted on the affected railway tracks on Fiday, over 45 hours after the tragic railway accident. Several trains resumed operations on up line in the morning while the down line was restored for operation in the evening. Within 48 hours of the tragedy, train movement on up and down line was normalised. Train movement will begin from now, said chief public relations officer (CPRO) of East Central Railway, Birendra Kumar, adding that most of the debris has been cleared off the track.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Reed Wischhusen, 32, had a macabre interest in the Dunblane gunman Thomas Hamilton and Raoul Moat and US mass killers, and had built firearms and explosives to carry out a hitman-style attack on his former school. In the attack he would deliberately target 10 people, as well as shoot dead teachers and attack Avon and Somerset Police headquarters. The Lidl warehouse worker wrote down his warped plans in a document he dubbed revenge, Bristol Crown Court heard. To carry out his plans he compiled an armoury of homemade weapons including pistols, sub-machine guns and a shotgun, as well as ammunition, bombs, grenades and poison. Wischhusen's plans were only stopped when uniformed officers visited the home he shared with his father in Wick Road, Wick St Lawrence, Somerset in November last year, having received a tip-off about weapons. During the search of his home, Wischhusen attempted to shoot himself in the head with a concealed pistol in his bathroom, before running downstairs with the gun to confront armed officers. Fearing they were going to be killed, the defendant was shot twice by officers and he spent several months recovering in hospital. Following a 10-day trial, a jury found the defendant guilty of having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. He had previously admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate. Judge Martin Picton had earlier directed the jury to find the defendant guilty of an eighth charge of having an explosive substance. The judge ordered pre-sentence reports and remanded Wischhusen into custody until he is sentenced on December 15. In terms of where we go from here, I would not be prepared to sentence without a pre-sentence report and I will order one and it will have to look at the issue of dangerousness, the judge said. I think there should also be a psychiatric report because there are so many troubling features about the defendant's conduct. Be nice to get back at the people who caused me stress and worry over the years Wischhusen had equipment in his outhouse to manufacture the pistols, sub-machine guns, ammunition and explosives needed for the plans he set out in the 1,700-word revenge document, the court was told. Yes, revenge is on my mind it is a powerful motivator, be nice to get back at the people who caused me stress and worry over the years it is been eating away at my brain like cancer, he wrote in an introduction. Phase one was to kill 10 people, including ex-classmates, teachers and police staff, using a converted pistol with a silencer, while wearing disguised clothing and a wig. He planned to spare two police staff so they would feel survivor's guilt, citing Dunblane killer Hamilton as inspiration. He would then walk into his old school, Priory School in Worle, to shoot and kill teachers and throw pipe bombs before evading police. The plan would culminate in an attack on Avon and Somerset Police's headquarters, where he would either plant and detonate pressure cooker bombs before opening fire on staff with sub-machine guns or ambush officers and enter the building to let off explosives. After this he planned to kill himself, the court was told. Wischhusen can expect to serve a considerable amount of time in prison following the verdicts and I hope this provides reassurance to anyone concerned about his actions and plans He signed off his detailed plans by saying: This would make national news, even international as a endowment life member of the NRA they be possibly blamed for radicalizing me. But I have been like this way before I became an NRA member. But granted homemade guns do not count it be brilliant it get every bit of anti-gun democrat milf going. That alone would be so cathartic! It has to happen, regardless. Wischhusen denied the plot and said it was all fantasy and he never had any intention of harming anyone. Describing his writings, he told jurors: It was a psychological release and feelings like I am getting back at people. It is clear Wischhusen took a macabre interest in mass shootings and, had he not been stopped, had the means to enact his deadly plan with terrible consequences It is why people write their feelings down and tear it up and throw it away - just I forgot to throw it away. I got power over them by writing it down. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Dewfall, who led the investigation, said: Wischhusen can expect to serve a considerable amount of time in prison following the verdicts and I hope this provides reassurance to anyone concerned about his actions and plans. Andrew Pritchard, from the Crown Prosecution Service South West, said: It is clear Wischhusen took a macabre interest in mass shootings and, had he not been stopped, had the means to enact his deadly plan with terrible consequences. His intention was to send a brutal and violent message to those he felt had wronged him throughout his life, from school bullies, to police staff who had refused him firearms licences, to his bosses at work. Throughout this trial, he attempted to paint the picture that he was a tinkerer with a vague interest in weapons and explosives. This picture was rejected by the jury and I would like to take the opportunity to thank the prosecution team's efforts in unpicking Wischhusen's account.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The 50-year-old officer, who had served with the force for more than 22 years, was killed before he started his night shift around 11pm at Philadelphia International Airport. He and his colleague, who were assigned to the airport unit, were stepping out of their vehicle when they spotted a group of people breaking into another car. As the officers interrupted and confronted the alleged car thieves, at least two suspects pulled out guns and fired multiple shots. The deceased officer was shot multiple times in the upper torso while his 60-year-old workmate was shot at least once in the arm, according to the police. At 11:34pm, the 50-year-old veteran was pronounced dead at Presbyterian Medical Center. He is survived by his wife and one child. A Philadelphia police officer was killed, and another was injured inside a garage(pictured) at Philadelphia International Airport while attempting to stop a carjacking on Thursday night The slain officer's body was transported from the medical examiner's office to a funeral house Interim Commissioner John Stanford said it is a sensitive moment for members of the Philadelphia police as three were still in recovery from last week's shooting 'The officer that was murdered tonight, he is married with a child, they are here at the hospital, as you can imagine, heartbroken and devastated that their family member is not coming home tonight,' Interim Commissioner John Stanford said. The police have not identified the slain officer, as his immediate family needs time to notify other family members and friends. The surviving officer, a 20-year veteran of the department, was transported to Jefferson University Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. While the crime unfolding and one officer being killed, three Philadelphia police officers are still in recovery from last week's shooting. Members of the Philadelphia police were visibly emotional before the procession for the fallen officer, NBC reported. His body was draped in an American flag while being escorted to the medical examiner's office inside the Philadelphia Police Headquarters. He was later transported from the office to a funeral house.

A person who was brought to a hospital privately and died there may have been involved in the Thursday night shooting but investigators have not confirmed that, interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said at a late-night news conference. Stanford said the officers were arriving at work and were parked in the garage shortly after 11 p.m. when they saw several people breaking into a vehicle in the parking garage area. As the officers approached, the suspects opened fire, hitting one officer several times in the upper body and the other in the arm, Stanford said. One officer died shortly after 11:30 p.m. at a hospital. His name was not released but he was 50 years old and had 22 years with the force, Stanford said. The officer was married and had one child, Stanford said. They are here at the hospital, as you can imagine, heartbroken, Stanford said. The other officer was in stable condition. He is 60 years old and has 20 years with the police department, Stanford said. Both were assigned to the airport unit. Police said suspects in the shooting fled in a stolen Dodger Durango, which was being sought, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The same model of car dropped off an 18-year-old man, who had two gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead there, the paper said. That person was very similar to the suspect description but investigators had not confirmed his involvement, Stanford said. The shooting took place in the garage for the airport's Terminal D, which was temporarily closed during the initial investigation but later reopened. Stanford noted that the shooting came only a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this, he said. We just had three officers shot last week. And then this tonight, so you can imagine what we feel. We can imagine what this department is going through. And quite frankly, how the city should be feeling. (Copyright (c) 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.)

One of the officers did not survive. His body was escorted by police motorcycles to the city Medical Examiner's Office early Friday morning. A procession up I-95 North was bringing the officer's body to the Givnish Funeral Home on Academy Road in Northeast Philadelphia. The other officer was in stable condition at Jefferson University Hospital. Two other Philadelphia police officers were injured in a crash while trying to get to the shooting scene at the airport. The crash happened at 48th Street and Baltimore Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia. There is no word on the officers' condition and what led to the crash. The shooting comes one week after three police officers were shot in Northeast Philadelphia after a domestic incident. All three of those officers have since been released from the hospital. Procession brings officer's body to funeral home A police escort brought the fallen officer from the medical examiner's office to the John F. Givnish Funeral Home on Academy Road in Northeast Philadelphia on Friday morning. Officers went up I-95 North before arriving at the funeral home. Shooting at Philadelphia International Airport garage Thursday night, the two officers were starting their shift - one was in full uniform, and the other was in partial uniform - when they saw a group breaking into a vehicle in the garage, Interim Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Stanford said in a news conference early Friday morning. When the officers approached the group, the group fired at the officers. One officer was hit multiple times in the torso and did not survive. The other officer was shot in the arm. It is unclear if either of the officers fired their weapons in the incident. Sources say a gun from one of the officers is missing. Preliminary information shows the suspects may have fled in a Dodge Durango, but police are still working to confirm that. Friday morning, a Durango arrived at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and dropped off an 18-year-old who had been shot, Stanford said. That teenager later died. Police said it is unclear if that person is involved in this shooting. The officer who was killed is 50 years old and served in the Philadelphia Police Department for 22 years, Stanford said. He worked with the 25th Police District before getting assigned to the airport. That officer leaves behind a wife and one child. The other officer is 60 years old and has 20 years of experience with the department. Anger, devastation and heartbreak are the emotions. One officer gave his life tonight and one is recovering. Please wrap your arms and prayers around their families and our department. We will continue our search for those responsible and will not stop until all are in custody, Stanford said on Twitter. State Fraternal Order of Police releases statement on death of officer Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge President Joseph Regan sent a statement on the shooting. We lost a hero today. Our deepest condolences go out to the officer's loved ones during this difficult time, Regan said. We stand together with the Philadelphia Police Department and FOP Lodge 5 in honoring this hero's sacrifice and praying for the full recovery of the injured officer. Philadelphia leaders, Gov. Shapiro share statements on shooting Heartbroken by the tragic loss of a PhillyPolice officer, Mayor Jim Kenney wrote on X on Friday. My thoughts are with their family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time, and I pray for the second officer's swift recovery. District Attorney Larry Krasner sent a statement mentioning the high number of guns in the YOU.S. Law enforcement across multiple agencies are working continuously to identify those responsible -- without the ability to quickly match ballistics on scene to a firearm that can be traced via database to point of regulated sale and owner, all because gun-crazy politicians serve the NRA's bloody agenda instead of serving and protecting the public, Krasner's statement said. America has more guns than people, thanks to the same gun-crazy politicians who oppose commonsense gun regulations. Krasner added that Police go to work every day knowing they could at any moment encounter someone who has no business holding a gun, has a gun anyway, and is willing to fire upon others for no reason at all. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he and First Lady Lori Shapiro are praying for the officer's family and the department. Airport releases statement after shooting in Terminal DE garage The shooting temporarily closed Terminal D but it has since reopened. Some SEPTA bus routes were bypassing the airport after the shooting. SEPTA routes are now back on schedule. A spokesperson for the airport released a statement Friday mourning the officers and asking for anyone with information to call the police tipline. Philadelphia International Airport is safe and open for passengers and staff this morning. We join the City of Philadelphia and our region in mourning the loss of one Philadelphia Police Airport Division officer and keep his loved ones and colleagues in our prayers.

The Lidl warehouse worker was found guilty at Bristol Crown Court of having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. He had previously admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate. Judge Martin Picton had earlier directed the jury to find the defendant, of Wick Road, Wick St Lawrence, Somerset, guilty of an eighth charge of having an explosive substance. The judge ordered pre-sentence reports and remanded Wischhusen into custody until he is sentenced on December 15. In terms of where we go from here, I would not be prepared to sentence without a pre-sentence report and I will order one and it will have to look at the issue of dangerousness, the judge said. I think there should also be a psychiatric report because there are so many troubling features about the defendant's conduct. Wischhusen had drawn up the 'kill-list' of former classmates and others he wanted to target, a jury was told. He told the trial he had 'hated' all the individuals on the list - but claimed he was too much of a coward to carry out what he described as a fantasy. The 'chilling' documents were found by cops after they attended his home in Wick St Lawrence, near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, on 28 November last year. The trial heard they were following up intelligence that he had purchased blank weapons capable of being converted into viable firearms. But during the visit, the defendant took himself to the bathroom and shot himself behind his ear. He then rushed at cops while pointing a gun at them - and was shot three times. One of the firearms officers told the trial he thought I was going to die during the incident. But Wischhusen told the jury that pointing the gun was a suicide attempt and he wanted police to finish the job. He was arrested and charged with multiple offences after spending four months recovering in hospital. Giving evidence during the trial, the defendant accepted he had a long fascination with guns and had a number of weapons, including an antique shotgun that hung on his wall and a homemade submachine gun. He was also storing chemicals that could be used to make IEDs, the court heard. He had dropped other weaponry into a police amnesty six months before the incident - and claimed he built the weapons to prove a point after being rejected twice for a licence. He also denied claims he ever had intentions to make explosives or build a bomb. But prosecutors argued that the 'revenge' document had outlined his murderous intentions - and said he was 'building' the weaponry needed to turn it into a reality. In it, he wrote the first phrase would be a hitman style attack where he would use a range of disguises to give him a more Arab look. He said he begin by using a converted pistol with a silencer for the ten named victims. He then outlined different scenarios for the next phrase of his attack. One included a diversion stage where he would get back at the school, walk in and shoot a few teachers dead, and throw a pipe bomb or two to stir things up. Another scenario he wrote would involve triggering the fire alarm at Avon and Somerset Police HQ and plant pressure cooker bombs at the fire assembly point and detonate them, then open fire at staff with submachine guns etc. He said he would then access the building with a stolen ID before setting up a gas explosion and then committing suicide with the shotgun. He wrote: Hopefully the gas explosion would destroy a good chunk of the building just like the Oklahoma bombing in 1995 but a very mini version. Another scenario he wrote about was to ambush and kill (police) staff sitting outside before going room to room shooting at office staff. He said he would then open fire out the windows and throw pipe bombs while remotely detonating the pressure cooker bombs planted around the building before taking his own life. He wrote: This sounds the best one - a Columbine style attack. He also documented the huge arsenal of weapons - including homemade guns and explosives and other equipment - he would use in the attacks. In the document, he also wrote: Yes, revenge is on my mind it is a powerful motivator, be nice to get back at the people who caused me stress and worry over the years it is been eating away at my brain like cancer. The trial heard that alongside his firearms he also stored vast quantities of chemicals that could be used to create 'IEDs', a court heard. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees KC told the jury said over a sustained period of time the defendant had developed a macabre interest in infamous killers such as Thomas Hamilton, the Dunblane shooter, Raoul Moat, and American cop killer Ralph Mclean He said he also obsessed about mass shootings and bombings such as Columbine and the Oklahoma bombing. Mr Rees added: This defendant sought unlawfully to build a small armoury of firearms and explosives. As you will hear, he succeeded in part. The question for you is why he did that. The answer, according to a document he wrote in 2022, was revenge. The defendant denied multiple firearms offences and says he never intended carrying out an attack - and described what he wrote as just a fantasy. He told the jury: I am too much of a coward to kill someone - to be honest - I did not have it in me. It was not going to happen - I did not have it in me to kill - I have never done anything like it. He also claimed he never intended to cause any harm to the police who visited his home. He added: I wanted them to shoot me dead - not to shoot them dead. In closing arguments, Mr Rees KC told the jury after acquiring such an arsenal his promise that it would remain a fantasy was worthless. He said the defendant accepted he had fantasies to kill and told the jury You do not have to decide if he had the intent to kill, but did he intend to put others lives in danger. Closing his case, Adam Vaitilingam KC, defending, told the jury his client had never intended to go out and kill people and described him as just a bit of a sad character and a bit of a fantasist. He said the reality was his client was just living in a sad fantasy world. Wischhusen had denied charges of having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. They jury found him guilty on all counts. He had also denied a charge of having an explosive substance, but changed his plea to guilty during the trial. He had already pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate. After the verdicts, which were a combination of majority and unanimous, Judge Martin Picton said: In terms of where we go, I am not prepared to sentence without a pre-sentence report to look at the issue of dangerousness, in a psychiatric report. There are so many troubling features about the defendant's conduct. He thanked the jury and told them it was a difficult case. The video footage was difficult to watch, he added. What you did not see was the extraordinary lengths police went to to save the defendant's life. It was impressive to see the dedication to preserve his life after he was shot. It was incredible to see the professionalism. This was a really sad case, troubling, and I need to know much more about the defendant. Wischhusen will now be sentenced for all charges on December 15.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

The authorities are preparing a decree to restrict access to the area around the Inkoo LNG floating terminal, the Interior Ministry said on Friday, days after Finland's President Sauli Niinisto said that the damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline is likely to have been caused by external activity. Based on information from the Finnish Border Guard, Gasgrid Finland has given its expert assessment according to which the damage was not caused by the normal gas transmission process, the Finnish government said on Tuesday. Finland now plans to include the area around the Inkoo LNG floating terminal to the list of around 230 facilities of strategic importance in the country where access, travel, and stay are restricted. After the Balticconnector gas pipeline was shut down due to the leak, Finland's gas grid operator said that the state of the Finnish gas system is stable, and the supply of gas is secured via Inkoo LNG floating terminal. Finland set up the Inkoo LNG floating terminal under a deal for a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel between Gasgrid Finland Oy and YOU.S. firm Excelerate Energy in May 2022, days after Russia cut off pipeline gas supply to Finland. The suspected external activity on the Finland-Estonia pipeline, a year after the sabotage on Nord Stream, has prompted Finland and its Nordic neighbors to increased security measures and patrols at critical energy infrastructure. In Norway, for example, police have increased security measures and patrols at and around oil and gas infrastructure in west Norway, which is home to or close to many oil and gas installations.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Reed Wischhusen had a macabre interest in infamous killers, including the Dunblane gunman Thomas Hamilton and US mass shootings, and had built firearms and explosives to carry out the assault. He planned to deliberately target 10 people he felt had wronged him in the attack, as well as shoot dead teachers and attack Avon and Somerset Police headquarters. The 32-year-old Lidl warehouse worker wrote down his planned mass shootings - which he planned to carry out disguised as a police officer - in a 1,700 document he dubbed revenge, Bristol Crown Court heard. A photo of Wischhusen dressed in a police uniform and holding a gun was later discovered to be the background image on his phone. After receiving a tip-off, police officers searched his home in Wick St Lawrence, Somerset, in November last year and found he had compiled an armoury of homemade weapons including pistols, sub-machine guns and a shotgun, as well as ammunition, bombs, grenades and poison. Wischhusen attempted to shoot himself in the head with a concealed pistol in his bathroom during the police search of his home, before running downstairs with the gun to confront armed officers. Fearing they were going to be killed, the defendant was shot twice by officers and he spent several months recovering in hospital. Following a 10-day trial, a jury found the defendant guilty of having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. He had previously admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate. Judge Martin Picton had earlier directed the jury to find the defendant guilty of an eighth charge of having an explosive substance. He adjourned the case until 15 December for sentencing and remanded Wischhusen into custody until then. Wischhusen told jurors during his trial he had no intention of carrying out his plot, saying: It was a psychological release and feelings like I am getting back at people. It is why people write their feelings down and tear it up and throw it away - just I forgot to throw it away.

Had he not been caught when he was, the consequences simply do not bear thinking about. He claimed his plans were merely fantasy but it is clear he was actively working towards acting on them, with many of the items he identified as needing for his attacks recovered from his address. He had explosive substances and firearms capable of causing lethal harm while, chillingly, he also had Avon and Somerset Police uniform. While the weapons he built were crudely constructed, they were extremely dangerous. Among those he admitted handing in during a firearms amnesty was a fully operational sub-machine gun, which was loaded with ammunition. Incidents of this nature are thankfully few and far between, but when they do happen our officers are ready to respond to them.

On his Facebook page, Wischhusen, 32, described himself as down to earth and very shy, a lover of 80s and 90s music and video games. He seemed isolated and lonely, but law-abiding and harmless. However, when police searched his home in November last year, they found an armoury of weapons and ammunition that Wischhusen had constructed or collected over the past decade including a homemade submachine gun, pistols, an antique rifle, live ammunition, silencers and a grenade. He had gathered large quantities of substances and components including acids, timers, igniters, pressure cookers and ball bearings capable of being turned into homemade bombs or improvised explosive devices, as well as genuine items such as an Avon and Somerset police uniform, bullet-proof vests, handcuffs, knives and a set of locksmith's master keys. Shocked police were to find a revenge plan that detailed a scheme to assassinate former schoolmates and a teacher before carrying out a mass shooting at the school and then heading to Avon and Somerset police headquarters in Portishead 12 miles away to kill officers and staff by opening fire with machine guns and setting off bombs. It has to happen, he concluded. Wischhusen said his plan was fantasy, that he had collected the guns and ammunition only to get back at the police for refusing him a firearms licence. He accepted he had components and chemicals that could be turned into bombs but said they were for experiments. And the revenge document was pure fantasy. His time at the Priory school in Worle, Weston-super-Mare, was unhappy. He complained he was bullied. He was once pinned up against a wall and on another occasion was pushed into mud. Wischhusen had a better time when he moved to Weston College but was disappointed in his lack of popularity with girls. His interest in guns really began when a family friend talked to him about clay pigeon shooting and in 2009, when he was in his late teens, he applied for a firearms licence but was refused. He later tried to find out why and came to believe it was because he was judged to have childlike views of the world. Wischhusen also applied to become a special (voluntary) constable with Avon and Somerset police but, again, was turned down, which also rankled. He simmered. He became fascinated by Raoul Moat, the gunman who shot his former girlfriend, her new boyfriend, and a police officer in 2010. He joined a rifle club, got a job, and started researching online how to source and make weapons and ammunition. He found a do-it-yourself submachine gun guide and full auto assault shotgun construction plans. Wischhusen also obtained a copy of Hit Man On-Line: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors, a book written in 1983 by an American writer under the pseudonym Rex Feral which has been blamed for inspiring a triple murder in Maryland. At the start of 2022, he began to write out his plans. Revenge on my mind, it is a powerful motivator, he began. Wischhusen wrote that he would embark on a series of attacks, starting with a classmate who had pinned him against a wall. Soon I will be chasing him down with a silenced pistol, he wrote. He identified other former schoolmates, a teacher who he said had humiliated him, and police staff. Of one police employee, he wrote he would definitely waste him. Phase 1 was a hitman-style assault on 10 named people which he said would be carried out with a converted pistol with a silencer and wearing a disguise. The next, phase 2A, would be to go to Priory school, shoot a few teachers dead and throw pipe bombs to stir things up. Phase 2B would be to head to Avon and Somerset police's headquarters in Portishead during the panic that was bound to follow, set off fire alarms and when staff gathered outside detonate bombs and open fire. He would then access the building, using ID from one of his victims, and set off a gas explosion - like a mini version of the 1995 Oklahoma bombing, he wrote - before killing himself. A second option for this last part - phase 2C - was a Columbine-style attack in which he would ambush and kill staff outside the police HQ, then get in and open fire, throw pipe bombs from the upper windows and detonate a pressure-cooker bomb. Again, the attack would end with his suicide. The prosecution claimed he was fascinated by mass killers such as the Dunblane gunman Thomas Hamilton. Wischhusen himself has conceded he had a macabre interest in mass shootings and cult suicide documentaries. In May 2022, Wischhusen appeared to have had a change of heart. He walked into Nailsea police station and surrendered some of his weapons, including a handmade machine gun as part of a national amnesty. The officer who took the weapons from him was astonished by what he had brought in. Wischhusen refused to give his name and was allowed to walk free. But he kept developing his weapons. When police caught up with him, he had six weapons, including another partly built submachine gun, a working handgun he had converted from a blank firing pistol and an antique rifle also capable of being fired. Were his plans credible? After his arrest, gun and explosives experts examined his armoury in detail. A specialist who looked at the machine gun he had handed in during the amnesty said it was simple but effective. As well as making and collecting the hardware needed, he had done some research on potential victims, paying for a report to check an address of one, checking the married name of a teacher he was targeting. On 28 November 2022, two neighbourhood officers backed by two armed colleagues went to his home. Wischhusen appeared to be cooperative, showing the officers around the house but at one point - as an officer's bodycam was to show - he tried to reach into the pocket of a coat hanging on the bannister where the converted pistol had been stashed, only to pull his hand away when an officer turned around. He put the coat on and was allowed to go to an upstairs bathroom where he aimed the gun at his head and fired. The bullet lodged in his head but did not kill him. He came downstairs pointing the gun at the police and was shot three times. He was in hospital for four months. After he was discharged, Wischhusen denied in a police interview that he had an obsession with guns, describing it instead as a passion. Wischhusen's actions have had a lasting impact. One of the firearms officers was clearly very emotional as he described how he thought he was going to die as the gunman came downstairs. Police were so worried about the impact the case would have that staff were only told about Wischhusen hours before his trial began. Those named in the hitlist and his former school have been shocked, the quiet village rocked by the revelation of what was going on behind the front door of an unremarkable semi.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman to discuss the fallout from Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, especially repercussions in the occupied West Bank. The secretary's trip to Jordan, located along much of Israel's eastern border, comes after Blinken spent time meeting with Israeli officials as well as people directly impacted by the attack and war, which has killed more than 1,300 Israelis and at least 27 Americans. Blinken also met with Jordan's King Abdullah II, whom President Joe Biden has been in touch with since the crisis erupted. The Jordanian leader has served as a key mediator in Middle East-related negotiations over several decades. Blinken and Abdullah II discussed the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. They also talked about efforts to secure the release of all hostages and prevent the conflict from widening. Blinken underscored that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination and discussed ways to address the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza while Israel conducts legitimate security operations to defend itself from terrorists, it said. Abbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the West Bank. His Fatah movement is a rival of Hamas, which controls Gaza. Follow live updates from NBC News here. White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said in an interview with MSNBC's Morning Joe on Thursday that the message that Blinken intends to convey to Abbas is to try keep calm in the West Bank because it is in the interest of both Israel and the Palestinians. Things have remained relatively quiet on the West Bank throughout the eruption of this conflict across the border into Gaza, and we hope it stays that way, Finer said. And I believe that President Abbas and Secretary Blinken will discuss how that can be best done, what support we can offer to the Palestinian Authority as they continue to help provide security in the West Bank. Abbas is under pressure from Palestinians because of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government's response to Hamas' attack. The Israeli military on Friday ordered residents of northern Gaza to evacuate south, raising fears a potential ground assault may be imminent. While Blinken met with Israeli officials on Thursday, King Abdullah II spoke with Abbas separately and discussed ways to stop the all-out aggression against our Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian News  Information Agency (WAFA). During their conversation, Abbas called for an immediate end to aggression toward Palestinians and the need to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza as well as water and electricity in the enclave. The news agency said Abbas called for political action to end Israel's occupation but also said that on both sides of the conflict, civilians, prisoners and detainees should be released. Abbas reaffirmed his belief that the Palestinian Liberation Organization is the legitimate group representing all Palestinians; not Hamas, a reminder of how opposed to each other the two groups are. We emphasize the policy of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which renounce violence and adheres to international legitimacy, peaceful popular resistance, and political action as a path to achieving our national goals of freedom and independence, leading to ending the occupation and embodying the independence of our Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 borders, Abbas said in a statement. It is unclear how much influence Abbas might have under the current circumstances, as the PLO and Hamas have largely been adversaries for nearly two decades, with Hamas dismissing all agreements between the PLO and Israel. In a 2006 election, the secular Fatah party of which Abbas serves as chairman lost its majority in the Palestinian territories to Hamas. Hamas took violent control of Gaza in 2007 and, since then, there has been ongoing conflict between Hamas and the PLO. Meanwhile, Blinken, who has been addressing concerns about civilians based in Gaza, said Thursday that he and Netanyahu had discussed possibilities for safe passage for civilians who want to leave or get out of the way in Gaza. That is a conversation a discussion that we will pursue in the coming days, including with some of the countries that we will be visiting, he said. After traveling to Jordan, Blinken is expected to also visit with leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar..",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Our prisons are almost full. Last night the Times reported that 'Lord Justice Edis, the senior presiding judge for England and Wales, has ordered that sentencing of convicted criminals who are currently on bail should be delayed from Monday'. Prisons in England and Wales are now unable to find cell space for every criminal that judges believe should be jailed. This means that next week people convicted of very serious crimes, including historic sex offences, may be found guilty then sent home on bail. Beyond the obvious public protection concerns this delay to justice will further traumatise victims, and reduce confidence in the whole system. Anyone could have predicted this crisis. Last November, Damien Hinds, the prisons minister, activated Operation Safeguard - which makes police cells available to house prisoners for a maximum of one night if no prison cell is available. It is still in use. Our courts system is crumbling In March this year judges were urged to sentence more leniently in light of prison overcrowding. In May, Andrea Albutt, president of the Prison Governors' Association, warned of a 'capacity crisis'. Then the Chief Inspector of Prisons wrote about a prison population 'crisis' in August. The numbers make the problem clear. Over the last year the government has created about 90new prison places per week by making two prisoners share a single person cell, delaying maintenance work, transferring low risk prisoners to open conditions, deploying temporary prison cells, and opening new prisons (once they overcome local planning processes). However, each week up to 200 new prisoners enter the system. The Ministry of Justice blames a 'higher than usual number of offenders coming into prison this year'. Again though, this rise should have been expected. The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised 20,000 additional police officers, and in April of this year the PM announced that this had been achieved. It does not seem surprising that 20,000 more police officers might result in more arrests, but the rest of the system seems entirely unprepared. Similarly, in 2020 the government announced that violent and sexual offenders would spend longer in prison. While protecting the public in this way is popular, the result is further strain on our limited prison capacity. Our courts system is crumbling figuratively and literally and this creates further pressure. Before the pandemic the number of remand prisoners (those awaiting trial or sentencing) was around 9,500. During lockdown, with the courts disrupted, that number rose to around 13,000. While barristers were on strike in 2022 it rose to 15,500. By the end of June this year 15,500 prison spaces were occupied by remand prisoners. In the long-term we need to make prison work, reducing our high reoffending rate so that someone returning to prison become rare. But that work will take years. Right now the government needs to free up capacity in the prison system. This means looking at who can be released early. Home Detention Curfew, or 'tagging' allows low-risk, non-violent prisoners who have displayed good behaviour during their sentence to spend the final months before their conditional release date on curfew at their own homes. At present curfew is only available in the last 180 days of someone is sentence. Increasing this period to nine months, or even 12, would free up a substantial number of open prison spaces. As a result, lower risk prisoners would transfer to open prisons, creating capacity throughout the system. Another option is to adjust sentencing policy, avoiding the use of very short sentences of a few days or months. Much of the public may find this unpalatable if the result is prolific offenders being spared prison. In the same way we struggle to build rail and power capacity it seems we can no longer plan and create enough prison infrastructure. Politicians enact popular, aspirational policies, putting more police on the streets and jailing dangerous criminals for longer, when there is no serious chance of the prison system achieving the necessary capacity. It all feels emblematic of a government and state that has lost its ability to plan or function.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

This is the longest that Congress has been rudderless since 1971, when it took 18 days to elect a speaker. The latest twist in the saga came Thursday night, when Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., withdrew from consideration just a day after being nominated by House Republicans. Scalise, the House majority leader, had been viewed by many in the GOP as the successor to ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The House canceled a vote that was scheduled for Wednesday, and it is unclear when it will meet next or whom the House GOP will put forward next. Democrats are backing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. Upon arriving at the Capitol on Thursday morning, he told reporters that House Democrats were ready to find a bipartisan path forward out of the chaos and dysfunction. It is time for the GOP to end the House Republican civil war, get their act together, so that we can take care of the business that the American people stand strongly for: Our allies throughout the world, including Israel and Ukrainian people, he said. A lack of House leadership could continue to complicate Washington's response to the Israel-Hamas war. Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, expressed similar concerns over the Israel-Hamas war. At this point, I care less who that person is, and more that they are willing to get policy to the floor, he told reporters Thursday. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., emphasized the need for help from Democrats in order to reach the 217 votes. He urged House Democrats to communicate what they need in exchange for helping Republicans. Speaker elections typically happen at the beginning of a new congressional session, and it is extremely rare to have one during the middle of a session There have only been five instances since 1913 in which a midsession speaker election was needed, all of them following either a death or resignation. This is the first time an election will follow a speaker's dismissal, which happened to McCarthy on October 3. Until a new speaker is chosen, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., will serve as speaker pro tempore, an interim role for which he was selected by McCarthy and that contains limited powers to bring bills to the floor.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The House speaker vote is thrown into further turmoil after Steve Scalise's unexpected withdrawal. And when and where to watch the ring of fire solar eclipse this weekend. Here is what to know today: Israel has ordered the entire population of northern Gaza to evacuate south, a warning that leaves more than 1 million people to decide whether to abandon their homes. Hamas urged Gazans to ignore it. Israel's military said the order, which will raise fears of an imminent ground offensive on the densely populated enclave, was intended to minimize civilian casualties in the war against Hamas. But the YOU.N. said it was impossible and risked a disaster. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your morning. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Humanitarian organizations are calling for Israel to reverse its order, with the Norwegian Refugee Council warning that, absent of any guarantees of safety or return, it would amount to the war crime of forcible transfer. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as the YOU.S. grapples with its response to the surprise Hamas attack and the fate of Americans, including some taken hostage. Airstrikes intensified yesterday in Gaza, where more than 1,500 people have been killed and over 6,200 injured. An Israeli siege has blocked electricity, water and other essentials from the region, causing health care systems to reach a breaking point as they grapple with an acute shortage of medical supplies, the World Health Organization said. Authorities in the YOU.S. and across the world were bracing after calls for a worldwide day of rage today in support of Palestinians. Follow our live coverage. House Republicans are expected to meet at the Capitol this morning to nominate a new candidate for speaker after Steve Scalise withdrew from the race yesterday, building further uncertainty in the House more than a week after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. The unexpected decision by House Majority Leader Scalise came after hours of meetings, during which he failed to flip any of his critics to the yes column. To win the speakership, he would have needed at least 217 of 221 Republicans to vote for him on the House floor. Not long after Scalise's announcement, some Republicans said they already have another choice in mind. A Colorado police officer was found guilty and another was acquitted yesterday in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a Black pedestrian whose death set off months of protests against police brutality. Aurora Police Officer Randy Roedema was convicted of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault, and former Aurora officer Jason Rosenblatt was acquitted. Roedema and Rosenblatt detained McClain on August 24, 2019, before paramedics injected him with ketamine. Minutes after he was injected with the sedative, McClain was found to have no pulse and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived but was later declared brain dead and died on August 30. The officer accused of putting McClain in a chokehold is set to go on trial this week. The paramedics who injected McClain will also face trial this year Sky-watchers in Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas, as well as slivers of California, Idaho, Colorado and Arizona are in for a cosmic treat tomorrow, when a solar eclipse will allow people there to witness a rare ring of fire in the sky. But do not worry if you are not in one of those states. You will still have the chance to see the moon take a bite out of the sun. Saturday's eclipse is a much-anticipated event because it is rare for the path of a solar eclipse to cut so cleanly across the continental YOU.S., one expert said.

It said: Strike action in France on Friday 13 October may affect some rail and air services. Check with your travel operator before starting your journey. A demonstration is planned in Paris in the afternoon, moving from the Place d'Italie (in the 13th arrondissement) to the Place Vauban (7th arrondissement). Stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. Many airlines warned passengers to expect delays, the Liverpool Echo reported. On its website, easyJet said: We have been advised of a national strike in France starting 18:00 local time on Thursday 12th October to 06:00 Saturday 14th October. Air Traffic Control staff are joining the strike action and therefore like all airlines, our flights to and from French airports, as well as those flying in French airspace, could be affected. We expect that there will be delays and some disruption due to the industrial action, therefore we advise all customers to check the status of their flight on our flight tracker either on our mobile app or website: www.easyjet.comenflight-tracker Please also be aware that public transport services may be affected by the strike. We recommend all customers allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport and consider alternative transport options where possible. Ryanair said: Due to the French ATC strike on Friday, we have been forced to cancel a small number of flights mainly overflying France. Affected passengers have been notified of their options to change flights (free of charge) or receive a full refund. So far in 2023, there has been 64 days of ATC strikes (over 12 times more than in 2022) forcing airlines to cancel thousands of EU overflights from Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the UK, while France uses Minimum Service Laws to protect French flights. This is unfair. France (and all other EU states) should protect overflights during ATC strikes as they do in Spain, Italy and Greece, and cancel flights tofrom the affected State. Ryanair sincerely apologises to affected passengers for any inconvenience as a result of these French ATC strike disruptions, which are beyond Ryanair's control. Jet2 also alerted passengers of the strike and added: Whilst we are unsure of any disruption this may cause there is a possibility of disruption to flights that are due to operate within French airspace. For us to achieve departures as close to our published schedules, it is necessary for us to close our check-in desks and board flights in line with your flight's scheduled departure time.

Several countries there are central to global oil and gas production. The Hamas terror attacks in Israel have thrust the entire region into a hugely uncertain new era, political and otherwise. Energy market analysts are trying to make sense of what it may mean for global oil prices, which have been on a dramatic trajectory since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. As the world reacted to events in Israel at the weekend, crude oil prices jumped by nearly 5 to 89 (83) a barrel on Monday. Uncertainty around potential supply issues caused the spike, but prices have since settled. Israel produces next to no crude oil, but the potential for the conflict to widen in the Middle East has rattled experts. If it turns into a wider conflict, and that causes oil prices to go up, that does have an effect on the economies, Gita Gopinath, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund, told Bloomberg on Wednesday. That is usually one of the channels through which we see that affecting global numbers. US President Joe Biden has expressed concern about the possibility of the conflict developing into a wider one. 1970s oil crises sparked price jumps The most dramatic oil crises of the 20th century followed conflict in the Middle East. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 saw several Arab states attack Israel. The region's biggest oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, then placed an oil embargo on nations that supported Israel, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. That led to an oil crisis, which saw oil prices jump by more than 300. The second big oil crisis, in 1979, followed the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the subsequent drop in oil production that took place in the country. That crisis saw global oil supply fall by around 4, with prices for a barrel of crude oil more than doubling. So far, there is little to suggest that what has happened in Israel will prompt anything like those crises. Prices are currently well below the figure of 97 a barrel that was reached in late September. Suggestions at that time that the price would soon breach 100 per barrel now look wide of the mark. Both WTI West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent retreated yesterday as concerns of a sudden and unexpected supply disruption have been swept aside for now, Tamas Varga, an analyst with PVM Oil Associates, told Reuters on October 11. Brent crude and WTI are the two most traded grades of oil in the world. Brent crude's price is the benchmark for crude oil in Africa, Europe and the Middle East while WTI's price is the benchmark for North America. The market, however, remains jittery given the potential for the conflict to worsen and spread. Magid Shenouda, deputy CEO of the Swiss commodities trader Mercuria, said Wednesday that the company believes prices could breach 100 per barrel if the situation escalates. Israel important to global gas industry While Israel is not a major oil producer, it is a significant player in the global gas industry. In the wake of the Hamas attacks, the country shut down its Tamar natural gas field, around 25 kilometers (15 miles) off its southern coast. Israel exports large volumes of gas to its neighbors, Egypt and Jordan. The shutdown has led to concerns that global gas markets will become even tighter than they have been recently. Egypt uses Israeli gas for some of its own liquified natural gas (LNG) exports and the shutdown in Tamar may impact Egyptian LNG exports to Europe and elsewhere. However, Israel's largest gas field, Leviathan, continues to operate normally. The uncertainty lies in how long the Tamar field will remain shut down. Experts have said a prolonged shutdown would significantly impact Israeli export volumes to Egypt and Jordan, which would have knock-on effects for global LNG markets due to Egypt's role as an LNG exporter and the potential of import rises from elsewhere to Jordan. The role of Iran in global oil The crisis in Israel comes at a time when global energy markets are already tense, given the ongoing uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine which -- combined with the aftereffects of the pandemic and other factors -- contributed to the wider global energy crisis of 2021-23. Oil prices have come down from the 115 peak they hit in June 2022, despite production cuts from Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). On October 4, a few days before the attacks in Israel, OPEC confirmed it would maintain production cuts until the end of 2023. But even after that news, prices continued on the downward trend they have been on since the end of September. The production cuts by Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia mean there is considerable spare capacity in case oil supply is unexpectedly curtailed. However, there is still uncertainty over how Riyadh may respond, given recent tensions with the US. The role of Iran is being closely watched, too. Although Iranian oil is sanctioned, it has flowed in significant volumes to China and elsewhere recently, easing oil markets in the wake of restrictions placed on Russian oil. However, were Iran to become actively involved in the Israel conflict, pressure would come on the US and others to step up enforcement of sanctions on Iranian oil. For now, the crisis has not extended to global energy markets, but the risk of escalation has put the market on watch. Source: Deutsche Welle",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Police released the sketch Wednesday afternoon based on witness recollections of a man they saw on a recreational trail before finding 77-year-old Honoree Fleming dead with a gunshot wound to the head. She was killed on October 5 about one mile south of Vermont State University's Castleton Campus on the Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail. In addition to releasing the sketch to the public, detectives with the Vermont State Police continue to review potential evidence in the case, including forensic evidence with the assistance of the Vermont Forensic Laboratory at the Department of Public Safety in Waterbury, state police wrote on Wednesday. Police described the person as being a 5-foot-10 male in his 20s with short, red hair. He is considered armed and dangerous. Commander of the Vermont State Police Capt. Scott Dunlap told the Associated Press witnesses saw the man acting odd. He added police do not know if the shooting was random or targeted. The Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail is a 19.8-mile section of former railroad that cuts through scenic countryside with vistas of the nearby hills, villages, farms, fields and forests, according to its website. It is a multiple-use trail open to pedestrians, bicyclists, and horseback riders in the summer, and snowshoers, skiers and snowmobiles in the winter. Vermont State University Castleton campus confirmed that Fleming was a retired dean of education at the university. She previously worked as a faculty member at Trinity College, Middlebury College and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Fleming lived in Castleton with her husband Ron Powers, a Pulitzer Prize-winning and New York Times-bestselling author. The university reopened October 9 and resumed classes on October 10 after closing the week prior following Fleming's homicide. In a Facebook post, Powers said his wife was walking along her favorite trail near the college when she was killed. There is an area-wide dragnet out for her killer, he wrote. Police believe that it was random, but all possibilities remain open. Powers added he was with his son, Dean. Those of you who knew her know that she was beautifully named, he wrote about Fleming. I have never known a more sterling heart and soul than hers. She has taken far more than half my own heart and soul with her. In 2017, Powers wrote No One Cares About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health in America about his two sons with schizophrenia. One of his sons, Kevin, died in 2005.

But you might have to go to Elko, Nevada. On Saturday morning, the moon will pass directly in front of the sun for more than 6.6 million people from Oregon to Texas. But during this rare solar eclipse -- the first of its kind in the Western YOU.S. since 2012 -- the moon is at apogee, or farther from earth than normal. That means it will not appear large enough to completely blot out the sun. Instead, the result is an annular eclipse, also known as a Ring of Fire eclipse for the thin band of the sun that remains visible around the moon. The phenomenon kicks off early. As the sun rises over the West on Saturday, viewers will notice a black disc -- the moon -- slipping over the earth's life-giving star from above as early as 9 a.m. Mountain Time (8 a.m. Pacific Time, 10 a.m. Central Time ). For viewers in the path of totality, inside the antumbra shadow cast by the moon onto Earth, the moon will gradually slide to the center of the sun. The phenomenon will last only a couple minutes before the moon appears to glide off the other side of the sun. People are also reading...

Since the moon never fully shields the sun, special eclipse-viewing glasses are needed for the duration. The rest of the YOU.S. and almost all of North America will be in the penumbra, or a partial shadow of the sun. Viewers in those places will see the moon pass across the sun without perfectly covering its center. Locations closer to the path of the antumbra will see a greater degree of partial eclipse. Viewers in Missoula, for example, will see slightly more than 70 coverage of the sun. Viewers in Buffalo, New York, will see about 25. About 80.7 million people, or roughly one-quarter of the YOU.S. population, live within 300 miles of the path of the eclipse. NASA created an interactive online map for tracking the eclipse path, accessible at svs.gsfc.nasa.govwebappseclipse-explorer. From Oregon to Texas: The viewing path At about 9:17 a.m. Pacific Time, the full Ring of Fire eclipse will begin in Eugene, Oregon, and will last for approximately 3.5 minutes. At that time, the sun will appear at 18 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of 121 degrees, or in the east-southeast sky. By 9:22 a.m. Pacific, the path of total eclipse will wash over Elko, Nevada, where full eclipse will last about 4 minutes. Locations slightly south of Elko, such as Carlin, will get 4.5 minutes. During that time, the sun will appear at 24 degrees above the horizon in the southeast sky. The eclipse will pass over the Four Corners area of the Southwest from 10:30-10:35 a.m. Mountain Time, and will appear at 32 degrees above the horizon in the southeast sky. (Most of Arizona does not observe daylight saving time and is currently one hour earlier than Mountain Time. The Navajo Reservation in the state's northeast corner and around Four Corners does observe daylight saving time and will be on Mountain Daylight Time.) By 11:52 a.m. Central Time, the eclipse will pass over the San Antonio, Texas, area for nearly 4.5 minutes. The sun will appear at 46 degrees above the horizon -- approximately halfway between the horizon and directly overhead -- in the south-southeast sky. From there, the eclipse path will glide off into the Gulf of Mexico. Varying degrees of a slowly diminishing partial eclipse will remain visible for the entire YOU.S. until about 11:36 a.m. Mountain Time. After that, the sun will gradually appear whole for YOU.S. viewers from west to east, beginning with the Pacific Northwest. Southern Florida will experience a partial eclipse until just after 1 p.m. Mountain Time, or 3 p.m. Eastern.

Sarah Wrenfrow, operations manager at Iron Horse RV Park in Elko, said Wednesday that We have been sold out on RV spaces for over a month because of the eclipse. The park boasts 107 spots, slightly more than half of which are open for nightly and weekly stays. The rest of them are home to seasonal or year-round RVers. And there are cabins available to rent. Wrenfrow said it is unusual to be booked solid in October. This weekend, in fact, is the only time this month the park will be full. And they are not the only ones. She said that everyone who has called the park or its affiliated hotel in town has said they cannot find any available lodging in the area. It is my understanding that all forms of lodging in Elko are completely sold out, she said. I heard that Battle Mountain is also sold out. The California Trail Interpretive Center in Elko is hosting an eclipse watch-party starting at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time. Elsewhere, the impacts of the eclipse were not as clear. Melissa Jegglie, who oversees reservations and the campground store at AlbanyCorvallis KOA campground in Oregon, just north of Eugene, said Wednesday that the campground is sold out this weekend. But that is normal, she said, because there is an Oregon State University football game and it is parents weekend at the school. She was not sure if any campers were there for the eclipse. Even without the eclipse we are normally pretty packed, she said. On the southwest edge of San Antonio, a worker at the front desk of Best Western Plus Palo Alto Inn  Suites said Wednesday that the hotel did not see any rise in bookings for the weekend. He was not aware of this weekend's eclipse until two days ago, he said. Eclipse repeat come 2024 Although stunning in its own right, Saturday's eclipse is somewhat of a preview for an upcoming eclipse in spring. On April 8, 2024, a true total solar eclipse -- where the moon fully covers the sun and reveals a corona of plasma around the veiled star -- will sweep across the YOU.S. from Texas to Maine. It will be the first total solar eclipse across the YOU.S mainland since 2017, when the so-called Great American Eclipse briefly turned day into night from coast to coast. San Antonio's northwest side and a swath of Texas immediately west will fully experience both the October 14 and April 8 eclipses. Although this weekend's Ring of Fire eclipse may not result in as much fanfare there, April's total eclipse seems to already be drawing large amounts of hopeful viewers. At the Best Western, we are almost completely sold out for the April 8 total solar eclipse. Those were selling out about a month ago.

Anyone that vacates the right of others to exist peacefully vacates the right of themselves to exist peacefully. When peace is vacated, humanity is vacated. The same is true of hate. Hate never has any justification. When compassion is vacated, so is humanity. There is nothing divine about either terrorism or hate -- both are diabolic. There is no such thing as a Holy War, all war is diabolic. Those who do not accept the diversity of others, do not allow the equality of others, will not treat others equitably, and will attempt to exclude their voice and free will in life, do not deserve to be accepted, do not deserve equality or equity, and do not deserve to have their voice heard or their free will in life abided. There are those among us who want to dominate, subjugate, control, and own others and force them to be the vanity of their own self-image. This is cruelty and not humanity. Acceptance and compassion are the human way and the only humanity will persist. If we do not awaken to this, we will be devoured by a nightmare made real. Robert Moreland, Lexington My father is an 84-year-old Palestinian, born near Bethlehem in 1939 in the town of Battir. He is not a terrorist. He is an electrical engineer. He is a man who escaped the unlivable conditions in Palestine 60 years ago and now watches yet another generation endure unimaginable suffering. He sheltered in caves of Bethlehem for one year in 1948 with his family, as over 500 Palestinian villages were destroyed; the state of Israel was being established. When my father returned to his house, as a 10-year-old boy, his home was standing, yet villages across the railroad tracks were gone. For those many Palestinian families who survived this trauma, yet no longer had homes, camps were established, such as those in the Gaza strip. This is a complicated human catastrophe. The Israel-Palestinian grief remains a constant. The families of Gaza, people marginalized by their mere existence, will not be able to pay for the terrorist attack last weekend. They have nothing to give. They never did. The tragedy unfolding now should be viewed as such. I pray our leaders will be able to see a path out of this seemingly forever failure to establish a plan for peaceful co-existence. Miriam Lightfoot, Lexington Let us hope Israel does not make the same mistake that the YOU.S. made in Vietnam during the incursion into Cambodia in May 1970. Israel's campaign should have no time limits nor limitations on where they can strike or how much destruction they can inflict; they must remove Hamas as an evil in the area. Only with Hamas's elimination can Israel find security and protect her people from future carnage. The American thrust into Cambodia was limited in duration and limited to 30 klicks when it should have been an unlimited deeper thrust. Sanctuaries were destroyed but not totally eradicated as the enemy rebuilt to return later to kill more Americans. It was a partial success. Hopefully, Israel will permanently destroy Hamas as a military, terrorist and political entity, and free the Palestinian people from the reign of terror existing in Gaza since 2007 when Hamas took control. In war, decisive measures of total destruction have proven to bring good results; Rome against Carthage, Genghis Khan against China, Sherman in Georgia and the YOU.S. against Japan. Evil forces only understand the same brutality they inflict on others. With Biden's open borders policies, the devastation seen in Israel is sadly coming to America! Robert Adams, Lexington I noticed that when the Republican candidate for governor, Ky. Attorney General Daniel Cameron, defended himself last week from Gov. Andy Beshear's advertisement regarding his extreme position on abortion, he did not mention anything about the survivor, Hadley, at all. When he was elected attorney general, he promised to do something about one of Kentucky's worst claims to fame: child abuse. In his defense against Hadley's rightful charge against him, Cameron said he cared. He cared about prosecuting the abusive stepfather and seemed to care about saving pregnancy tissue. But in my opinion, he does not care about the lives of pregnant people in Kentucky, a state with inordinately high negative pregnancy outcomes. That is not pro-life. That is using a politicized issue to win political power. Our governor's race with Gov. Andy Beshear running for reelection enjoys national attention. Beshear's popularity is well known as the guy who pulled Kentucky through a pandemic and multiple weather disasters with dignity, caring and respect while enduring constant law suits from Republicans. Frankfort's supermajority was happy wasting taxpayers money on legal fees instead of teacher raises and funding statewide schools. Nothing blew-up against Republicans like voters NO to Amendments 1 and 2: Adding days, collecting more money, power grabbing laws and a Trigger Law abortion ban that failed to include exceptions in the case of rape and incest. Republicans overreaching law touching every female in Kentucky is shocking, cruel and sick. Will voters surprise Republicans again? Beshear needs all five constitutional officers in the same party to work effectively together for even more wealth, success and protections for us. Beshear defied Republicans and won. The state is richer than ever and voters want women to know they will be safe in Kentucky. What a great PR billboard sign it will make. Welcome to Kentucky - Stupid does not live here anymore. Judy Rembacki, Georgetown A recent headline said, Ky. Governor poll shows Beshear with a big lead over Cameron was the best news I have heard in months. Thank you, Kentuckians, for realizing that we are so fortunate to have the one of the best governors in the YOU.S. and for realizing that it is extremely important to keep him for another four years. This is neither a comment on Cameron nor Republicans vs. Democrats, but rather a considered opinion about what is good for Kentucky. Harry Clarke, Lexington With announcements of infrastructure investments of rail, old issues arise. Was infrastructure investment in roads or bridges better than investment for access to fast passenger rail travel, maybe down interstate highway land? Why not invest in safe methods of ride sharing with ID cards and computerized methods for finding drivers going in the same direction? We need to cut down on individual car ownership and our individuals' investments as well as our desperate need for cars. Will we replace the massive number of semi-trucks on the roads, burning diesel and contributing to pollution now? We need to make sure truck drivers are not abused by the change while we think of ways to share work, not just create jobs. It is all a mistake that needs philosophical changes in American social, economic and political thinking. We cannot continue to ravish the earth for momentary pleasures. We cannot set, and advertise to the world, a lifestyle of spend, spend, spend while driving prices of our own simple living here up for many people. The future is not going to be a pleasant task, or sight to live in, for those we are forcing our mistakes on. Don Pratt, Lexington Our news streams are full of political information, opinions and polling results. This is a friendly reminder that our votes get the final say. Please vote. Karen Gerstle, Lexington News flash for Rep. Josh Calloway (R-Irvington) who said, One of the single greatest things we can do to clean up that public education system is to give parents choice and give them the opportunity to choose where they send their child to be educated. Parents already have that choice. But they do not have the right to ask someone else to pay for it. Nor should they. Carole Boyd, Lexington The media can capture hundreds of urban youth of color ravaging high-end stores, shattering store fronts and hauling out thousands of dollars worth of retail goods. Viral videos expose this urban decay for all the world to see. Social media coordinates and facilitates these attacks. Urban density is the perfect venue to display these horrendous events. What we seldom see are the hundreds of thousands of primarily white crimes that includes car thefts, car break-ins, garage thefts, porch bandits, and thefts of catalytic converters, copper, trade tools, farm equipment, guns and even animals. Viral video seldom catches these geographically diverse events. Flea markets fence these items every day without conscious recognition of the fruits of these theft events. We need to give equal recognition to urban, suburban and rural theft. Theft is driven by both poverty and opportunistic greed. Let us recognize theft as an equal opportunity offender.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Russia sent dozens of tanks and armored vehicles and thousands of troops into the assault, which started four days ago. They are hitting with everything they have. Yesterday a lot of armor was used, they came in columns. The assault is not stopping neither day or night, Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka's military administration, said on Ukrainian television. Russia has also launched smaller offensive operations at points all along the front line, intensifying an offensive near the city of Kupiansk, which Ukraine liberated last year, according to Ukrainian troops on the ground. But the main attack is on Avdiivka, which holds major strategic significance for both sides. Avdiivka is located close to Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-occupied Donetsk region. Ukraine heavily fortified the line at Avdiivka prior to Russia's full-scale invasion last year, constructing deep trenches and a system of underground bunkers. As a result, Russian forces have barely advanced near the city. Russia now appears to be seeking to cut off Avdiivka and surround the Ukrainian forces inside its defenses. For the entire time of the war, there has never been such an offensive around Avdiivka, even though they have attacked Avdiivka since 2014, Oleksiy Dmitrashkivsky, chief spokesman for the Command of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, told ABC News. He said two Russian battalions, numbering around 2,000 men and backed by dozens of tanks and other armored vehicles, had begun the attacks, pushing from the northwest and southwest. A massive artillery and air barrage had preceded the assault and has continued since, with frequent strikes on the city itself. So far the Russian assault has appeared to have gone badly, according to Ukrainian military officials and open source researchers tracking the losses. Barabash, Avdiivka's military administration chief, said at least 40 Russian armored vehicles had been lost in two days. Videos circulating online of the attacks appeared to largely support those claims, with some open source researchers saying 30 to 50 Russian tanks and other vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine's general staff claimed over 1,000 Russian troops had been killed and injured since the new offensive operation began. The Institute for the Study of War said Russia had managed to capture roughly 4.52 square kilometers of territory from different directions around Avdiivka in the last three days. Russian forces have not secured any major breakthroughs near Avdiivka as of October 12 and are unlikely to immediately cut off Ukrainian forces in the city, ISW wrote in its daily briefing Thursday. Ukrainian military officials said their troops have successfully held the lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the Russian attackers, though Ukrainian casualties were also large. The new Russian offensive -- the scale of which seemed to catch some analysts off-guard -- nonetheless was significant because it appears to show Russia's attempt to regain the initiative in the war. The Russians have decided that they can already start their own counterattack in the Avdiivka direction, Dmitrashkivsky said. They are taking advantage of the fact that the attention of the whole world is on the events in Israel and they have started an active phase along the entire front line. He said the Russian attack near Avdiivka had involved a mixed force of paratroopers and poorly trained forces, as well as so-called Storm Z units -- detachments of convicts sent to fight. They were very weakly prepared and that showed in their losses, Dmitrashkivsky said. The attack had been exceptionally large, he added, requiring huge efforts from Ukrainian troops to blunt it. Most analysts believe Russia likely still lacks the manpower to make significant gains in an offensive, including around Avdiivka. But the push indicated Russia hopes to further blunt Ukraine's counteroffensive with its own counterpunch, coming as the weather starts to worsen. Ukraine is continuing to press its own attacks in the southern Zaporizhzhia region where its counteroffensive is focused and around the city of Bakhmut.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Senior Divisional Commercial Manager (Dhanbad rail division), Amresh Kumar said, The man, identified as Harvinder Singh, is being interrogated. Prima facie, it appears that he was in an inebriated state when he opened fire. A Railway Protection Force (RPF) official said the accused had a ticket for the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express. But he boarded the Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express on Thursday evening at Dhanbad railway station by mistake. After boarding the train, Singh had an altercation with the coach attendant over a seat. During the argument, the retired Army personnel opened fire from his revolver, said the RPF official. As he opened fire, RPF personnel on the train seized the pistol immediately. The accused was arrested at the Koderma railway station, PTI reported. Earlier in July, an RPF jawan shot dead four persons on a train en route to Mumbai from Jaipur. The accused was identified as Constable Chetan Kumar Choudhary. He fired his automatic weapon the the train and killed an RPF Assistant Sub-Inspector along with three other passengers, reported PTI. A senior police officer said that the accused was mentally unstable. The senior cop said, He accused opened fire on his escort duty in-charge ASI Tika Ram Meena in the running train, reported The Mint. The officer added that after killing his senior, the constable went to another bogie where he shot dead three other passengers.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Luton Airport said Terminal Car Park 2 cannot be accessed safely so it is unable to confirm the condition of any individual vehicle at this time. Up to 1,500 vehicles remain in the car park, with the debris of some cars piled up within its blackened structure. Steve Amos, who has a vehicle inside, said: We have been left to our own devices. The airport has offered no help at all. We do not know when we are going to have a car again or how we are going to get home now. Mr Amos, who flew into Luton Airport on Friday from Palma, Mallorca, said there has been a total lack of any proper information from airport authorities. They have not helped the poor people that have come down to try to collect their cars. Nobody's out here giving them information He said he was astounded to hear Bedfordshire's chief fire officer say earlier this week that the car park, which opened in 2019, did not appear to have a sprinkler system. A taxi driver at the airport who saw the fire on Tuesday night criticised Luton Airport's response. They have not helped the poor people that have come down to try to collect their cars. Nobody's out here giving them information, he said. The driver, who did not wish to be named, also criticised the lack of sprinklers in the car park. He added: There is a lot of questions that need to be answered about fire safety. He said it was scary to see cars exploding and estimated he lost at least 14 hours of work after the taxi rank was shut following the fire. In a statement, London Luton Airport apologised to customers with vehicles in the car park, which is a five-minute walk from the airport's terminal. We cannot confirm the condition of any particular vehicle at this time, but we recommend that you alert your insurance company immediately It said: We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car parking customers, and that many are still anxious for more detail. We are sorry that we have not been able to respond as quickly as we would have liked. We are working with Apcoa Parking and the Motor Insurers' Bureau who will co-ordinate with the various vehicle insurance companies. Apcoa Parking said in a statement: Terminal Car Park 2 is closed. The fire has caused extensive damage to the car park and there is currently no access to the site. We cannot confirm the condition of any particular vehicle at this time, but we recommend that you alert your insurance company immediately.

In a new warning, it said that both air and rail services could be impacted. It said anyone travelling should check with the travel operator before starting the journey. It said: Strike action in France on Friday 13 October may affect some rail and air services. Check with your travel operator before starting your journey. A demonstration is planned in Paris in the afternoon, moving from the Place d'Italie (in the 13th arrondissement) to the Place Vauban (7th arrondissement). Stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. The strikes could hit fans travelling to the continent as the Rugby World Cup reaches the quarter-final stages. Wales have a big match on Saturday against Argentina, with England playing Fiji on Sunday. Many airlines warned passengers to expect delays, the Liverpool Echo reported. On its website, easyJet said: We have been advised of a national strike in France starting 18:00 local time on Thursday 12th October to 06:00 Saturday 14th October. Air Traffic Control staff are joining the strike action and therefore like all airlines, our flights to and from French airports, as well as those flying in French airspace, could be affected. We expect that there will be delays and some disruption due to the industrial action, therefore we advise all customers to check the status of their flight on our flight tracker either on our mobile app or website: www.easyjet.comenflight-tracker Please also be aware that public transport services may be affected by the strike. We recommend all customers allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport and consider alternative transport options where possible. Ryanair said: Due to the French ATC strike on Friday, we have been forced to cancel a small number of flights mainly overflying France. Affected passengers have been notified of their options to change flights (free of charge) or receive a full refund. So far in 2023, there has been 64 days of ATC strikes (over 12 times more than in 2022) forcing airlines to cancel thousands of EU overflights from Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the UK, while France uses Minimum Service Laws to protect French flights. This is unfair. France (and all other EU states) should protect overflights during ATC strikes as they do in Spain, Italy and Greece, and cancel flights tofrom the affected State. Ryanair sincerely apologises to affected passengers for any inconvenience as a result of these French ATC strike disruptions, which are beyond Ryanair's control. Jet2 also alerted passengers of the strike and added: Whilst we are unsure of any disruption this may cause there is a possibility of disruption to flights that are due to operate within French airspace. For us to achieve departures as close to our published schedules, it is necessary for us to close our check-in desks and board flights in line with your flight's scheduled departure time. Check-in will close 40 minutes before your scheduled departure, and we will board your flight on time in order to get you on your way as quickly as possible.

No new strikes were announced Friday, but autoworkers in the Greater Cleveland remain out of work, either because they are on strike or were laid off by the automakers. Fain said in a livestream to UAW members that the strike has moved into a new phase, which started on Wednesday, when 8,700 workers went on strike at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant without a prior announcement. The UAW has been using a new targeted strike strategy where they pick key facilities to strike at each automaker. Before, the strikes were announced a few hours in advance. Fain said automakers were trying to avoid strikes by making new offers right before his livestreams were scheduled on Fridays. But because of this, he said they were not making offers throughout the week. A negotiation requires both sides making movement, Fain said. If they are not going to move, we are going to give them a push in a language that they can understand, dollars and cents. More than 100 UAW members at the Stellantis parts warehouse in Streetsboro went on strike Sept. 22. Ford has laid off 372 employees at the Cleveland Engine Plant in Brook Park. And 130 workers were laid off at General Motors' Parma Metal Center. Another 184 workers have been laid off at the Lima Engine Plant as well. Ford said Thursday night 16,600 of its workers are now in strike, and another 1,920 have been laid off.

Long before Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel on Saturday in an unprecedented breach, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's grip on power was in peril. Netanyahu, on trial for corruption, and his far-right coalition had faced eight months of widespread protests over a judicial overhaul that critics said was pushing Israel toward autocracy. Now, after attacks that have left more than 1,300 Israelis dead, many Israelis are seething, deeming the security and intelligence failures a fresh set of reasons why their leaders must be stripped of power. In some cases, the fury has erupted into public confrontations between Israeli citizens and government ministers in the days since the attacks. You are responsible! Go home, one Israeli woman shouted through tears at Idit Silman, an Israeli cabinet minister, as she visited a hospital treating wounded from the attack this week. Yet even some of Netanyahu's harshest critics are holding off on pushing for his government to be kicked out immediately, wary of provoking more instability at a time when the Israeli public and its military are most vulnerable. Josh Drill, a prominent leader in the protest movement, spent much of the past year rallying Israelis to rise up against Netanyahu's government, arguing that Israel was barreling towards becoming a dictatorial regime. But in the days since the attacks, many of the protest organizations have redirected their focus to collecting food for displaced Israelis and equipment for soldiers called into service, said Drill, a former Israeli military officer. Our main objective is to win the war, Drill said in an interview. But when it comes to Netanyahu's future, he added cryptically: We understand what needs to happen the day after the war. In the midst of crises that shake a nation's core sense of stability, political leaders historically tend to see a boost in popularity, as anxious citizens rally 'round the flag. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, then-President George W. Bush's approval rating surged to 90, the highest ever recorded in Gallup polling. So far, it is unclear whether Netanyahu will receive any such boost, especially as many Israelis are publicly blaming his government for failing to detect Hamas' elaborately planned attack in advance -- and questioning whether he instead was distracted by his campaign to force through controversial judicial changes. In an apparent bid to mollify any mass defection by the public, Netanyahu on Wednesday announced he would formed a wartime unity government that includes Benny Gantz, a chief political rival. The people are united and today its leadership is also united, Netanyahu said. We have put aside every other consideration because the fate of our country is at stake. Yet with grieving Israelis demanding answers for what went wrong, there were signs that even some of the prime minister's allies felt compelled to own up to the shortcomings. Education Minister Yoav Kisch, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, acknowledged in a striking interview Thursday that he and Israel's government bore responsibility. We were busy with nonsense. We would forgotten where we live, Kisch told the Israeli news outlet Ynet. But, he added: Now is not the time to deal with this. Others in Israel's military and political leadership have similarly conceded that the government and its security agencies fell short when it mattered most, even as they suggested the time for accountability would come later. Mark Regev, a senior Netanyahu adviser, told NBC News' Andrea Mitchell that obviously there was a mishap but said the time for investigations would come when this is over. IDF is responsible for the security of our nation and its citizens, and we failed to do so, Herzi Halevi, the military chief of staff, told reporters on Thursday, using an acronym for Israel's military. We will look into it, we will investigate, but now it is time for war. At the same time, the Israeli public's exasperation over that deadly failure is increasingly spilling into public view. Nir Barkat, the economy minister and longtime Netanyahu ally, was confronted during his own hospital visit by angry Israelis who shouted where were you? videos posted on social media show. And Silman, the environmental protection minister, was chased out of the hospital by a man in medical scrubs who blamed her for paving the path to Israel's current government -- and, by extension, its security predicament. In 2022 Silman played a major role in former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's downfall when she resigned from his coalition, forcing Bennett to lose his governing majority and clearing the way for Netanyahu's return to power. Now it is our turn! Get away. We will help, the man shouted, slapping his hands together as Silman exited through the ambulance bay. You have ruined this place, now go away from here!",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

As Allison and Rebecca Kestenbaum stood in front of a building in Greenwich Village on Wednesday, they were thinking about another set of sisters: their relatives Celia and Bess Eisenberg, who, as teenagers, worked at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Bess called in sick on the day that a horrific fire tore through the garment factory. Celia died, along with 145 others. The tragedy transformed US labor law and the building that housed the factory, now a New York University science building, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003. But until this week, there had never been a permanent memorial paying tribute to the fire's victims. One was unveiled Wednesday at the site of the factory on the corner of Washington Place and Green Street near Washington Square Park. The memorial was conceived by the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition, a nonprofit group of descendants and labor advocates dedicated to preserving the memory of the mostly Jewish and Italian immigrant women who died that day and the fire's impact on the organized labor movement. It is remarkable to see people showing up who maybe did not have a connection but who feel moved by it, said Allison Kestenbaum, who brought her two children to the unveiling from their home in San Diego. This triggers emotions for a lot of people and opens our eyes to something that so many did not know anything about. According to the story that is been passed down through in the Kestenbaum family, Celia, just 17, went to work alone on March 25, 1911, a warm Saturday. Near the end of the workday, a cigarette butt ignited fabric scraps inside the factory, on the ninth floor of the Asch Building. As the flames began to spread, the women who worked there found that they had been locked in from the outside by management, who wanted to prevent the workers, who made roughly 7 a week, from stealing inventory as well as keep out union organizers. The fire was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in New York City history. A long awaited memorial The memorial, in the making for more than a decade, includes a massive stainless steel ribbon that floats horizontally along the edge of the building -- the names and ages of the victims are cut out of the ribbon. A stone panel underneath the ribbon reflects the names back to the viewers and also bears quotes from witness and survivor testimonies. On Wednesday, the reflective stone panel was also adorned with 146 white roses in honor of the victims. It is getting some really beautiful reactions, Uri Wegman, who, along with Richard Joon Yoo, was one of the two architects of the memorial, told the New York Jewish Week. You never know how people are going to respond and I feel like we are accomplishing exactly what we designed the memorial to do, to transport and reorient people to the events of the tragedy, the Israeli-born architect said. Over the next few months, a vertical steel column will be installed to showcase the height from which workers jumped in a futile attempt to escape the flames. The Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organizes an annual event on the anniversary of the fire, in partnership with Workers United, the New York City Central Labor Council, the FDNY and New York University. I have waited a really long time to say three words to you -- three powerful words, and three extraordinarily sweet words: We did it, said Mary Anne Trasciatti, the president of the coalition, at Wednesday's unveiling ceremony. By honoring the Triangle workers with this memorial, we are making a statement about the dignity and humanity of every worker, past and present. We are showing our support for baristas, auto workers, nurses, teachers, farm workers, warehouse workers, coal miners. Unions from around the city and beyond -- including the International Ladies Garment Workers, the Steamfitters Union, the Laborer's International Union, Actor's Equity, United Automobile Workers and the SAG-AFTRA Union -- sent representatives to the unveiling ceremony. At the ceremony, labor organizers reminded the crowd about how the fire jumpstarted labor reforms and workers' rights efforts, including activism and legislation that led to safety protocols, workers' compensation, a 40-hour work week, minimum wage and pensions. They also used the opportunity to speak about workers' rights today, pledging continuing support for the Hollywood actors' and United Auto Workers strikes. The Triangle fire -- with its large number of Jewish, Eastern European immigrant victims -- also galvanized the Jewish community, which had an already active labor base, Ann Toback, the chief executive officer of the Workers Circle, told the New York Jewish Week. Founded in 1900 as a fraternal organization to help Eastern European immigrants adjust to American society and workplaces, the Workers Circle was a central base for Jewish labor activists. In 1909, it helped organize an 11 week long general strike consisting of 20,000 young Jewish women in the shirtwaist industry. One of the only holdouts of the strike was the Triangle company. After the tragedy in 1911, Jewish union organizers Clara Lemlich and Rose Schneiderman marched from the site of the tragedy to Cooper Square to demand new changes and more organizing. It did spark a new outcry of activism and The Workers Circle at that time was very much a center of labor activism, Toback said. Jewish labor activists and Workers Circle members were also at the forefront of expanding the membership and organizing power of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, which became one of the country's largest labor unions after the fire. The Workers Circle was a sponsor of the victims' memorial at the site of the factory. In remarks, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul shared that her grandfather, uncles and father worked in coke ovens at the Bethlehem Steel plant, itself the site of multiple fatal industrial accidents. I am so proud to be part of this effort to honor the names of those who were lost in that horrific inferno, Hochul said. She called New York the birthplace of the workers' rights movement because of what happened right on this block. New York State allocated 1.5 million in state funds to build the memorial. Hochul, who has been trying to maintain support for immigrants as the city struggles with the recent influx of nearly 125,000 migrants, connected the fire to the present day. Our workers deserve to be protected and we will fight to make sure they have those rights, Hochul said. This state is so great because of the immigrants, the migrants who came here. Let them work. We need them. Julie Su, the Acting US Secretary of Labor, also addressed the crowd. We can imagine the black plume of smoke up in the air, the flames that spread from floor to floor, the panic of the workers who ran and found closed exits and broken fire escapes, she said. Their cries for help and then the thud of bodies as they began to jump one after another. Allison Kestenbaum said she has always felt a strong connection to her relative and other victims of the fire. I went to NYU. If I had been there two generations earlier, an immigrant, I would not have had the opportunity to go to college -- I would have been a seamstress in a sweatshop, she said. It also relates to what is going on in our present and our future, she added. The story and everything that came after is known throughout our country and in so many parts of the world for the tragedy and for all the changes that it inspired and continues to inspire. It is very meaningful.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

What is this toxic chemical?,"Israel's relentless attack on Gaza continues. Since the start of the conflict last Saturday after Hamas's stealth attack, the Israeli military has dropped 6,000 munitions on the enclave, every 30 seconds. The death toll in the strip has climbed to more than 1,400. There has been growing speculation that both sides have committed war crimes. Amid this, a rights group has accused the Israeli forces of using white phosphorus. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions in its military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, saying the use of such weapons puts civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury, according to a report by Reuters. While the Israeli military has launched retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, it is also fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran. Do not miss: Our special coverage from Tel Aviv on the Israel-Hamas war Human Rights Watch claims that verified videos taken in Lebanon on 10 October and Gaza on 11 October show multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border. It provided links to two videos posted on social media that showed 155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles being used, apparently as smokescreens, marking, or signalling. Both show scenes near the Israel-Lebanon border, it said. They did not post a video of the use of the munitions in Gaza but Palestinian TV channels have broadcast videos in recent days showing thin plumes of white smoke lining the sky over the Hamas-controlled enclave. We explain what this dangerous chemical substance is and how it has been used in conflict in the past. What is white phosphorus? White phosphorus is a toxic chemical, which burns at more than 800 degrees Celsius, which is high enough to melt metal. Often yellowish or colourless, this wax-like chemical substance, some say, smells like garlic. It is used as a weapon in conflict and is deployed in the form of bombs, grenades, rockets or artillery shells, according to a report by Al-Jazeera. White phosphorous munitions are made after combining a mixture of white phosphorus and rubber. Since the chemical ignites instantly in contact with oxygen, its function as a weapon is to burn, fast and bright. It is used by militaries around the world, including Israel and the United States, to illuminate targets as part of tracer munitions at night. White phosphorus weapons are also used to create smokescreens during the day, as they release a huge amount of smoke when burned. The smoke lasts for close to seven minutes. This is why phosphor remains one of the fastest ways to make highly dense and effective smoke screens, according to Dan Kaszeta, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, the UK's leading security and defence think tank. Who can broker peace between Israel, Hamas? Can India help? Israel-Palestine conflict: Why India cannot afford to take sides How a drawn-out Israel-Hamas war could hurt the Indian economy How Sanjeev Singla, India's envoy in Tel Aviv, is assuring the safety of nationals in Israe How dangerous are white phosphorus munitions? White phosphorus burns human skin and disintegrates tissues inside the body. It ignites when exposed to oxygen and continues to burn until it is deprived of oxygen or it is exhausted, reports Al-Jazeera. The toxic chemicals are absorbed by the body and because multiple organs like the heart, liver and kidneys to dysfunction. The burns have a double effect - they have a local effect because of the burn itself which is generally quite severe and very deep, and then the second effect is metabolic, which can kill the patients, Roman Hossein Khonsari, professor of maxillofacial surgery and plastic surgery at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris told Al-Jazeera. According to Khonsari, who worked during the Armenia-Azerbaijan war, if doctors are unable to identify that burns are caused by white phosphorus and the victim does not receive necessary treatment, they face a risk of organ failure. Experts say that white phosphorus sticks to many surfaces, including skin and clothing, and is difficult to wash off. Inhaling the fumes can be lethal, leading to severe irritation to the eyes and making them sensitive to light. Exposure to the chemical can also result in facial paralysis and seizures. White phosphorus is not banned in wars by international conventions. It has been categorised as incendiary weapons designed to set fire to objects or because burn or respiratory injury to people through the action of flame, heat, or combination thereof... under Protocol III in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), signed in Geneva and enforced from 1983. However, its use as an incendiary weapon has been banned in areas with civil population. There is one loophole in the restrictions though. Incendiary weapons launched from the ground are governed by less strict guidelines than those dropped from the air. Israel and the US are not signatories to Protocol III. They claimed to use white phosphorus in line with international regulations. Has Israel used white phosphorous in Gaza? Israel's military said it was currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza. It did not comment on allegations of their use in Lebanon. However, this is not the first time Israel has been accused of using the highly combustible substance in Gaza. According to HRW, the Israeli Defense Forces used white phosphorus during a 22-day conflict, Operation Lead Cast, in Gaza, which lasted from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009. The Israeli military repeatedly exploded white phosphorus munitions in the air over populated areas, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital, HRW said in its 2009 report. Back then, the Israeli military first said that it used white phosphorus to mark targets but later denied using it. Israel said it had launched its investigation which proved that the use of white phosphorus was for operational needs only. Based on the findings at this stage, it is already possible to conclude that the army's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law... These shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law, the Israeli army had said in a statement.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

His work has previously appeared in Entertainment Weekly, Variety, BuzzFeed, Reader's Digest, Backstage, Creative Screenwriting Magazine, The Drill Mag, Script Magazine, Ocala Magazine, and The Kansas City Star. One officer was killed and another was wounded during a shooting at the Philadelphia International Airport on Thursday evening, according to police. Interim Commissioner John Stanford told NBC 10 and Fox 29 during a news conference that the two off-duty airport officers were arriving to work in the parking garage just after 11:00 p.m. He then explained that they exited their vehicles and observed a few individuals breaking into another vehicle within the parking garage area. The officers approached to essentially disrupt and investigate what is going on, Stanford continued. At that point, the suspects opened fire on the officers, striking one of our officers multiple times in the upper torso, striking the other officer in the arm. One of the officers was taken to the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center at 11:34 p.m., where he was pronounced dead. He was 50. The other officer, 60, was first taken to the Methodist Hospital before being transported to Jefferson Hospital. He was listed in stable condition, it was confirmed during the news conference. The unidentified officer who died was with the police department for 22 years and also married with a child, Stanford shared. He added: As you can imagine, they are heartbroken and devastated that their family member is not coming home tonight.

The interim commissioner described one possible suspect as being transported by a private vehicle, but could not confirm whether that individual was involved. The shooting prompted the closure of the airport's Terminal D, along with the parking garage for Terminals D and E, shortly after 11 p.m., Heather Redfern, the city's Department of Aviation spokeswoman, confirmed to PEOPLE. Additionally, five planes kept passengers onboard for about 30 minutes. Redfern also confirmed that access to the garage was fully restored at about 7 a.m. Friday morning. Anger, devastation and heartbreak are the emotions, Sanford wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter). One officer gave his life tonight and one is recovering. Please wrap your arms and prayers around their families and our department. We will continue our search for those responsible and will not stop until all are in custody.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Across the country, people begin to stir. They pour their cups of coffee, they butter their toast, and they turn on the news. Boris Johnson has won the 2019 general election for the Conservative party, with a thumping majority of 80 seats. The Labour party of Jeremy Corbyn is in utter disarray, with their so called red wall of seats in northern England in pieces, replaced by a corresponding blue wall of Conservative MPs. The question over why the red wall crumbled will haunt journalists for years to come- was it because of Brexit? Was it a fear of Corbyn? Was it a distrust in Labour over the economy? Was it the promise of levelling up? If the fall of the red wall was for any of those reasons, then the voters who switched from Labour to Conservative must be severely disappointed. Brexit has arguably been a failure- the oven ready deal that Johnson campaigned on in 2019 did not exist and the flourishing economy that voters were promised is now in the shackles of a cost-of-living crisis affecting millions. Even Brexiteer-in-Chief Nigel Farage admitted on Newsnight that Brexit has been a failure (of course, he still believes in the because, but the admission speaks volumes), and I am sure that the 3 million people who were recipients of a food bank parcel last year would agree. Voters who feared Corbyn and how he would handle the economy must be laughing- after 49 days of a Liz Truss government, a Corbyn economy must seem like utopian bliss. Arguably, the promise of Johnson to level up is why so many of the red wall voters switched over to the Conservatives. Whether or not you believed in Brexit, the promise of billions being invested into deprived areas was an appealing policy. Part of the levelling up agenda announced in 2019 included a commitment to invest in Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester with a focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle as part of a 100bn National Infrastructure Strategy. These rail connections relied on an existing and ongoing rail project, High Speed Two (HS2), but as all major parties had committed to this in 2010, voters did not appear concerned that Northern Powerhouse Rail, or even HS2, would not be able to go ahead. Levelling up was happening, and people were turning out in their dozens to vote for Johnson's Conservative party. HS2 is the high-speed rail network that was planned to link London and major cities in the north and the midlands. Proposed in 2010, the line was meant to connect London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, but in 2021 the Leeds leg was scrapped over concerns surrounding the rising cost of the project, and during the Conservative Party Conference in October 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the line between Birmingham and Manchester was going to be abandoned in favour of spending the money on local infrastructure. What was once a revolutionary project, designed to link London with the north via high-speed rail, and create hubs between major northern cities, is now a journey from Birmingham Curzon Street Station to London Euston. He has said that the line will run up to Manchester, just not at high speed like the initial promise. HS2 has failed. The dreams of high-speed rail linking the country is just that. A dream. A dream that has cost the government 100 billion, and that is not including the cost of the trains. How has the government of a G7 country failed so horribly at something that should be so simple- France has just commissioned 203 miles of high-speed rail starting in Bordeaux, and this is estimated to cost 12 billion. That is double the length of the London to Birmingham route, at just 12 of the cost. So why has HS2 been so expensive compared to other countries? The answer is simple- a large amount of the route that HS2 takes cuts through marginal Conservative constituencies, and so the residents must be consulted, and MPs must be appeased. Additionally, the cost of building supplies has increased with inflation and the war in Ukraine, and the actual building of tracks and creating tunnels is expensive. Despite these factors, the fact that it has taken a government nine years to get the building of 330 miles of railway tracks underway is shameful, and the lack of this railway network will be felt across the country. The lack of HS2 will be felt most notably in the north of England, as the proposed project of Northern Powerhouse Rail relies on a section of track between Manchester and Liverpool being shared with the HS2 line. Now that HS2 is not being built, the lack of this section of the line throws the future of Northern Powerhouse Rail into question. Even if Rishi Sunak is promising 36 billion in transport infrastructure for the north, this does not answer the question of how this issue is going to be solved. It also does not fix the fact that these plans have been in the works for years, and he has let down the north, again. As Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said at a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference, This will be remembered as the conference when they pulled the plug on us. What gives them the right to treat people here in Greater Manchester and the north of England as second-class citizens?. Sunak is not only facing criticism from members of the Labour Party- the Conservative politician Andy Street said at an impromptu press conference that Sunak will be turning his back on an opportunity to level up - a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Burnham and Street are right. People of the north have consistently been treated as second class citizens, and it speaks to the wider views of the Conservative government that they are cancelling a project that would create a powerful northern economy, one that could potentially grow to provide huge benefits for the country. This let down of the north is potentially going to be what costs Sunak the general election- if you were promised levelling up in 2019, why on earth would you believe in anything else the Conservatives promise you? The cancellation of HS2 is not levelling up by any stretch of the imagination. This is not the country that those red-turned-blue-wall voters were promised in 2019. This is an abject failure by a government that is tumbling down in the opinion polls, trying to grasp onto anything that might save them. Scrapping HS2 will not be their saving grace. True investment in the north means ensuring that levelling up is not just a campaign slogan but is something that people can point to and say that it was a genuine success. Levelling up was always meant to be about giving funds where they were most needed- if HS2 is not deemed worthy, other causes must be found.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Relief measures were initiated immediately after the incident, with ambulances and doctors rushing to the site. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav issued a statement saying that the departments of disaster management and health have been asked to take immediate steps to ensure the quickest possible relief to as many people as possible.

Late on Wednesday night, a tragic incident occurred when several coaches of the Delhi-Kamakhya Northeast Express derailed near the Raghunathpur station in Bihar's Buxar district, resulting in the loss of at least four lives and leaving 30 passengers injured. This mishap led to the diversion of 92 trains and the cancellation of eight others. The unfortunate derailment happened when the train was running one hour and 40 minutes behind its scheduled time. The impact of the derailment was severe, causing damage to pillars, electrical poles, signal posts, and both tracks at the accident site. Consequently, several trains on the New Delhi-Howrah main line were delayed as they were held at different locations. Initial assessments by officials point to the possibility of poor track maintenance or a fault in the track-changing mechanism as the likely causes of the derailment. It is worth noting that the area in question is not known for any unlawful activities. This incident is a grim reminder of the significance of rail safety and infrastructure maintenance. It occurred just months after a rail disaster in Odisha's Bahanaga Bazar, which resulted from faulty connections in the automated signaling system. In that tragic event on June 2, 288 people lost their lives, and over 1,000 were injured when a passenger train collided with a stationary freight train and subsequently derailed, hitting another passenger train traveling in the opposite direction. Authorities have identified three of the deceased passengers in the Bihar accident as Usha Bhandari (33 years old), Akriti Bhandari (8 years old), and Abu Jayand (27 years old), while the identity of the fourth victim is still to be determined. Most of the injured passengers are currently receiving treatment at hospitals in Buxar, Ara, and Patna. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has pledged to investigate the root because of the derailment and was expected to visit the accident site. The relief and rescue teams promptly reached the scene, ensuring the evacuation of all trapped passengers and the efforts to reposition the derailed coaches on the tracks. The East Central Railways' chief public relations officer, Birendra Kumar, confirmed that a technical committee is investigating the technical aspects of the derailment. He noted that three coaches sustained the most damage, and compensation has been provided to the families of the deceased, with injured passengers also receiving compensation.

Vale of Glamorgan Council has confirmed that there are still no buses set to service the transport project in Barry, Wales. Barry Transport Interchange, situated outside Barry Docks Railway Station, was developed to improve connectivity in the Vale and so far includes a taxi rank, bike shelters and bus stops. The leader of the Plaid Cymru group at Vale of Glamorgan Council, Cllr Ian Johnson, called the project in its current state a waste of public money. Bus companies across Wales are struggling at the moment due to reduced funding and recovering passenger numbers following the Covid-19 pandemic, WalesOnline writes. Many services have recently been changed or cut altogether. Cllr Ian Johnson said: Vale of Glamorgan Council officers have done very well in ensuring that the bus station has been built, but there is no point in a bus station with no buses. He added: There is nothing new about the drop in passengers following Covid-19, and that was known well before the construction of the bus station earlier this year. This is a major multi-million pound project that will not be used at any time soon for the reason it was built. That is a waste of public money at a time when the Labour Council are telling us to get ready for large scale cuts. Construction on phase one of Barry Transport Interchange started in January, 2023, and electric car charging points will soon be connected to the site. Adventure Travel's number 88 bus service was originally supposed to take passengers to and from the new interchange, but it has since been withdrawn. Vale of Glamorgan Council said in April that Cardiff Bus was considering which of its services could operate at the interchange. The company later announced that it was also withdrawing and making changes to a number of its services from September and no services were shown to be set to operate at Barry Transport Interchange in updated timetables. At a Vale of Glamorgan Council meeting on September 25, Cllr Ian Johnson asked what conversations cabinet members were having with other authorities and the Welsh Government with regards to ensuring that revenue funding is found for bus services in the future. In response, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for neighbourhood and building services, Cllr Mark Wilson, said: We have regular meetings with our fellow cabinet members to discuss this and we lobby Welsh Government, along with other local authorities, to get a bigger chunk of available funding. A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesperson said: Unfortunately, the interchange has been completed at a very difficult time for the bus industry. Reductions in government funding, reduced post-pandemic passenger numbers, and a shortage of drivers have all contributed to reductions in bus services. In the short term the new interchange will be used for Transport for Wales rail replacement services while upgrades to the local train network are undertaken. The council is also in discussions with local bus providers to see if the new interchange can be incorporated into any existing routes. In the long term, as new residential developments in the area are completed, we anticipate that there will be a commercial interest from the local bus operators that currently serve Barry and we still expect the interchange to come into regular use. This is only one aspect of the council's work to support bus services in the Vale. Since April, the council has increased spending on local bus services by more than 100,000, taking our total investment this year to around 500,000. This funding has been used to provide bus services where companies do not operate on a commercial basis, including the rural Vale, and to pay operators to run services that we know are valued by the community in the evening and on weekends.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

This week, Sadiq Khan warned that the possibility of bedbugs on London's public transport was a 'real source of concern'. He said that he had contacted officials in Paris after the French capital became overwhelmed by an outbreak with the insects reported in schools, trains, hospitals and cinemas. Many fear that bed bugs have made their way over to the UK, as people have spotted them in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Now, Richard Grimes, Managing Director and Pest Control Expert at Acorn Environment Services, has revealed how you can banish the insects from your home. Has your house been infested by bed bugs? Please email: tipsdailymail.com Richard Grimes, Managing Director and Pest Control Expert at Acorn Environment Services, has revealed how you can banish the insects from your home He said: 'Bed bugs are not picky and they can very easily hitch a ride on our luggage or clothes, making it incredibly easy for this infestation to find its way to the UK. 'That is why it is so important for Brits to have the information they need to protect themselves and their homes.' While bed bugs may seem small and harmless, they can soon take over your whole house. For some, their bites are uncomfortable, showing up on skin as itchy red bumps as they feast on human and animal blood. Mr Grimes said that bed bugs have 'a reddish-brown, flat, oval bodies and leave itchy bites that are either in a line or clusters.' He recommends that Brits remove the clutter from their homes and avoid storing items on the floor. The pest expert said that those struggling with an infestation should wash bedding and clothing at a high temperature. 'Bed bugs and their eggs cannot survive at temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius, so high temperature washes and tumble drying for at least 30 minutes can help to kill them off,' said Mr Grimes. Rik Smith, director of tenancy services at Goodlord, has also issued a series of tips to tenants worried about their bugs - ranging from the extreme to the bizarre. If you are concerned that you may have brought the bugs into the house, Mr Smith says you should 'put affected clothes and bedding in the freezer for a few hours before washing'. You should also take steps to 'wash bedding and clothes on a hot wash (at least 60C) and tumble dry on a hot setting for 30 minutes'. When that is done, it is important to hoover the house thoroughly and empty the bag - as the bugs may still be alive in there. Bedbugs are seen in a sofa bed in L'Hay-les-Roses near Paris, France, last week He explained: 'They are incredibly small - 5 to 7mm long - and it is easy for them to get into a home without anyone noticing. 'Considering the bugs can live for up to six months without food, one of the most difficult problems people face is the fact they are so hard to remove - and may only be noticed when there is a full infestation.' A pest control company which operates in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and London has said that staff are facing 25 call-outs a week, which is up from just 'one or two' a month ago. Luton is a particular hotspot for bedbugs at the moment, with residents throwing their beds away, ripping up carpets and evacuating their homes. Luton Council's website this week warned residents it 'does not have limitless resources' to tackle the 'obnoxious pest', adding treating properties was 'not free'. It said: 'The national bed bug problem has not missed Luton. The Pest Control Service is currently receiving an alarming number of bed bug jobs on a weekly basis.' Adam Warren, director of Summit Pest Control, told The Times that the problem had flared up in the past six weeks and that Luton was 'busier for bedbugs than I have ever known it'. As the company face a busy time of year, they said the worst infestation was in the affluent village of Radlett, Hertfordshire, where an elderly couple's house was so infested they had to rip out the carpets and throw the beds away. The Times also spoke to Jamie Ramsey, manager of Pests of London, who said they were 'snowed under' with bedbug call-outs at the moment. They serve areas within the M25. Britain's bedbug infestation is said to be getting worse with pest-control teams revealing they are the busier than ever. Pictured: A bedbug outbreak on bedding Fears are growing of a bedbug outbreak in the UK - similar to that seen in France over recent weeks. Pictured: Specialists on a bedbug call-out A bedbug is seen on a glove of a biocide technician from Hygiene Premium in Paris on September 29 The company's call-outs have doubled since last year to around five to ten a day - many from hotels concerned that guests were bringing them to rooms. A third firm, Pest Extractors, said they have seen a recent spike too - not just in Luton but all over, including Stevenage, another hotspot. The spike comes as it has also emerged that insurers will not pay out over bedbug infestations. Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, and other firms who provide home cover have confirmed the cost of removing bedbugs or repairing damage is not included in most policies. The Association of British Insurers urged customers to look if there was any additional cover they could get as fears grow over an infestation. Cover is likely to vary between home insurance policies, with many not covering the cost of damage caused by vermin and pests,' a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'The costs of disinfestation might be covered under some add-ons to cover, like emergency home assistance. So, the advice on this is to check the cover provided under your policy.' Aviva said its standard home insurance policies exclude 'moths, vermin, insects, fungus, damp, rust, wet or dry rot'. Admiral said it also excluded damage and that its Home Emergency add-on would not cover bedbugs. Axa also said it would not cover bedbugs. Transport for London (TfL) has begun disinfecting Tube seats on a daily basis to stop infestations. Britons have been sharing several videos of suspected bedbugs on social media as fears grow Video shows a backstreet in Marseille filled with home furnishings abandoned during the crisis But experts fear Brits heading to Marseille for England's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Fiji on Sunday could bring the insects back with them. One rugby fan told MailOnline she plans to 'actively avoid' sitting on public transport and has started having 'nightmares' about bedbugs after watching videos of the critters on social media. Nic Shacklock from Online-Bedrooms said: 'It is estimated over a million fans are heading to the Rugby Village. 'If everyone is using public transport while Paris is gripped by a bed bug infestation, it is more than likely an outbreak is heading to our shores.' What are bedbugs, how do they spread and how do you get rid of them? Bedbugs are oval-shaped insects with six legs that can reach up to 7mm in lengthThe parasites originated in the Middle East and have been around for at least 3,550 yearsThey feed on blood and their bites can leave skin rashes and because allergic reactionsDespite their Latin name being Cimex lectularius which means 'bug of the bed', the insects can be found in many hidden crevices such as sofas and cushions as these are safe places to lay their eggsThe pests can live for several months without a blood meal, meaning they can linger in furniture and suitcases for long after their last biteCommon signs you might have bedbugs include: Rusty or reddish smears on your sheets, dark spotting from dried bedbug fecal matter, a musty smell in your roomBedbugs can spread via light switches and electrical outlets and be brought into homes by latching on to luggageWhile bedbugs because itching and a lack of sleep, they are not known to spread disease and bites normally clear up within two weeksExperts recommend not unpacking clothes when staying in hotels and keeping luggage off the floor and zipped upTo get rid of bedbugs, experts recommend washing bedding and clothing on a 60C cycle or packing it in a plastic bag and leaving it in the freezer for three or four days He added: 'It is worth placing bin bags or thick plastic bags on seats while using the Metro as they do not like to cling onto smooth plastic materials. 'We also advise being cautious when you arrive at the hotel room. Check under your bed sheets and strip the entire room as the bugs can be hiding within the mattress and on the sofa.' Professor Lucy Easthope, who has worked on the response to global events including the 911 and 77 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and Covid-19, has warned that Britain is 'not ready' for an invasion of bedbugs. The French government is battling to contain a bout of nationwide panic, with several secondary schools closing due to the infestation. Footage shows residents walking past discarded mattresses in one of the streets in Marseille and Lyon, with some of the items lying in the road and others propped up against buildings. Locals are also chucking out their home furnishings because of the issue, with a placard reading 'bedbugs' pinned to the headboard of a bed to warn others not to take it. Concerns have grown over a bedbug infestation in London after a video went viral over the weekend of what was claimed to be a bedbug on a person's leg on the Victoria line. But some experts have disputed whether the creature is indeed a bedbug, with one saying it was not 'flat enough' and another saying that the clip 'looks wrong.' Mr Khan said he was concerned, but TfL was doing everything it could to ensure the bedbug infestation in France does not spread to public transport in London. He told PoliticsJOE: 'This is a real source of concern, right? People are worried about these bugs in Paris causing a problem in London. 'I was in contact with TfL last week and this weekend. We are taking steps to make sure we do not have those problems in London, in relation to regular cleaning of not just the Tubes and our buses, but talking to the Eurostar as well. 'TfL have one of the best regimes to clean our assets on a nightly basis. We are speaking to our friends in Paris to see if there are any lessons to be learned. For a variety of reasons we do not think those issues will arise in London - but no complacency from TfL.' TfL has confirmed that it is monitoring trains and buses for any indication that the infestation could have reached the UK. The entrance to the UGC Odeon cinema, where a worker claims to have found bedbugs, in Paris A TfL spokesman said: 'We are continuing to closely monitor our network but are not aware of any outbreaks in London. 'We are continuing to implement our rigorous and thorough cleaning measures that have been proven to keep both the interior and exterior of our trains clean. 'We are committed to providing a clean and safe environment on our bus, Tube and rail service for our customers and staff, and we would like to reassure our customers that we continue to maintain our already high standards of cleanliness, so our staff and customers can use the network safely and with confidence.' QA What is the problem? Bedbugs are no strangers to the UK but there have been concerns about sightings in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Pest control firm Rentokil says infestations have soared 65 per cent over the past year. Why is Luton affected? The Bedfordshire town, as with London and Manchester, is a major international transport hub. Planes fly to French cities including Paris, the epicentre of an outbreak, Lyon and Nice. Luton is also within the London commuter belt. How is France hit? Scenes of discarded mattresses around Paris indicate the scale of the issue. There are also reports of infestations in seats and soft furnishings in public buildings and mass transport systems. MP Mathilde Panot recently took a test tube filled with dead bedbugs into the Paris parliament to highlight the problem in 'hospitals, schools, workplaces, retirement homes, prisons, trains and cinema theatres'. What can we do? Bedbugs are difficult to have removed. They are so small they can get inside mattresses plus folds in fabrics and clothing. Treating an infestation in a house can cost 600 to 800 for an average three-bed house - though multiple treatments are often needed. The process is also disruptive as beds need to be stripped and wardrobes, drawers and shelves emptied with contents sealed. Occupants also must leave the property. How do I treat bites? These can be uncomfortable and itchy and may lead to swelling but usually not worse - with an extreme and life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, being a rare side-effect. They generally subside after about a week but measures can be taken to reduce discomfort, such as putting a cool, damp cloth on the affected area and avoiding scratching. Antihistamines or a mild steroid cream can also help.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Honoree Fleming, 77, was discovered dead on 5 October on a hiking trail near Vermont State University Castleton Campus, where she used to work. The sketch was based on witness descriptions of a man they saw enter the trail before her body was found. The killing has shocked the small town of Castleton, Vermont. Police say the suspect is a 5ft 10in (1.78m) white male with red hair who seemed to be in his 20s. They say he wore a dark grey T-shirt and a black backpack and is armed and dangerous. There was more than one witness that observed this individual just prior to coming across Miss Fleming's body, Vermont State Police Captain Scott Dunlap told a news conference on Wednesday. He said without elaborating that the potential suspect was observed to be acting very strangely. It is unclear if the shooting was targeted or random. Officials did not release any other details about the case, which has been ruled a homicide. The Burlington Medical Examiner's office determined Ms Fleming died from the gunshot wound to the head.

She was attacked while on her regular afternoon walk last Thursday along the Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail, a 20-mile (32km) section of former railway that is used by pedestrians and cyclists. Ms Fleming was the dean of education at Vermont State University before she retired in 2012. In a statement on Facebook, the college said more police would patrol the campus. The university said Ms Fleming was beloved by faculty, staff and students. A professor of education and biochemist, she was still publishing academic papers on cellular biology. Her contributions to education and her impact on our campus will live on in all of us, the college said. Ms Fleming lived in Castleton with her husband Ron Powers, who in 1973 became the first television critic to win a Pulitzer Prize.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The derailment took place at 9:53 pm, and the severity of the accident was evident as at least two AC III Tier coaches had toppled over, while four other coaches had jumped off the tracks, as shown in television visuals. Buxar Superintendent of Police, Manish Kumar, confirmed the loss of four lives in this unfortunate accident. Meanwhile, an official from the Railway Police Force reported that a minimum of 70 passengers had suffered injuries and were promptly transferred to local hospitals for medical attention. Those with more severe injuries were immediately rushed to AIIMS, Patna, for specialized care. Incidents like this underscore the importance of railway safety measures and the need for ongoing efforts to prevent such tragic accidents in the future. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has expressed his commitment to uncovering the root because of the derailment of the North East Express. In his statement, he extended his condolences for the tragic loss of lives in this unfortunate incident. He confirmed that the evacuation and rescue operations have been successfully completed, and all coaches involved in the derailment have been thoroughly examined to assess the extent of the damage. The 23-coach 12506 North East Express embarked on its journey from the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi at 7:40 am on Wednesday, destined for a nearly 33-hour journey to Kamakhya, situated about six kilometers away from Guwahati. An eyewitness, Hari Pathak, described the event, stating that the train was traveling at a normal speed when a sudden, loud sound was heard, accompanied by a plume of smoke rising from the train. On investigation, it became apparent that the train had derailed, with the AC coaches sustaining the most damage. This incident highlights the urgency of understanding the causes of such accidents to prevent their recurrence in the future and improve rail safety. Television reports provided a harrowing glimpse of the disaster scene, with local residents swiftly coming to the aid of passengers who were trapped in at least two of the overturned coaches. Their courageous efforts involved helping the passengers escape from the wreckage. Among the passengers, one woman was notably in a state of shock, and she was assisted by compassionate locals. The visuals also depicted the presence of several police officials who played an active role in the rescue efforts, working tirelessly to assist passengers in need. According to the Chief Public Relations Officer of the East Central Railway zone, Birendra Kumar, the accident unfolded less than half an hour after the train had departed from Buxar station, en route to its destination in Ara. The prompt and heroic response of the locals and the assistance of law enforcement officials were instrumental in mitigating the severity of the incident and ensuring that passengers received the help they urgently required during this distressing event. The Railway Ministry spokesperson mentioned that the derailment occurred in the vicinity of Raghunathpur station, a location where the train does not have a scheduled stoppage. This emphasizes the unpredictability of such accidents, as they can happen even in sections of the track without designated stops. After the derailment, relief measures were promptly initiated, demonstrating the swift response of emergency services. Ambulances and medical personnel were dispatched to the site to provide urgent medical attention to the injured passengers. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav expressed concern and issued a statement in response to the tragic incident. He instructed the departments of disaster management and health to take immediate action to provide the fastest possible relief to as many affected individuals as possible. This reflects the government's commitment to ensuring that those affected by the accident receive the necessary assistance and support during this challenging time. The government has taken significant steps to manage the situation and provide assistance to the affected passengers in the aftermath of the train derailment. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav stated that he had communicated with the district magistrates of Buxar and Bhojpur, with clear instructions to reach the accident site promptly and expedite relief efforts. This immediate response reflects the government's commitment to helping those impacted by the incident. To address the needs of the passengers affected by the derailment, railway officials have put alternative arrangements in place. A scratch rake, which has a configuration similar to the original train, was dispatched from Patna to transport passengers from the accident site. Additionally, six buses were deployed to evacuate passengers safely from the scene, and another rake was arranged from Ara to assist stranded passengers in continuing their onward journeys. Medical teams were swiftly dispatched to provide necessary medical attention to the injured, and the district administration in Buxar town alerted local hospitals to be prepared to receive those requiring medical care. The railways also established emergency helpline numbers to assist passengers. These helpline numbers are 9771449971 (Patna), 8905697493 (Danapur), 8306182542 (Ara), 8306182542, and 7759070004, ensuring that passengers could seek assistance and information. In addition, war rooms have been set up to closely monitor the situation and facilitate the early restoration of the derailed coaches. Ongoing rescue operations have been described as operating at full capacity, with a dedicated focus on passenger safety and well-being. The incident's impact on train operations is significant, with at least 18 trains on the route, including the Rajdhani Express running between Delhi and Dibrugarh, being diverted to manage the situation and ensure passenger safety.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Heavy downpours began affecting London last night, with Victoria station on the London Underground part closed today due to flooding. Eastbound Circle and District line trains were not stopping at the station during the morning rush hour. Tube passenger Martin O'Keefe tweeted this morning: 'I do not know how this godforsaken country ever thought it could deliver HS2 when the UK's current rail infrastructure will not even allow half the trains on the Circle and District Line to stop at London Victoria due to flooding. Absolutely pathetic.' Nearly three inches of rain could fall in parts of southern England and Wales over today and tomorrow - with the Met Office warning of possible travel delays. A yellow weather warning for rain was imposed over all of southern England, the West Midlands and the whole of Wales from 9pm tonight until the end of tomorrow - with up to 1.2in (30mm) in two hours and 2.8in (70mm) over the 27-hour period. Early this morning, the mercury dropped to -2C (28F) at Katesbridge in Northern Ireland and -1C (30F) at Eskdalemuir in Scotland, where snow on the mountains is possible in the coming days - as well as a widespread overnight frost across the UK. This weekend, lows of -3C (27F) in Scotland and Northern Ireland could lead to air frosts while cities of England will drop to 2C (36F), potentially colder in rural areas. It comes after Britain enjoyed its longest run of consecutive October days above 25C (77F) since 1959, with four recorded between Saturday and Tuesday. Sunday was the UK's warmest October day in five years as temperatures hit 25.8C (78.4F) in London. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: 'On Wednesday night, there may potentially be some frosts and much colder than average conditions, which might be a shock for northern parts of Britain because we have had this relatively warm air across most of the UK. There will be an increasing tendency towards cooler conditions, however in the southern parts of England and Wales we have got the prospect of heavy rain coming in.' 'We are saying there is a significant rain warning from 9pm on Thursday through to midnight on Friday, and we can expect 20mm (0.8in) to 30mm (1.2in) in some places in a couple of hours. Even up to 50mm (2in), 60mm (2.4in) or possibly up to 70mm (2.8in) across the high ground of Wales, these are significant amounts. Once that warning expires, we have got another shift in our weather pattern where we are getting a more northerly flow coming in. That will introduce much cooler conditions, six degrees below average, which given the fact a few days ago we were talking about conditions six or so degrees above average, will feel like a marked contrast. We have got the prospect on Saturday of early frost in some sheltered northern areas, even some snowfall over the Scottish mountains.' The warning over flooding in England and Wales coms after Scotland was battered by heavy rainfall last weekend, causing flooding and leading to train cancellations and road closures. Some railway stations flooded, with tracks under feet of water. On Tuesday night, the body of a man was recovered from the River Tay in Newport-on-Tay, Fife, after a major search operation. His identity and age are not known, but it was not connected to the search for missing Struan Robertson, 77, who was swept away by floods as his helpless wife Patricia watched on. The family of Struan Robertson, 77, who owns the Pitcastle Estate in Strathtay, Perthshire, fear he has lost his life. Mr Robertson was engulfed by the swollen River Tay and dragged downstream by the powerful current as he tried to clear a clogged hydropower device. Also along the River Tay, caravans and tents were pictured under water at Aberfeldy Caravan Park in Perth and Kinross. Elsewhere, ten motorists were airlifted to safety on Saturday due to landslides on the A83 in Argyll and Bute, which dislodged 2,000 tonnes of debris. Another four were airlifted in Kilmartin, Argyll and Bute. The A83 between the Rest And Be Thankful and Inveraray was closed for work to remove debris from landslips, but has since reopened. Six further landslips were identified as a result of the work, Bear Scotland said. Meanwhile, farmers across Scotland suffered millions of pounds worth of losses in unharvested crops after a month's worth of rain fell in just 24 hours. High-value produce including turnips, broccoli and potatoes were destroyed in the weekend deluge, with the agricultural industry fearing it has suffered one of its worst ever losses. Thousands of acres of farmland remain under water, with some farmers losing entire fields of crops, including 350,000 worth of swedes at a farm Perthshire. But conditions were beautiful in southern England over the weekend, with the Met Office saying 25.8C (78.4F) at Kew Gardens in London on Sunday was the highest October temperature since 26.5C (79.7F) was recorded at Donna Nook, Lincolnshire, in 2018.

Barry Transport Interchange, situated outside Barry Docks Railway Station, was developed to improve connectivity in the Vale and so far includes a taxi rank, bike shelters and bus stops. But the Vale of Glamorgan Council has said there are still no buses stopping there. The leader of the Plaid Cymru group at Vale of Glamorgan Council, Cllr Ian Johnson, called the project in its current state, without a bus servicing it, a waste of public money. Bus companies across Wales are struggling at the moment due to reduced funding and recovering passenger numbers following the Covid-19 pandemic, reports WalesOnline. Many services have recently been changed or cut altogether. Cllr Ian Johnson said: Vale of Glamorgan Council officers have done very well in ensuring that the bus station has been built, but there is no point in a bus station with no buses. Read more: North Wales forest with 'secret waterfalls' and eerie lodge rated UK's best for autumn walks Read more: 'Bully' Welsh nightclub bouncer broke customer's jaw in 'brutal beating' He added: There is nothing new about the drop in passengers following Covid-19, and that was known well before the construction of the bus station earlier this year. This is a major multi-million pound project that will not be used at any time soon for the reason it was built. That is a waste of public money at a time when the Labour Council are telling us to get ready for large scale cuts. Construction on phase one of Barry Transport Interchange started in January, 2023, and electric car charging points will soon be connected to the site. Adventure Travel's number 88 bus service was originally supposed to take passengers to and from the new interchange, but it has since been withdrawn. Vale of Glamorgan Council said in April that Cardiff Bus was considering which of its services could operate at the interchange. The company later announced that it was also withdrawing and making changes to a number of its services from September and no services were shown to be set to operate at Barry Transport Interchange in updated timetables. At a Vale of Glamorgan Council meeting on September 25, Cllr Ian Johnson asked what conversations cabinet members were having with other authorities and the Welsh Government with regards to ensuring that revenue funding is found for bus services in the future. In response, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for neighbourhood and building services, Cllr Mark Wilson, said: We have regular meetings with our fellow cabinet members to discuss this and we lobby Welsh Government, along with other local authorities, to get a bigger chunk of available funding. A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesperson said: Unfortunately, the interchange has been completed at a very difficult time for the bus industry. Reductions in government funding, reduced post-pandemic passenger numbers, and a shortage of drivers have all contributed to reductions in bus services. In the short term the new interchange will be used for Transport for Wales rail replacement services while upgrades to the local train network are undertaken. The council is also in discussions with local bus providers to see if the new interchange can be incorporated into any existing routes. Sign up for the North Wales Live newsletter sent twice daily to your inbox In the long term, as new residential developments in the area are completed, we anticipate that there will be a commercial interest from the local bus operators that currently serve Barry and we still expect the interchange to come into regular use. This is only one aspect of the council's work to support bus services in the Vale. Since April, the council has increased spending on local bus services by more than 100,000, taking our total investment this year to around 500,000. This funding has been used to provide bus services where companies do not operate on a commercial basis, including the rural Vale, and to pay operators to run services that we know are valued by the community in the evening and on weekends.

In closing arguments Wednesday, attorneys for the city said developer Phil Tagami and corporate partner Insight Terminal Solutions failed to meet key deadlines in the construction of a large marine terminal that would ship bulk goods at the former Army Base in West Oakland. Tagami, however, contends that the city intentionally stalled the project in order to prevent the transport of coal through the harbor -- having failed once before to ban coal from passing through Oakland altogether. The pollutant has proven to be politically toxic in Oakland. Environmental advocates have warned for years that coal dust mixed with the open air could worsen West Oakland's air quality. The ensuing legal and public fight has put construction of the terminal on hold since it was first approved about a decade ago. The city knew that its contracts with the plaintiffs in applicable federal law allowed the plaintiffs to (ship) coal, said Tagami's lawyer, Barry Lee. For political -- rather than legal -- reasons, city leaders refused to accept that outcome. With the eight-week trial now wrapped, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Nol Wise will make a ruling in the coming weeks after assessing a complicated timeline of contract negotiations, agreements and delays. The key arguments rest on the idea of force majeure, a common legal clause in contracts that prevents either party from being held liable when a sudden event -- such as a change in the law -- interrupts the agreement. Danielle Leonard, an outside counsel representing the city, said Wednesday that Tagami lagged behind on building the terminal because he was hunting for a sublease that could subsidize some construction costs. She cited testimony from former Mayor Libby Schaaf and other city officials, who said during the trial that they wanted to see the project move forward. There is simply no evidence of a city political conspiracy to block the terminal, Leonard said, because that is simply not what happened. She added later that the delay was due to Tagami's economic self-interest. Judge Wise will consider an exhaustive set of evidence that shapes the timeline of how the contract fell apart, along with the two sides' wildly different characterizations of the documents. At one point, the two sides disagreed whether some railway improvements made by Tagami's team indicated that he was trying to reach his milestones, or if that bit of infrastructure was irrelevant to the original development agreement. The terminal in question, if it is ever built, would store bulk commodities that arrive by rail from Utah -- where the state legislature has dished out 53 million for the Oakland coal project -- before shipping them overseas. The facility would only store coal, and not burn it, but environmentalists have pressured Oakland to divest entirely from the pollutive industry. A study in Richmond this year found that rail conveyance of coal increased the number of fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5, in the atmosphere because of how coal dust mixes into the air. Emergency room visits or hospitalizations for asthma, meanwhile, are two times higher in West Oakland than the rest of Alameda County, according to a 2018 county study, which activists have ascribed to poor air quality. The larger issue of whether Tagami can ship coal was already decided in 2020 when a court determined the city had not provided enough evidence to ban the transport of coal over health concerns. And while the latest lawsuit centers around the technical details of a contract dispute, its larger implications could effectively determine the future of coal in Oakland -- a focal point of the closing argument by Tagami's attorney. The city simply said, 'You are not going build this terminal, Lee said, 'because we know once you build it, coal could be handled -- and that is politically unacceptable.'",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Overall, the accident led to 95 trains being diverted, 31 cancelled and two rescheduled. Also read: Fault in tracks likely because of derailment, says initial probe The accident comes months after errors in the automated signalling system led to the Coromandel Express colliding into a stationary goods train, with some of its bogeys then crashing into the onrushing Yeshwantpur-Howrah Express in Odisha's Bahanaga Bazaar, leaving 296 dead and over a 1,000 people injured in what was India's worst rail disaster for two decades. The accident on Wednesday night, however, preliminary investigations suggested, was caused by a rail fracture. The train that originated from Anand Vihar Terminal in New Delhi was on its way to Kamakhya Junction in Assam, and was running 40 minutes behind schedule when passengers inside felt a sharp jolt at 9.51pm on Wednesday, just after it passed the Buxar railway station. While 23 bogeys were derailed, all four passengers who died were travelling aboard coach B7, a third AC bogey, and M2, a third AC economy bogey. The dead were identified as Usha Bhandari (33) and her daughter, Akriti Bhandari (8), both from Delhi's Mehrauli; Abu Jayand (27) from Kishanganj; and Narendra Kumar (27) from Rajasthan who worked as a community health centre officer at the Bihar Health Society in Begusarai. Usha Bhandari's husband Deepak, who was travelling with his wife and their twin daughters, said, They had gone to wash their hands after dinner when the train derailed. They were thrown out of the coach. He said he suffered minor injuries and that his second daughter is safe, but distraught. At the site in the morning, pillars, electrical poles and signal posts lay strewn, amid a mass of upturned coaches and wrecked tracks. At least 17 bogeys were completely off the rails, with three coaches lying on their side. Pradeep Kumar, a passenger from Hisar in Haryana, said he was sleeping on the side lower berth of AC-3 coach but woke up in the hospital. I was going to New Jalpaiguri for a medical exam of the Shashatra Seema Bal (SSB) and boarded the train from New Delhi, he said. Another passenger, Kartik Yadav from Satna in Madhya Pradesh, said most of the passengers were either asleep or preparing to go to sleep when the accident took place. The jerks were so strong that many fell down from their berths. Some were trapped under luggage. The jerks continued for 10-15 minutes before the train stopped and by that time, it was clear that there was an accident; the lights also went off, he said. The first responders to the scene of the accident were local residents from Rajpur, Kaithi, Pokhraha and Baswar villages under Raghunathpur police station area who emerged from their homes with ladders, ropes, torches and did what they could to help. Video footage from the spot showed them entering coaches and helping people out, and responding to cries of help. Most passengers seemed like they had sustained head injuries. We first looked for people trapped as they were wails and cries all around, said a local tea vendor. Officials at the Raghunathpur Community Health Centre (CHC), where the injured were first brought, said more than 70 people came to the hospital through the night. Thirty-eight people were treated for minor injuries at the CHC itself, and 31 others were sent to AIIMS Patna, the government hospital in Buxar and Ara, said retired Colonel Gopal Krishna Yada, medical officer in charge of Raghunathpur CHC. On Thursday morning, however, Birendra Kumar, central public relations officer of Eastern Central Railways, in a statement said four people were killed and 25 suffered minor injuries in the incident. At least 10 people were sent to the trauma centre of AIIMS Patna, 98 kilometres away. Six of them have minor injuries, one has a femur fracture, one has a rib fracture, one condylar fracture and one has cervical fracture, said AIIMS executive director DR GK Pal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to express his grief. Pained by the loss of lives due to the derailment of a few coaches of the North East Express. Condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for a quick recovery of the injured. Authorities are providing all possible assistance to all those affected, he said. Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote on the micro-blogging site: Deepest condolences for the irreparable loss. Will find the root because of derailment. Senior railway officials said a relief and rescue train reached the site at 1.30am and 1,006 passengers were sent onwards in their journey. The Railways will give compensation of 10 lakh to families of the dead while those critically injured will be provided 2.5 lakh, and those with minor injury will be given 50,000 each, Birendra Kumar said. The Bihar government also announced a compensation of 4 lakh for the deceased. I am pained at the mishap.

All 21 coaches of the North-East Express train, on its way to Assam state from New Delhi, derailed near Raghunathpur railroad station in Buxar district of Bihar state, Magistrate Anshul Agarwal said. Two of them overturned and rested on their sides. Local residents rushed to the scene and helped passengers exit the derailed coaches. Ambulances later arrived and hospitals were alerted to receive injured passengers, police officer Deepak Kumar said. D.K. Pathak, a railroad official who was on the train when it derailed, said most injuries occurred in one of the derailed coaches. The because of the derailment is being investigated. Early reports said 70 passengers were injured. Agarwal said 31 of the injured were hospitalized. Others were able to go home after medical attention. The rescue work was over by Thursday morning with all passengers accounted for, he added. Cranes and gas cutters were used to clear badly damaged railroad tracks. The train was coming at a normal speed but suddenly we heard a loud sound and saw a plume of smoke rising from the train. We rushed to see what happened. We saw that the train had derailed, the Press Trust of India cited Hari Pathak, a person living in the area, as saying. In June, India had one of the country's deadliest rail crashes involving two passenger trains that killed more than 280 people and injured 900 others. A malfunction with the signal system was found to have caused the accident. Most train accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment. In August 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst train accidents in the country. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people.

Moreover, coaches M1, B7 capsized, M2 partially capsized, B1 and H1 coaches tilted and one general coach partially tilted, said the second official quoted above. A third official in the know of the matter appeared to point at gaps in track maintenance. Some of the preliminary observations have revealed that the tracks were longitudinally broken near Raghunathpur station, he said. He also said that the train was running at full speed when the incident took place. The accident spot is around 90 km away from Buxar station and the train was running at 128 kmph when it derailed, he added, requesting anonymity. Shri Prakash, a former member of the Railway Board, explained that no small gap could have caused such a major accident. Rail fracture is usually seen during early mornings when there is a sudden drop in temperature. The Railways conducts a visual inspection once every 24 hours to check for any fractures, especially during winters. However, no hairline crack can lead to such a derailment, he added. The accident came months after errors in the automated signalling system led to the Coromandel Express colliding into a stationary goods train, with some of its bogeys then crashing into the oncoming Yeshwantpur-Howrah Express in Odisha's Bahanaga Bazaar, leaving 296 dead and over 1,000 people injured in what was India's worst rail disaster in two decades.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

At its last stop, near the Chinese border, brand-new residential towers rise out of the jungle. China funded much of the glistening new infrastructure that has transformed this landlocked country of 7.5 million people. The building boom showcases the kind of modernity China says it can offer the world, notably the high-speed Laos-China railway that in a feat of engineering transformed a two-day journey across the country into a sleek three-hour trip. The line was built by Chinese engineers to Chinese rail standards, allowing it to connect to China's high-speed network. But Laos is also an economy in distress. Inflation rose to more than 41 percent at its peak this spring. The Laotian kip has depreciated more than 43 percent against the YOU.S. dollar. In a country where virtually everything is imported, the statistics translate into sacrifice: farmers who can no longer afford fertilizer, children who have dropped out of school to work and families cutting back on health care. The China-led strategy was meant to protect Laos from these shocks -- instead, it led to them. Laos is struggling to repay the billions it borrowed from China to fund the hydroelectric dams, trains and highways, which have drained the country of foreign reserves. As repayments drag, external debt is rising, a vulnerability exacerbated by the pandemic and rising global fuel and food prices. The AidData research lab at William  Mary, which tracks China's lending, calculates Laos's total debt to China over an 18-year period starting in 2000 to be at 12.2 billion -- about 65 percent of gross domestic product. Add in loans from other agencies and countries, and Laos's debt stands at more than 120 percent, according to AidData. There is no country in the world with a higher amount of debt exposure to China than Laos. It is a very, very extreme example, said Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. Laos went on a borrowing spree and got in over its head. Laos has had to make compromises, including on its own sovereignty, to appease Beijing and seek some financial forbearance, allowing Chinese security agents and police to operate in the country as Beijing extends its repression beyond its borders, according to human rights groups and Lao activists. The Laotian electrical grid is now partly controlled by China, in what analysts believe is a trade-off in lieu of debt repayments. A Chinese company provides security for the new train line. China also faces difficult choices. It cannot let Laos default, as Beijing's regional strategy rests on success here. The rail line cutting through Laos is intended to extend into Thailand and Malaysia, and then Singapore, creating a network at the heart of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's ambitions. Laos is also one of the few relative success stories for China, at a time where its Belt and Road Initiative is shrinking or being reevaluated elsewhere, forcing Beijing to focus on its most strategic goals -- integrating its closest neighbors among them. Laos is the ticket to be closer to Southeast Asia, said Toshiro Nishizawa, a professor at the University of Tokyo who specializes in economic and development policy and has advised the government of Laos. Beijing has so far been very generous by allowing Laos to defer payments, Nishizawa added, but it cannot postpone the problem indefinitely. Debt forgiveness to countries like Laos will also open up China to similar requests from governments around the globe. Beijing has loaned almost 1 trillion to developing nations in the past two decades, a mammoth amount that has fundamentally reshaped China's position in the world. We are now getting acquainted with China as the world's largest debt collector, said Parks at AidData, something that is uncharted territory for both the borrowers and China. It is challenging not to let this affect your diplomatic relations, Parks said. The Laotian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for the Laos-China Railway Company Ltd. referred questions to the Laos Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Laos and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent via email and fax. Riding the new Chinese-built high-speed rail from Vientiane, the capital, to Boten, and then back down to the tranquil tourist town of Luang Prabang, revealed a landlocked country torn between a recognition of its limitations -- no progress would have been possible without China -- and deeply anxious about its reliance on Beijing. Lao people have begun to express unprecedented discontent online, targeted at China and their own government, rare in a one-party socialist state where critics are harassed and even disappeared. Lao on social media most recently expressed outrage at reports in late August that a Chinese mining company had detained some 50 villagers for illegally digging gold in a part of northern Laos where the company held a concession and demanded a ransom for their release. Laos is so indebted to China that the Chinese can come over here and take our land, said Nin, a 23-year-old vegetable and condiments seller at a local market in Vientiane, who like other Lao spoke on the condition of anonymity or only with their first name for fear of retribution. Chinese companies, she said, can use Lao workers however they please. Surveys show a remarkable shift in sentiment away from China to other Asian and Western nations -- most surprisingly to the United States, which rained some 270 million cluster bombs down on Laos during a covert campaign in tandem with the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. This year's State of Southeast Asia survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore saw a majority of respondents from Laos, almost 60 percent, say they would prefer the region to align with the United States over China, a sharp reversal from the previous year's survey. A growing number of respondents, more than 72 percent, also indicated they were worried about China's economic influence. When Laos developed a vision for itself as the battery of Asia, hoping to export electricity primarily generated by hydropower, it looked north to China for support. Chinese companies arrived to build dams and supporting infrastructure. Other Chinese businesses followed, making large-scale investments in mining, agriculture and telecommunications. In 2013, China became the largest foreign investor in Laos with some 5 billion spread across 745 projects, overtaking Thailand. The high-speed railway from the Laotian capital of Vientiane to the border town of Boten and then into Yunnan province in China became the signature project in this new relationship, despite warnings from economists about the debt Laos was taking on to build it. The commercial rationale for the railway was also weak, according to a report by the Asian Development Bank, with costs outweighing benefits even if the line eventually connected to Malaysia and Singapore. Seventy-five tunnels, 167 bridges and 6 billion later, the single-track railway opened in December 2021. Chinese state media made a special effort to highlight one of the most challenging technical aspects of constructing the railway: clearing unexploded ordnance left behind by the United States during its bombing campaign. A columnist from the Chinese state-run Global Times later declared that the US dropped bombs in Laos, while China builds railways. Covid restrictions were still in place in Beijing at the time of the opening, forcing Xi to officiate remotely. With the railway, the mountain from Kunming to Vientiane is no longer high and the road is no longer long, Xi said in a speech telecast by video link to a room full of Lao officials. A beaming Lao President Thongloun Sisoulith responded that his country had finally realized its dream of building a rail connection to its powerful neighbor and beyond. Two-way cross-border passenger services between Laos and China started in April. On a recent morning outside the Vientiane station -- a structure more imposing than the capital's airport -- visibly excited passengers extended their selfie sticks for photos. Still, it is not passenger travel that will reap benefits for Laos, analysts say, but freight -- and so far that has largely traveled in one direction, with goods exported from China coming into Laos and then on to Thailand. Only a few companies in Laos have been using the link to export products to China, and they have been almost exclusively Chinese, business executives say. As an Australian company, we have not seen the benefits, said one executive in Laos, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Only companies connected to the Chinese and Lao investors in the project appear to be able to get access, and without those connections, it is almost impossible to utilize the rail, the executive added. The Laotian government said it expects the railway, a 70-30 joint venture between Chinese state-owned companies and a Laotian one, to be profitable by 2026. But the parent company, which has no revenue other than that generated by the railway, has to not only be profitable but also pay back the 3.54 billion loan it obtained from the state-run Export-Import Bank of China. If the railway revenues are insufficient ... it is ambiguous who would bail that company out, Parks said. It is a phantom menace for Laos: They do not know whether they are going to be responsible for a small part of this debt, a big part or none at all. The crowd on the train had thinned by the time it pulled into the last station on the Laos side of the border. The town of Boten in the early 2000s was transformed by a private Hong Kong-based company from a remote outpost on Laos's northern fringe to a casino boomtown. Tourists from China, and also from other parts of Laos and neighboring Thailand, flocked to its nightclubs and gambling dens. Boten was designated as a special economic zone with a major casino as its centerpiece business. Built largely for Chinese visitors, for whom gambling is illegal back home, the town soon devolved into lawlessness. The Chinese government, in response, cut off electricity and telecommunication services to the zone, which came from neighboring Yunnan. The casino was forced to shut. Decay set in. Paint began peeling off the pink and yellow buildings. The Belt and Road Initiative offered Boten a new lease on life as the first stop in Beijing's plans to economically and physically integrate its neighbors. The special economic zone was rebranded from Boten Golden City, its moniker as a gambling destination, to Boten Beautiful Land. Haicheng Holdings, a private Yunnan-based developer, started to build residential buildings and schools in the town, hoping for a rush of Chinese migrants following the expected boom. Advertisements in Haicheng's showroom feature multiple photos of Xi with Lao officials calling Boten a pilot zone for deepening regional cooperation. Outside the marbled showroom, the reality of Boten bears little resemblance to Haicheng's gilded model city, and the marketing has done little to she would its unsavory past. The zone is devoid of the kind of suited businesspeople and bustling factories it claims to attract, or even tourists. Instead, Boten's few thousand residents are overwhelmingly Chinese workers building new residential towers and those working in services catering to them -- Chinese restaurants, Chinese shops and brothels. Private security guards with Chinese flags on their flak jackets police the area. Virtually no shops are run or owned by Lao. Businesses almost exclusively accept Chinese yuan rather than local currency. Steaming hot pot, barbecued meats and noodles in lava-red soup are featured here over Lao dishes like sticky rice and laab. By night, young women sit outside brothels bathed in purple and pink neon lights, while their handlers try to cajole Chinese men walking outside to come in. Phet, 32, is one of the few remaining Lao shopkeepers in the zone, running a small convenience store that sells snacks and Lao food made in a tiny back kitchen. He said he saw an initial rush of people when the train first opened, but business has since died down. The train has allowed Chinese visitors to bypass Boten, going directly on to Vientiane or Luang Prabang and returning to China without again getting off. Most difficult of all: Phet's landlord accepts rent only in Chinese yuan; with the devalued Lao kip, the cost of running his business has skyrocketed. Chinese bosses are so much stricter than Lao bosses, he said. We have no ability to negotiate with them. We cannot talk to them. Soutchai Phouthivong, 60, has driven a songthaew -- a pickup truck that functions as a shared taxi -- since the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge opened in 1994, ferrying people from the immigration checkpoint near Vientiane to Thai malls and restaurants in Nong Khai. Lao, particularly lower-income families who do not have cars, are his main customers. His income, he said, has fallen by more than half this year. Look, it is now almost noon and there are no Lao people around, Phouthivong said on a recent Wednesday. I am lucky to do one or two trips a day. What was once a routine trip for many Lao -- to seek medical treatment, buy goods that they cannot find at home or simply enjoy a weekend outing -- has become unaffordable because of the falling Lao currency and inflation. In Vientiane, prices are soaring for basics. A 52-year-old seller of dry goods said the noodles have tripled in price, turning from a staple to a luxury. Sonesavanh, a 46-year-old whose husband has depression, has turned to Buddhist healing, seeking blessings from monks and trying to improve their luck by rearranging furniture, because the medical treatment he needs in Thailand is now unaffordable. It is like a race between the economy and my husband, to see which one will get better first, she said. Discontent with both China and the Laotian government have melded together at this point, said Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations who wrote in April about popular unrest in Laos. It has turned into a generalized anger at China overall. You do not see that anger at other partners critical to Laos, like Thailand and Vietnam. In March 2022, Anousa Luangsuphom, 25 -- an activist widely known as Jack in Laos -- launched a Facebook page called The Power of the Keyboard, using satire and memes to criticize both his government and China's reach into his country. He also called for the end of one-party rule in Laos. On April 29, Jack changed his Facebook profile picture to one bearing the motto Fighting for Laos' survival, so we do not become China's slave. He then went about his day -- serving khao piak sen, a Lao noodle soup dish, at the shop he worked in, before meeting friends at a coffee shop and bar. That evening, a man entered the bar and asked in a few words of Lao if Jack was around. He briefly exited before returning and shooting Jack in the face and chest. I did not know what had happened to me, Jack said in an interview, his first since the attack. I just heard people calling my name. Jack was initially treated in a Laotian government hospital, before the Manushya Foundation, a human rights group, organized his medical evacuation. Doctors outside of Laos worked to reconstruct his jaw, but they predicted he would not regain speech for a year because of the extensive damage. Now in a safe location, Jack is relearning basic functions. He has difficulty chewing, and while he can speak, he struggles to articulate his words. He habitually touches the circle-shaped scar to the right of his lips, where the bullet entered his cheek. Jack does not know who shot him; he also has not been able to look at the video of his shooting, which was widely shared on Lao social media. All he does know is that the day he was shot, he had explicitly posted about what he called China's monopoly over Laos, which he described in an interview as tantamount to an invasion. Jack is trying to rebuild his life, helping activists get better at social media while waiting for more surgeries to fix his jaw and fully restore his speech. But Jack has stopped saying anything negative online about the Chinese government, or Chinese-linked projects in Laos. In the months following his shooting, two Chinese dissidents -- free-speech activist Yang Zewei, also known as Qiao Xinxin, and prominent human rights lawyer Lu Siwei -- were taken into custody in Laos. Yang resurfaced more than two months later in a Chinese detention center and has been charged with subversion of state power. Lu was deported to China in mid-September, despite pressure from Western governments and the United Nations to release him and allow him to travel to the United States, where his wife and daughter resettled last year. Lu had a YOU.S. visa. In a statement on October 11, the State Department condemned Lu's forced repatriation, which it said was at the request of Chinese authorities. Jack's fear now is that China's growing transnational policing will ensnare him, too. I did not realize that talking about China would get me shot, Jack said. I did not realize that talking about China is more dangerous than talking about the Lao government.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

Thomas Willett travelled from the airport to Gran Canaria but claims his emails have been ignored and he still does not know if his car has survived the fire. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it received a report of a car fire on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park 2 at 8.47pm on Tuesday (October 10). Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said up to 1,500 vehicles were inside the car park at the time of the fire. Thomas Willett, 29, a content manager for a real estate firm, from Essex, had travelled to Gran Canaria with his partner, arriving on Tuesday evening. Having parked their car on the third floor of Terminal Car Park 2, he said he believes others are being taken care of instead of those looking to confirm the state of their vehicle.

I have since emailed them three times and contacted them on Twitter over the course of Wednesday and (Thursday) but have heard nothing. We do not know if our car has been damaged or not, or how we will be getting home from the airport. Their duty of care should be to those whose vehicles have been impacted, but they seem to be replying to everyone else with other queries instead. Mr Willett is due to return home on Sunday but said: Currently, we have no means of getting back home. Lucy Lynam, a 42-year-old accountant from Hertfordshire, said she is none the wiser about the state of her car and is expecting the worst. Ms Lynam parked her car on Tuesday morning, as she had to attend a conference in Majorca, and first heard about the fire on Tuesday evening. However, she praised Luton Airport's communication, adding she had been emailed a couple of times with updates. She said: I am parked on level 2 against the perimeter fence (facing row C), nearest the apron, which, from the videos, seems where the bulk of the damage has happened. However, I am still none the wiser as to the state of my car. I would appreciate more information as to where the fire started based on a map view, maybe with a plan of row letters etc so I can estimate the likelihood of the level of damage to my car. I am expecting the worst. She said she regularly uses her car to transport her two children, but added that Luton Airport has been good at communicating with her about updates. I can only imagine they are operating in crisis mode behind the scenes, she said. They have emailed me a couple of times with updates and whilst there is little specific info around my individual vehicle, they have kept me up to date. Izabela, a 34-year-old beauty therapist in Willenhall, said she felt massive shock upon learning that Luton car park was on fire as she believes her car has been burnt. Izabela had boarded the plane to return from a holiday in Lanzarote with her husband Dawid when the pilot announced that there was an incident at Luton Airport and the flight had been cancelled. Izabela, who did not wish to share her surname, said we do not know nothing about our car, which contained a laptop, house keys and other items. She said the situation was a nightmare and added: Without the car, what are we supposed to do now? A London Luton Airport spokesperson said: We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car parking customers, and we recognise many are anxious for answers. We are working hard to provide those answers as quickly as possible, though this will take some time. We would like to thank our customers for their continued patience and understanding.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

All 21 coaches of the North-East Express train, on its way to Assam state from New Delhi, derailed near Raghunathpur railroad station in Buxar district of Bihar state, Magistrate Anshul Agarwal said. Two of them overturned and rested on their sides. Local residents rushed to the scene and helped passengers exit the derailed coaches. Ambulances later arrived and hospitals were alerted to receive injured passengers, police officer Deepak Kumar said. D.K. Pathak, a railroad official who was on the train when it derailed, said most injuries occurred in one of the derailed coaches. The because of the derailment is being investigated. Early reports said 70 passengers were injured. Agarwal said 31 of the injured were hospitalized. Others were able to go home after medical attention. The rescue work was over by Thursday morning with all passengers accounted for, he added. Cranes and gas cutters were used to clear badly damaged railroad tracks. The train was coming at a normal speed but suddenly we heard a loud sound and saw a plume of smoke rising from the train. We rushed to see what happened. We saw that the train had derailed, the Press Trust of India cited Hari Pathak, a person living in the area, as saying. In June, India had one of the country's deadliest rail crashes involving two passenger trains that killed more than 280 people and injured 900 others. A malfunction with the signal system was found to have caused the accident. Most train accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment. In August 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst train accidents in the country. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people. More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains daily across India, traveling on 64,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of track.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Please try again later verifyErrors  The Department of Labor launched inquiries into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after reports of children's grueling working conditions at the companies' plants surfaced. There are currently US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division investigations open at Perdue and Tyson Foods. No additional details can be provided as the investigations are ongoing, a Labor Department spokesperson told CBS News. The federal probe into the poultry producers comes after a bombshell report published in New York Times Magazine that zeroed in on the disturbing details of a 14-year-old boy who came from Guatemala to Virginia in order to support his family by working the overnight shifts at a Perdue plant. His arm was nearly torn off while working at a slaughterhouse, the article reported. The article also documented other cases of children conducting similar work at the Perdue plant, as well as at a nearby Tyson plant. These two companies produce one in three pounds of poultry consumed in the US, the article stated. Federal law restricts individuals under age 16 from working certain hours, and prohibits minors from working in meat processing plants due to the hazardous conditions. The Independent has reached out to the Department of Labor, Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms. A spokesperson for Perdue told CBS News that the company was appalled by the illegal child labour claims. We take the legal employment and safety of each individual working in our facilities very seriously and have strict, longstanding policies in place for Perdue associates to prevent minors from working hazardous jobs in violation of the law, the spokesperson said. We recognize the systemic nature of this issue and embrace any role we can play in a solution. Tyson, however, told the outlet that it had not been made aware of an investigation, so the company did not offer a comment. The NYT Magazine article reported that the poultry producers used contractors to hire cleaning staff -- a way to circumvent accountability for skirting child labour laws. One food sanitation contractor recently was forced to pay a 1.5 million penalty for employing over 100 children to work the overnight shifts at meat processing plants across the country, a Department of Labor investigation found in February. The chief legal officer for the Department of Labor, Seema Nanda, told the New York Times the Biden administration is now looking into whether the larger companies can be held responsible. We are long past the day when brands can say that they do not know that they have child labor in their supply chain, Ms Nanda said. The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

It reminds us that barbaric aggressors have no human compassion and are driven by an insatiable appetite for theft and atrocities. It is worth remembering that about a century ago, in the short span of five years, the Armenians experienced the beginning of the Genocide of 1915, the rebirth from the ashes at Sardarabad and the cruel division of our hope by the Turks and Soviet Russians. In 1988, the horrific earthquake occurred, followed by the brutal deportations of Armenians from Baku, only to be followed by the Artsakh liberation movement and the independence of Armenia -- all within three years. Sometimes we are forced to postpone the full cycle of mourning in order to take advantage of an opportunity or prevent further losses. It is surreal to internalize that we have just witnessed what was considered unthinkable in our conscious reality. Our position can and has changed quickly -- from humiliation to optimism and the inverse. It is never as hopeless as we may feel during difficult times and never as positive as we may believe during hopeful times. We must be ever cautious and self serving. Our experiences in Artsakh over the last 30 years teach us that painful lesson. Given the calamitous tragedies that have been our history, it is important to avoid wild swings in our emotions. This is where leadership earns its credibility, whether it is religious, political or social in nature. Leadership helps us avoid the peaks and valleys that can leave us damaged. The prevailing view in our communities is that the loss of Artsakh will not satisfy the genocidal motivations of criminal Azerbaijan. Armenians are living in fear today, as they have lost hope in their leaders and other nations. Is our sovereignty as a nation state the next chapter? Are we simply waiting for the enemy? The Azeris are coy but uncomplicated. They usually telegraph their next exploits. While the Europeans and United States issued statements of concern and diplomatic consequences, the Azeris ignored civility by amassing troops on the border before their assault on Artsakh last month. War games were organized with their complicit genocidal cousins prior to the 2020 war. With the blood still fresh from occupied Artsakh and the deported residents seeking a new life, Aliyev, emboldened by a lack of military and diplomatic resistance, now speaks of demanding eight enclaves, while he audaciously occupies 145 km of sovereign Armenian territory, holds POWs from 2020 and arrests the leaders of Artsakh. When there is little substantive opposition from foreign powers, he is free to demand almost anything. Even though Azerbaijan has committed genocide and numerous other criminal acts, the Europeans have not sanctioned Azerbaijan, because Azeri energy is more important than their often-stated principles of human rights, freedom and the rule of law. The United States has not even been able to end the waiver of section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Regardless of the quantity of weapons shipped, it is a clear statement of values when they pander to a terrorist state. The relationship with Israel is also a major variable. The current war with the Palestinians has heightened the wall between Iran and the West, particularly the United States. Despite the despicable Azeri-Israeli arrangement of energy and spy presence in return for billions in military hardware used to kill Armenians, the YOU.S. is not expected to sanction Azerbaijan. The YOU.S. may be motivated to outflank the Russians in the Caucasus, but apparently not at the expense of rogue Azerbaijan. In addition, Aliyev continues to rant about the Zangezur Corridor. Imagine the arrogance of two nations, Azerbaijan and Turkey, demanding a sovereign corridor to connect their stolen land that would unite the Turkish criminals and would severely wound Armenia. Despite the outrageous nature of their demand, it is considered one of the prime motivators for conflict in the Syunik region. Recently, there have been sources, one Iranian and the other Azeri, suggesting that Azerbaijan is considering a Plan B to Zangezur due to Armenian opposition. The Pashinyan government has consistently stated that there was never such an agreement in the trilateral statement of November 2020 and that Armenia would never accept such a concept. For its part, Russia has also stated that such an agreement does not exist. Given Russia's duplicitous politics towards Armenia, this should not be considered a reliable commitment for Armenia. The Plan B is a rail and land link on the Iranian side of the Armenian border. This plan is not a sovereign Azeri corridor and would be subject to the normal border and customs controls of the host nation. Iran seems to be offering this as an alternative to protect their interests in any territorial changes. Some sources believe Azerbaijan may find favor with this. Do not believe a word of this. Azerbaijan wants the Zangezur corridor for two reasons: to establish a land route to connect Turkey, Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan and to destroy Armenian sovereignty. Plan B does not address the latter. They also want at least the eastern shore of Lake Sevan. In this sea of chaos, two conclusions can be drawn: Azerbaijan will attack, and Armenia should not expect much military support from the western defenders of democracy. In light of the ominous clouds coming from the east, what should Armenia do to thwart such a challenge? As a baseline position, Armenia should continue bilateral talks with both Turkey on normalization and with Azerbaijan on a peace agenda. Let us not fool ourselves. The Turks and Azeris are looking for capitulation and destruction of our sovereign state, but negotiating can serve as a small deterrent with Russian, YOU.S. and European sponsorship. The best case scenario is that Azerbaijan will continue to be uncooperative, which could strengthen the Armenian position. The European organizers must have been annoyed with the Aliyev boycott of the recent Granada sideline discussion. Armenia's presence prevented a total embarrassment, but certainly not enough to overcome Europe's energy obsession. Talk of sanctions by members of the European Parliament should not raise optimism on the Armenian side. The Americans have had similar rumbling, but Congress is not in a position to pass binding legislation, and the State Department will only serve as a mediator. After publicly criticizing Armenia, the Russians have signaled that they may be willing to sponsor another round of trilateral talks. Of course, this type of gamesmanship should be expected, as the Russians will alternate short-term tactical positions to serve the longer term interest of controlling their backyard. The high volume of diplomatic engagement by the Armenian government may yet yield a defensive option. Whether motivated by self interest or a latent guilt complex, the West has offered several options to Armenia with onsite presence. The Artsakh disaster has Armenia flooded with European observers (increased and renewed), USAID personnel, a variety of diplomatic missions and other Western interests. Argentina has also offered onsite white helmet support to promote humanitarian needs and support. The military defense mechanisms to defend the homeland have been slow in developing. France has strongly hinted at providing military aid after a visit by a top official, but the content and timing is unclear. Deals have been announced with India, but again with uncertain timing. In an absurd irony, Russia maintains a military presence in Armenia, yet it has denied CSTO support several times in violation of the defense pact and has criticized Armenia's Western engagement. Russia clearly cannot be trusted to support Armenia, but it is still dangerous as the only regional power that can greenlight the Azeris. The YOU.N. Mission to Artsakh was a farce and insulting, as it was limited to an Azeri-controlled tour and foolishly declared no evidence of civilian targeting. This is comparable to allowing the criminal to guide investigators through the crime scene. It is another example of how the YOU.N., in the interest of remaining a global facade, has rendered itself ineffective. Perhaps the best option for Armenia is to invite as many foreign missions on the ground, particularly on the eastern front, as possible. The European and American presence could serve as a deterrent to Azeri military action. I do not think the Europeans and Americans will be as forgiving to the Azeris as the Russians were when their peacekeepers were murdered by the Azeris. Fortifying the defenses militarily goes without saying, but a physical presence of humanitarian, military attachs and consulate presence in Syunik might slow the Azeris down long enough to build a stronger defense. This is not a time to say no to any legitimate foreign presence that can further the short-term humanitarian and intermediate-term security issues in the homeland. On the contrary, we should be recruiting physical presence.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article

The train was coming at a normal speed but suddenly we heard a loud sound and a plume of smoke rose out of the train. We rushed to see what happened. We saw that the train had derailed and the AC coaches were the most damaged, Hari Pathak, a local resident said. Television visuals showed locals rushing to the rescue of the passengers and helping them come out of at least two toppled coaches. The visuals also showed a woman passenger in a state of shock being helped out of a coach by locals. Jagdishpur SDPO Rajiv Chandra Singh said electric wires and poles, and rail tracks have been damaged due to the accident. He said that while some coaches lost balance and fell, none of them overturned due to which there are less casualties. Chief Public Relations Officer of East Central Railway zone Birendra Kumar told PTI that the accident took place less than half an hour after the train left the Buxar station and was headed for Ara. The derailment took place near Raghunathpur station where the train does not have a scheduled stoppage, he said. Relief measures were initiated immediately after the incident, with ambulances and doctors rushing to the site. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav issued a statement stating that the departments of disaster management and health have been asked to take immediate steps to ensure the quickest possible relief to as many people as possible. I have also spoken to the district magistrates of Buxar and Bhojpur (where Ara is headquartered) with instructions to reach the site at the earliest and speed up relief work, he said. As a fallout, Indian Railways has cancelled ten trains and diverted 21 trains. Below are the details: According to a statement issued by the East Central Railway zone, trains that have been cancelled include: Patna-Puri Special (03230), Sasaram-Ara Special (03620), Bhabua Road Express Special (03617), Patna--DDU Memu Pass Spl (03203), Patna-Buxar Memu Pass Special (03375). Besides, two trains have been partially cancelled and they include: Patna-DDU Express (13209) which will run upto Ara and DDU-Patna Express (13210), which will also run upto Ara. Trains that have been diverted onto alternate routes include: Raxaul Antyodaya Express (15548), Dibrugarh Express (15945), Magadh Express (20802), Barauni Express (19483), Asansol SF Express (12362), Guwahati Poorvottar Sampark Kranti Express (22450), Brahmaputra Mail (15657) among others.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

It should get out of its track record of fixing responsibility at the lowest possible level of officials The ubiquitous railway accident has happened once again. This time, it has happened in Bihar, my native state and the Danapur Division of Indian Railways (IR) notorious for the worst type of chalta hai attitude when it comes to the maintenance of railway assets. What I say, I say with the utmost responsibility and firm conviction, because I belong to the place where the accident happened and have dirtied my hands working in the Danapur Division of East Central Railway for more than two years. I have personally handled the aftermath of Indian Railways' worst fire accident in Patna on May 16, 1990, in which 74 were roasted alive and 400 sustained severe burn injuries. It is reported that the accident happened at 9.40 pm, near the nondescript mufassil town Raghunathpur of the ancient Buxar district in Bihar. It transpires that 23 coaches of Assam-bound Delhi-Kamakhya North East Express derailed, with four coaches mangled, leaving at least four passengers travelling in AC coach dead and 50-100 injured, out of which more than a dozen seriously so. The travesty of India has been that the dataset of the actual number of injured in a railway accident has always been inexact, though in this case, it is not likely to be much different than reported. Having lost my younger sister on November 20, 2016, in the Indore-Patna Express accident, near Pukhrayan, Kanpur (at least 150 died and more than 150 injured), I dare say that money is no compensation for the loss of life. I have my own exacting standards and in the case of avoidable railway accidents, I consider IR senior management of the zone guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code and liable for imprisonment for life or imprisonment for up to 10 years and a fine. I am of the firm opinion that instead of fixing responsibility on the lowest ranked officials, let one DRM (if not GM) get exemplary punishment for an avoidable accident and such accidents will vanish altogether from the Indian Railways system. It is about time we stop playing the game of passing the buck. Nonetheless, for whatever is it worth, ex-gratia of Rs 10,00,000 has been announced to the next of kin and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Locals reached the accident site first, district officials next and the railways team last. True to his nature, the Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has walked the talk and reached the site within hours to inspect, monitor and expedite the rescue and restoration and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, an ex-Railway Minister himself, has assured full assistance of the state. So far so good. Soon, the debris of the derailed coaches will be removed, the track will be cleared and restored, and railways will chug along, till another accident happens. This has become the destiny of Indian Railways. It is reported that the driver of the North East Express anticipated some trouble applying the emergency brake when the train was travelling at a speed of 128 kmph and the severity of the accident can be ascertained by what impact it had on the guard of the train in the rear end. Here is what the guard of the Kamakhya-bound train, Vijay Kumar said: I was busy with my paperwork when I realised that the driver suddenly applied brakes. This was followed by a few jerks, and I fainted. Later, I found myself in the adjoining fields, where villagers were sprinkling drops of water on my face. (Source: PTI) Kumar was lucky to escape with minor injuries while passengers of the AC coach were not. It was a major accident with a relatively lesser casualty. The train was travelling at the maximum permissible speed, its 23 coaches derailed, four of its AC coaches (fortunately not ordinary second-class coaches) got mangled but only four died and barely a dozen got injured seriously. The low casualty could have been due to the safer anti-telescopic Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches which do not go turtle, luck by chance, sheer destiny or the divine intervention of Lord Rama whose karmabhoomi has been Buxar. Ashwini Vaishnaw posted on X (formerly known as Twitter), Will find the root because of derailment. I wish he does and does it soon and takes guilty to the gallows, figuratively, if not literally. The preliminary inquiry into the accident puts the needle of suspicion on possible issues with the track because the engine driver applied emergency brakes after sensing a rattling on the tracks. Though the real reason of the accident is yet to be ascertained, it is in the realm of the possibility that the alert driver with his foresight and quick reflexes might have avoided a more serious disaster. Nonetheless, as it happens with every consequential railway accident that involves the loss of a human life, a high-level enquiry by the Commissioner of Rail Safety (CRS) has been announced. CRS is expected to delineate the root because of the accident. And as is the usual fate of the CRS enquiry reports, the findings will be either accepted or not accepted by the Railway Board, but the CRS report will never be officially made available to public scrutiny, though convenient snippets will get leaked. In February 2012, the report of the High-Powered Safety Committee on Indian Railways, headed by the noted scientist Dr Anil Kakodkar, in its executive summary had the following to say: There is no practice of independent safety regulation by an independent agency separate from operations. The Railway Board has the unique distinction of being the rule maker, operator and regulator, all wrapped into one. Commissioners of Railway Safety though considered to be the safety watchdogs have negligible role at the operational level. Compliance of safety standards set by Railways for themselves are often flouted for operational exigencies. The Committee has recommended a statutory Railway Safety Authority (RSA) and a safety architecture which is powerful enough to have a safety oversight on the operational mode of Indian Railways without detaching safety with the railway operations. The Committee has also recommended measures to strengthen the present Railway Safety Commission to undertake meaningful regulatory inspections. More than a decade has gone by, but the above salutary recommendation of Dr Anil Kakodkar's Committee is yet to be implemented by the Railway Board, proving the ultimate observation of the committee's holy grain of truth -- Indian Railways suffers from the implementation bug. There is a history behind the above recommendation. E. Sreedharan, former managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and previous Member of the Engineering Railway Board was the official Advisor to the Kakodkar Committee, and yours truly, then Advisor of Strategic Planning to DMRC was the exclusive assistant and researcher on the matter to E. Sreedharan. The above recommendations were in reality written by me under the guidance of and with the approval of E. Sreedharan. I had two reasons to write what I wrote- One, the type of safety architecture in the form of an independent Rail Safety Authority was recommended after best practices research and the model recommended was in existence in the UK with the name 'Rail Safety and Standards Board' and was immensely successful. Two, as a resident of Bihar and IR insider having worked in railways in Bihar, I was privy to the deadliest railway accident in Bihar that happened on June 6, 1981, when a passenger train carrying more than 800 passengers between Mansi (Dhamara Pul) and Saharsa, derailed and plunged into the river Bagmati while it was crossing a bridge. The estimated death toll was between 500 to 800 though the railway stayed put with the official toll of 235 dead with 88 survivors. To date, one is not sure of the causes, though the widely talked about are cyclones or flash floods. The Commissioner Railway Safety report was never made public. Even today, a Google search Railway Board Makes Public the Report of Commissioner Rail Safety on Baghmati Rail Accident draws a blank result. During the last five years, consequential accidents in railways have gone down exemplifying a relatively better safety record. But thousands of innocent citizens and even railway employees, even now, die annually on railway tracks. It is time that I verbatim quote from the Kakodkar Committee because the situation has not substantially improved on the ground since 2012. One, casualties of Railways' own staff while on duty were collected from Zonal Railways and the position is markedly high. About 1600 railway staff were killed and 8700 injured while working during the period from 2007-08 to October 2011 which is substantially more than 1019 deaths and 2118 injuries in train accidents for the period from 2007-08 to 2010-11. Two, apart from the casualties due to consequential accidents, the Committee was informed that a large number of casualties take place over the entire railway system due to unlawful trespassing, though the exact figures have not been compiled by the Railways nor are readily available. The estimation is almost 15000 persons get killed on the entire railway system every year, of which, about 6000 deaths are only on the Mumbai Suburban System. The reluctance of Indian Railways to own these casualties, which do not fall under the purview of train accidents but are nevertheless accidents on account of trains, can by no means be ignored. No civilized society can accept such massacre on their railway system. (para 2.15.2 page 35 of the report). Any major accident with minor casualty like the one at Buxar or even a near miss without actual casualty, must be a wakeup call for the Railway Board bosses, who must get to the root because analysis, reaffirm zero tolerance for incidents, take exemplary action to punish those found guilty and ensure that the accident of the type is never repeated. And the Railway Board should get out of its track record of fixing responsibility always at the lowest possible level of officials. The Buxar accident is the first major accident in the tenure of Jaya Varma Sinha, the new Chairperson of the Railway Board. Instead of looking at Jaya as the first IR woman CEO, I have always admired her as one of the most competent, and urge her to take a vow to totally eliminate avoidable accidents from IR. It is possible. If India can land on the Moon with laser-focused attention to detail, it can also eliminate railway accidents. What is needed is the will and courage to take resolute, bold decisions and decisive actions and eliminate the curse thy name is avoidable railway accidents in India.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Police say it happened just after 11 p.m. as the two officers were coming into work at parking garage D at the airport. At the scene, the officers observed multiple suspects attempting to break in to nearby vehicles. When the officers intervened, the suspects opened fire, according to Interim Commissioner John Stanford. The first officer was hit multiple times in the upper body and the other was struck in the arm. The officer who was shot multiple times was transported to Penn Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. The second officer was originally taken to Methodist Hospital for treatment, but was later taken to Jefferson Hospital. The officer taken to Penn Presbyterian was later pronounced dead. Officials have not yet released the officer's identity but stated he was 50 years old with over 20 years on the force. He also leaves behind a spouse and child. The surviving officer is 60 years old and also has over 20 years on the force. One individual matching a suspect's description was transported to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during this time, according to Stanford. That person was pronounced dead at the hospital. It is unclear if that person is connected to the shooting. Stanford also said the suspect vehicle was described as a black Dodge Durango. This investigation is active and ongoing. No further information has been released. This is a numb, numb moment for us to again encounter something like this, said Stanford. We just had three officers shot last week. Two separate Philadelphia police officers were also involved in a car crash while responding to this shooting. It happened just before 12:30 a.m. Friday at the intersection of 48th Street and Baltimore Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia. Both are said to be in stable condition. No information has been released on what led to the collision. Terminal D was temporarily closed for the investigation but has since reopened.

On July 28, 2022, about 0814 local time, the passenger and car ferry Cathlamet had crossed Puget Sound and was approaching the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal in Fauntleroy, Washington, with 94 persons on board when the vessel struck a ferry terminal dolphin. One minor injury was reported. The damage to the vessel was estimated at 10 million, and the dolphin damage estimate was 300,000. Investigation NTSB determined that the probable because of the contact of the passenger vessel Cathlamet with the dolphin at the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal was the master's incapacitation, likely due to a microsleep, while the vessel was docking, and the quartermaster not actively monitoring the approach to the ferry terminal and intervening before the contact. Complacency The repetitive nature of ferry operations requires operators to sustain a high level of vigilance to prevent complacency. Complacency occurs when operators repeatedly complete a task without consequence, desensitizing them to its inherent risk. As with any repetitive task, individuals become increasingly familiar and comfortable over time with performing the task, which can lead to complacency. The bridge team on the Cathlamet exhibited complacency through their noncompliance with WSF policies when undocking and docking the ferry. The WSF policy required that the credentialed master or chief mate be present in the pilothouse when undocking the vessel. However, when the vessel departed Vashon Island, the uncredentialed quartermaster was at the helm, and the master was not in the no. 2 pilothouse, as he should have been. Additionally, WSF policy required that the master be at the helm and the quartermaster serve as a witness when the vessel is docking. As the Cathlamet approached the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal, the quartermaster did not actively monitor the master as the ferry approached the dock, as required by company policy, when he could have quickly taken the helm if the master became incapacitated. Adherence to procedures can help combat complacency. In this casualty, watchstanders did not adhere to procedures, which created a single point of failure. The requirement for a second person on the bridge provides redundancy in case a problem arises, such as the master becoming incapacitated. Following the casualty, WSF initiated a review and update of its bridge resource management policies and procedures; the review was still in progress at the time this report published",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

Cleaning contractors hired by US meat processors Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms have been accused of employing child labour. An article in The New York Times (NYT) suggested children as young as 13 were found to be working in the two companies' slaughterhouses located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. As a consequence of the publication's report, the US Labor Department has launched an investigation, which includes Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms, the NYT said. The probe also takes in the cleaning contractors Fayette Industrial, which serves Perdue Farms' slaughterhouses, and QSI in the case of Tyson Foods. QSI is part of the Vincit Group of companies. Just Food has approached the two meat processors for comment but has not received a reply at the time of writing. The NYT identified one child in the eighth grade, named as Marcos Cux, whose arm was mangled in a conveyor belt last year as he sanitised a deboning area in the Perdue plant. Other cases of child labour have also recently come to light. Another US meat processor, Monogram Foods, was fined more than 30,000 this year by the Labor Department for violating child labour laws at one of its plants in Minnesota. In April, the US subsidiary of Brazil-based meat major JBS ceased working with cleaning contractor Packers Sanitation Services (PSSI) after that business was fined 1.5m for using child labour. An investigation was also launched by the Labor Department into US snacks maker Hearthside Food Solutions amid suggestions of child labour. The company said in February it was appalled by the allegations, which also came to light through a NYT report. The publication's latest article on 23 September concerning Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms cited a response from the Labor Department's chief legal officer Seema Nanda. Nanda told the NYT in an interview the Biden administration is now looking into whether companies can be directly implicated when child labour is employed through contractors. We are long past the day when brands can say that they do not know that they have child labour in their supply chain, Nanda was quoted as saying. The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable. Spokespersons for Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms told the NYT that they would cooperate with any investigation, with both having policies prohibiting the use of child labour. The two companies were unaware that children were being employed at their Virginia plants, the newspaper reported. Tyson Foods informed the publication it was now hiring cleaners directly in 40 of its slaughterhouses, while Perdue Farms has taken up the services of an auditor for an assessment of the company's 'policies'.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

A person who was brought to a hospital privately and died there may have been involved in the shooting but investigators have not confirmed that, interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said at a late-night news conference. Stanford said the officers were arriving at work and were parked in the garage shortly after 11 p.m. when they saw several people breaking into a vehicle in the parking garage area. As the officers approached, the suspects opened fire, hitting one officer several times in the upper body and the other in the arm, Stanford said. One officer died shortly after 11:30 p.m. at a hospital. His name was not released but he was 50 years old and had 22 years with the force, Stanford said. The officer was married and had one child, Stanford said. They are here at the hospital, as you can imagine, heartbroken, Stanford said. The other officer was in stable condition. He is 60 years old and has 20 years with the police department, Stanford said. Both were assigned to the airport unit. Police said suspects in the shooting fled in a stolen Dodger Durango, which was being sought, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The same model of car dropped off an 18-year-old man, who had two gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead there, the paper said. That person was very similar to the suspect description but investigators had not confirmed his involvement, Stanford said. The shooting took place in the garage for the airport's Terminal D, which was temporarily closed during the initial investigation but later reopened. Stanford noted that the shooting came only a week after three officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call. A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this, he said. We just had three officers shot last week. And then this tonight, so you can imagine what we feel. We can imagine what this department is going through. And quite frankly, how the city should be feeling.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article

It highlights the vicious cycle between disasters and inequality - which WMO and partners are trying to repair through the Early Warnings for All initiative. Inequality and disaster vulnerability are two sides of the same coin: unequal access to services, such as finance and insurance, leaves the most at risk exposed to the danger of disasters; while disaster impacts exacerbate inequalities and push the most at risk further into poverty. 2023 has shattered temperature records, and seen record drought, fire and floods around the world. Poverty and inequality are exacerbating these disasters, says UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres in a message. Those with least are often at greatest risk from extreme weather. They may live in places that are more susceptible to flooding and drought; and they have fewer resources to deal with damage and to recover from it. They suffer disproportionately as a result, and may be pushed further into poverty, he says. The statistics speak for themselves. And these statistics have injected a sense of urgency into the international campaign, spearheaded by Mr Guterres, to ensure that life-saving early warnings reach everyone on the planet by the end of 2027. The Early Warnings for All initiative is being rolled out in an initial subset of 30 countries which are most vulnerable to extreme weather and climate change impacts. People living in these countries bear little blame for greenhouse gas emissions, but are bearing a disproportionate burden from the resulting climate change, says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. Early warnings for all can help bridge the gap in equality by ensuring that vulnerable and marginalized populations receive timely information and assistance, reducing the disproportionate impact disasters often have on these communities. In the coming year we will ramp up our support to countries through our regional specialized centres and by meeting priority needs identified in countries through funding mechanisms such as the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems initiative, the Systematic Observations Financing Facility and through our collaboration with the Green Climate Fund and other partners, says Prof. Taalas. Inclusivity is an integral part of the Early Warnings for ALL, ensuring that the messages reach all segments of the population, regardless of socioeconomic status, language, or physical abilities. This ensures that vulnerable groups, such as low-income communities, people with disabilities, are not left behind in receiving critical information. Addressing the intertwining challenges of disaster impact and societal inequality necessitates: International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction takes place every year on 13 October. It is spearheaded by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. UNDRR released a new Global Survey on Persons with Disabilities and Disasters. It showed there had been no progress in helping people cope since the last survey one decade ago. This is damning evidence of an unacceptable lack of progress which is leaving people behind. Persons with disabilities must be protected from disasters and this is ever more urgent with the increase in catastrophic climate-related disasters around the world, said Ms. Mami Mizutori, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Head of UNDRR. UNDRR and WMO are leading the Early Warnings for All initiative, along with the International Telecommunications Union and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and a growing number of partners.
