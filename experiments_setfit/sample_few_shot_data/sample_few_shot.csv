Air Quality Index or AQI measures the concentration of PM 2.5 levels Mumbai: A thick blanket of mist enveloped Mumbai on Thursday, with its Air Quality Index worse than Delhi's. As per Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI level was recorded at 166 in Mumbai on Thursday morning, while it was 117 in Delhi. Air Quality Index or AQI measures the concentration of PM 2.5 levels - fine particles of less than 2.5 microns that can enter the bloodstream and penetrate the lungs and heart - which are linked to chronic respiratory diseases. There are six AQI categories, namely Good Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. According to the AQI scale, the air quality check between 0 and 50 are considered good, 51 and 100 are satisfactory, 101 and 200 are moderate, 201 and 300 are poor, 301 and 400 are very poor, and 401 and 450 are severe and severe  when AQI exceeds 450. With the construction going on everywhere and the scorching heat ranging from 34 to 36 degrees, the Air Quality Index in the financial capital has been seen in the 'moderate' to 'poor category' for the last three days. During this period, the most affected areas have been Andheri, Mazgaon, Navi Mumbai where AQI remained beyond 300. At 6 pm on Wednesday, the PM10 level in Mumbai's air was 143, while that of Delhi was 122. Airborne particulate matter (PM) is not a single pollutant, but rather is a mixture of many chemical species. Those with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects. Mumbai's AQI was 113 on Tuesday, while Delhi's was 83. The situation was such that due to fog on Wednesday, local trains on the main line of Mumbai suburban network ran late by 15 to 20 minutes. The rains withdrew on October 10 itself, the land soil is completely dry, flying dust in the ongoing projects and increased traffic are all big factors. Earlier also in October the AQI was in poor category. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has formed a committee and they are looking for a solution, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director Sunil Kamble. Mumbai's guardian minister Deepak Kesarkar claimed that ongoing works of development projects such as metro were causing dust pollution in the city. The ongoing work of development projects like road and metro is causing pollution in the city. This is not chemical but dust pollution. We are looking for solutions... we will bring anti-smog guns like the one in Thane, so that the machines can suck the dust, they are working, said Mr Kesarkar. Bhagwan Keshabhat, founder of 'Paryavran', an organization working on environment, says that it is necessary that these projects - like road, metro, coastal - be monitored under one umbrella.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) claimed it was targeting Hamas terror structures including command centres and tunnel shafts used by the proscribed terror group. However, civilian casualties continue to mount, with a doctor in south Gaza saying at least 12 people were killed and 40 others wounded in an Israeli strike on a residential building in the city of Khan Younis. The latest round of bombings included targets in parts of the south where Palestinian civilians were told to take shelter, according to the Associated Press. This has heightened fears that nowhere is safe for more than two million Palestinians trapped inside the besieged territory. The IDF shared aerial footage showing buildings being razed to the ground as the Israeli military says it hit hundreds of Hamas infrastructure sites With people inside the Gaza Strip facing a humanitarian crisis amid a sustained blockade, Israel agreed on Wednesday to allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to Gaza. Many among Gaza's 2.2 million residents have cut down to one meal a day and have been left to drink dirty water after supplies of fuel, water, food and medicine were cut off by Israel. An agreement was reached between Egypt, Israel and the US on Wednesday to send 20 trucks of aid on Friday as medical supplies in the Gaza Strip reach breaking point. Doctors Without Borders has said hospitals are running out of electricity needed to run essential machinery, as well as medicine. The charity said surgeons at Al-Shifa hospital are now operating without painkillers, which is truly unimaginable. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation's team in Gaza said four out of 35 hospitals were not functioning due to severe damage or targeting, with doctors relying on their last reserve of supplies. It added: WHO has no supplies or equipment left in its Gaza warehouse. Health workers are having to make impossible choices to ration what little they have left in supplies, including operating without anaesthetics. Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas following the group's surprise attack on 7 October - sparking one of the region's bloodiest conflicts since the 1973 Yom Kippur war. The IDF shared aerial footage showing buildings being razed to the ground in the latest round of strikes by fighter jets, claiming to have killed a militant leader. It said it had hit anti-tank missile launching posts, terror tunnel shafts, intelligence infrastructure, and additional command centres. It added: During the fighting, numerous Hamas terror operatives belonging to the 'Nukbha' forces, who led the barbaric invasion of the communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, were targeted. More than ten terrorists were targeted in a precision aerial strike. IDF fighter jets, based on ISA intelligence, struck the head of the military branch of the 'Popular Resistance Committees' terror organization in Rafah, Rafat Harb Hussein Abu Hilal. The military added that dozens of mortar launchers were also struck, the majority of which were destroyed immediately after launching shells at Israel. Anger is continuing to mount over Tuesday evening's deadly explosion at Gaza's al-Ahli hospital, with Hamas blaming IDF airstrikes. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a proscribed terror group operating in Gaza, who dismissed the Israeli claim. With no sign of the conflict coming to a resolution, the death tolls continue to rise, with the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry saying on Wednesday that 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12,000 injured. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, and at least 199 others, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. Rishi Sunak has arrived in Tel Aviv for talks with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to minimise civilian casualties, as the IDF continues to bomb Gaza - one of the most densely populated areas in the world. During his meetings, the prime minister will share his condolences for those who have died in both Israel and Gaza. He will tell leaders that any civilian death is a tragedy and urge the international community to not allow the fighting to spill over into neighbouring countries.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israeli military says it has bombed hundreds of sites in Gaza over past 24 hours.

The ORR visited the station last month after analysing CCTV footage of three incidents of concern in the summer, which showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels and a lack of crowd control. There were reports of minor injuries and the potential for more serious consequences, the regulator said. The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services - such as those in the early morning and late afternoon - are more expensive and less used compared with off-peak services. This can result in overcrowding on off-peak trains at major stations. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said: Managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge, a challenge that our dedicated cross-industry team rise to each day, always putting passengers' wellbeing and safety at the forefront of their minds. Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. The ORR has asked us to look at some other specific areas and our team, along with our train operating colleagues, are already on the case making further improvements. Euston was the UK's fifth busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits. Last weekend, passengers travelling through Euston were faced with chaos after a points failure blocked all lines. The fault affected journeys in and out of the busy rail hub, with cancellations, delays and reports of passengers stuck on trains. One person described the 'utter chaos' of her journey travelling from Milton Keynes to Euston, took four hours instead of one.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"CCTV footage showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels.

Retail-investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown has also slumped after new client growth slowed during the first quarter. French carmaker Renault has also plunged after currency depreciations in Turkey and Argentina weighed heavily on the pace of sales growth in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard has moved sharply higher after the spirits maker forecast higher sales in fiscal year 2023-24. McBride shares have also surged. The British household and personal products business said that the favorable trading environment and momentum of the second half of fiscal 2023 has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Merck KGaA has also jumped. The science and technology major said it expects to return to growth during fiscal 2024, and continued growth also beyond 2025. Biopharmaceutical firm Sartorius has also shown a strong move to the upside after unveiling financial results for the first nine months of the year. YOU.S. Economic Reports The Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing an unexpected decrease in initial jobless claims in the YOU.S. in the week ended October 14th. The report said initial jobless claims fell to 198,000, a decrease of 13,000 from the previous week's revised level of 211,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to inch up to 212,000 from the 209,00 originally reported for the previous week. With the unexpected dip, jobless claims dropped to their lowest level since hitting 194,000 in the week ended January 21st. A separate report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed regional manufacturing activity contracted at a slower rate in the month of October. The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current general activity climbed to a negative 9.0 in October from a negative 13.5 in September, although a negative reading still indicates contraction. Economists had expected the index to increase to a negative 6.6. Looking ahead, the report said firms continue to expect growth overall over the next six months, but most future indicators declined.

And I will forever have those moments for the rest of my life. Concern about the health risks associated with chemical hair straighteners has grown over the last year since the National Institutes of Health released a study that found that women who used them frequently were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer as those who did not. Chemicals in the hair products, like parabens and phthalates, disrupt the hormone-regulating endocrine system, researchers said. A similar study released this month by researchers at Boston University found that postmenopausal Black women who reported long-term use of chemical hair relaxers were at increased risk of uterine cancer. The studies, however, do not go so far as to say the products because cancer. Most treatments for womb cancer result in infertility, and Black women are more likely to undergo hysterectomies. L'Oral did not reply to repeated requests for comment. Last year, it said the lawsuits had no legal merit. A spokesperson for Revlon declined to comment. Both companies have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits. What I think we are dealing with here is a product that is a conduit for severe reproductive harm that manifests itself in a number of different ways, said Danielle Ward Mason, an attorney who is representing thousands of Black women in cases against the beauty companies. But it is all equally tragic. And it is all emotionally taxing and devastating. And it is all physically debilitating. More than 90 of her clients have had hysterectomies, while the rest have had one or more myomectomy procedures to remove uterine tumors or fibroids, said Mason, a managing partner at Bullock Ward Mason. The increased attention on the possible dangers of hair-straightening products is little salve for women like Bree-Shawna Watts, 32, who had a hysterectomy last year after she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. Watts underwent surgery in April 2022 to remove what her doctors believed was a fibroid in her uterus that was causing her to have very heavy periods and serious pelvic pain. Her doctor, she said, hoped to save her uterus during the procedure so she would still be able to have children. But she recalled waking up after her surgery and asking a nurse whether everything had gone as planned. And she just looked down, and she looked so sad, Watts said, her voice breaking as she cried. The way she looked at me was like, 'You have no idea what is about to happen.' The nurse told her that her uterus could not be saved. The most crushing news came later, when she learned from her doctor that she had uterine sarcoma, a type of cancer. And she said, 'Because it had spread, I had to take everything except the ovary and the fallopian tube,' Watts said. So she took my uterus, my ovary, my fallopian, my perimetrium. Her doctor assured her that they would fight the cancer that had also been found in the wall of her abdomen and suggested she quickly retrieve eggs before her remaining ovary was removed. Watts said she opted not to harvest her eggs because it required her to inject the hormone estrogen into her body and she did not want to risk worsening her diagnosis -- a decision she now regrets. She underwent 25 rounds of radiation and also started hormone therapy, which she said she will have to continue for 10 years. After her operations and 25 rounds of radiation, Watts said, she plummeted straight into menopause at 31, an ordeal she described as hellish. I thought I was so strong, she said, but ... actually, nothing can prepare you for this.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The National Institutes of Health released a study that found that women who used them frequently were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer.

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. The house on Villegas Street, in the heart of Old Havana, looks nothing like the stately two-story home it used to be a century ago, with its high ceilings, wrought iron railings, semicircular arches and stairs covered in white marble. Its former elegance is such that local lore says it used to belong to a marquise. Today, everything inside the six-family unit is chaos. The roots of a tree protrude through the wall of a makeshift toilet where birds have made their nests. The roofs of the first and second floors are propped up. There is rubble and fresh sand scattered everywhere. The walls seem to tilt and the faade has completely disappeared, exposing a patio where one can see freshly washed clothes hanging. The structure is one of many once luxurious houses in the island nation that in recent years have partially collapsed -- or suffer visible damage. Barely 100 yards away, also on Villegas Street, a similar building fell in earlier this month, causing three deaths. CUBA ARRESTS 17 ACCUSED OF RECRUITING PRO-RUSSIA FORCES FOR UKRAINE WAR Residents say they have repeatedly asked authorities for help to no avail. Years of neglect, inclement weather and a deepening economic crisis only aggravate the fear that their home will eventually collapse. How can we not live in fear? Every time it rains I feel like small pebbles come falling down on me, said Maricelys Cols, a retired 64-year-old who has lived in the house with her 85-year-old mother for 59 years. And a collapse does not warn you. The Cuban government has in the past acknowledged the problem of housing deterioration, but says the lack of material resources prevents it from tackling it. Yet, many Cubans wonder why the pace of investment in tourism megaprojects such as hotels -- a vital business sector that has failed to take off in at least the last two years -- is not slowing down to address the dire housing crisis. The house on Villegas Street was built at the end of the 18th century or the beginning of the 19th on a plot measuring about 50 feet wide by about 200 feet deep. Three families live on the ground floor, where there used to be a main patio and rooms for the domestic staff. Three other families live on the more deteriorated top floor, where cracks abound and the staircase creaks as you climb it. All of the residents say the building once belonged to the Marquise of Pinar del Ro, a title granted by the Spanish crown when the island was part of its domains. The Associated Press could not verify that, but its elegant design is visible. Nowadays, everything smells of mold. AP interviewed all the residents in the unit, except for an elderly man who was temporarily staying in a relative's house. They unanimously reported having made efforts before the government, requesting to live elsewhere or to have access to materials for repairs. They said they never received a response. The Cuban government did not respond to an emailed request for comment. MOLOTOV COCKTAILS THROWN AT CUBAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON IN 'TERRORIST ATTACK,' MINISTER CLAIMS Mario Luis Poll, a 57-year-old art restorer who has lived in the building for 19 years, walks around his unit showing a reporter all the repairs he has done to try to hold the ceiling together after the floor of the room above collapsed. Right above him, 47-year-old musician Marcos Villa faces a different problem: Foliage from a tree is growing out of his improvised bathroom. The struts (the wooden posts that support the roof of the entire construction) are almost just for decoration, Poll said, shrugging in a sign of resignation. Cuba's housing crisis is one of the most pressing challenges facing the island, where a humid climate, the passage of hurricanes and other storms, poor maintenance and a low completion rate of new ones are usually among the top complaints of Cubans. Cuba's director of housing, Vivian Rodrguez, said earlier this month that the island has a housing deficit of 800,000 homes, especially in the provinces of Havana, Holgun, Santiago de Cuba and Camagey. CLICK HERE FOR MORE TRUE CRIME FROM FOX NEWS Government figures from 2020 say Cuba had 3.9 million homes, out of which nearly 40 were deemed to be in only fair or poor condition. The situation is critical, said Abel Tablada, professor at the Faculty of Architecture of the Technological University of Havana, adding that rebuilding and restoring partially collapsed buildings requires many resources that the Cuban state does not have in these moments of acute crisis. The residents of the house in Villegas Street, tired of asking authorities for help, can only sigh about the fate of the former mansion they inhabit. If those marquises came back to life and saw this house, they would surely die again, joked Elayne Clavel, 26, wife of musician Villa.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The house on Villegas Street, in the heart of Old Havana, looks nothing like the stately two-story home it used to be a century ago.

The United Arab Emirates, its Gulf near-neighbour, has viewed the fossil fuel as a way to build bridges with the Jewish state; Europeans see a way to replace lost Russian imports. This month's Hamas attacks on Israelis complicate both. Europe's gas problem this year is far milder than in 2022, when benchmark gas prices averaged 133 euros per megawatt hour. Despite a 25 jump since the October 7 attacks - also fuelled by labour disputes at Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and potential sabotage on Finnish pipelines - prices are still only about 50 euros per MWh. European gas storage is full, and consumption has stayed around 15 lower than before the crisis. Still, prior to the pandemic prices were only 18 euros per MWh. Before the Hamas attacks, Israel was seen as a tangible part of the mix for replacing the 155 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas exported to Europe from Russia in 2021, which represented a third of the bloc's consumption. Israel's ex-Prime Minister Yair Lapid last year reassured the EU that Israel would be able to deliver 10 of that in the near future. Analysts at Israel's Bank Leumi had estimated that exports would jump to at least 11 bcm this year. It is not there yet. Israel's 1,087 bcm of gas reserves in 2022 yielded 21 bcm of production, of which 9 bcm was exported, with a doubling of exports to Israel's main market, Egypt. That enabled the latter to re-export about 6 bcm of LNG to Europe. Brussels' support raises the prospect that Israel might be able to build its own LNG export infrastructure. Yet war could slow both that and the path to 15.5 bcm of annual European gas exports. The current situation also complicates an interesting piece of geopolitical MA. In March, the United Arab Emirates' state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) made a joint 2 billion bid with British major BP (BP.L) to purchase half of Israeli offshore natural gas producer NewMed Energy (NWMDp.TA). NewMed owns a 45 stake in Leviathan, the country's biggest gas field, and following Israel and the UAE's ground-breaking Abraham Accords in 2020 to normalise ties, the deal has wider significance. Since hostilities commenced NewMed shares have fallen about 20, even though Leviathan remains operational. But while BP has reaffirmed its interest, ADNOC's role may get more politically tricky if the conflict escalates. Because NewMed will still be 50 owned by Israeli group Delek (DLEKG.TA), a deal would see Arab money enable dividends for Israeli investors. That could be difficult as more civilians suffer via incidents like Tuesday's strike on Gaza's Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital, which Israelis and Palestinians blamed on each other. Short of more extensive shutdowns, Europe's generally healthy gas balance means it can probably weather the storm this winter. And the UAE's statement on the Hamas attacks was more measured than Gulf neighbours'. Still, Israel's gas sector has gone from a helping hand to a potential headache. Dutch TTF Natural Gas Futures, Europe's benchmark gas index, were trading at 48 euros per megawatt hour as of 0823 GMT on October 19. That is 25 above the level they traded at before Palestinian militant groups, mainly Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, launched a major attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, according to Intercontinental Exchange. Israel has suspended production at the Tamar gas field off its southern coast and will seek alternative fuel sources to meet its needs, the energy ministry said on October 9. Chevron, which operates the field, confirmed that it had been instructed by the ministry to shut down the field. Chevron said on October 10 that it had halted natural gas exports via the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline - the main link between Israel's Leviathan offshore gas field, which it operates, and Egypt - and that it was supplying gas via an alternative pipeline through Jordan. BP and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company's (ADNOC) 2 billion bid to acquire a 50 stake in Israeli gas producer NewMed Energy remains on track, BP's head of gas and low carbon energy Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath told investors at a BP strategy day in Denver on October 10, Reuters reported on October 11 citing sources present at the meeting.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israel's growing gas sector has a significance that extends east and west.

Incredible footage shows the 44mm-calibre weapon firing a number of rounds into the ocean from a ship as Japan accelerates its defences amid mounting tensions in the region. Weighing eight tonnes with a barrel length of six metres, the mega- weapon can reportedly fire at 6.5 times the speed of sound. Using electromagnets, the railgun unleashes 40mm steel projectiles weighing 320g at targets such as ships, missiles, and aircraft. Tokyo has been working on the weapon system for the last 10 years - and has made railguns one of the military's top priorities. Railguns could revolutionise the way wars are fought by having the potential to wipe out incoming hypersonic ballistic missiles. Sharing footage of the test, Japan's Ministry of Defence's Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency said the guns can be deployed early to protect ships against air-threats with high-speed bullets. The ministry told Naval News the offshore firing test took place from a Japanese Navy vessel - and claimed it was the first time any nation has test fired a railgun mounted on a ship. We were able to confirm compatibility with the vessel on which the railgun was installed and obtain data on the effects of ship-mounting on the railgun, it said. We believe that we achieved the desired results. Hoping to use the railgun on both land and sea, the successful test firing is a huge step forward. The Ministry of Defence intends to steadily work towards the early practical use of railguns in order to accelerate the strengthening of Japan's defence capabilities, it said. Although it is not yet known which ships Japan will mount railguns, it has previously been suggested they could be used on the Japanese Navy's destroyers. Japan started research on a small 16mm-calibre railgun in 1990 before deciding to develop the electromagnetic system to intercept hypersonic missiles. As well as the rail gun breakthrough, Japan plans to boost its stash of Tomahawk missiles and build its long-range missiles in the face of lingering threats from an increasingly aggressive China and North Korea. The railgun race is already on in the region as reports suggest China may have been testing the technology since 2018. Its ship-mounted railgun was reportedly mounted on a Type-072 landing ship. And it comes after China's military said it was testing what it dubbed the world's most powerful gun that can launch shells at 2,200mph. The futuristic weapon can reportedly fire a missile-size projectile within seconds as it paves a path for more accurate and catastrophic attacks. In its first firing test, the weapon accelerated a 237lbs projectile at a mind-blowing speed of 435mph in less than 0.05 seconds, according to those involved in the project. While the exact dimensions and maximum range of the weapon remain classified, a she will moving at this rapid speed could hit a target several kilometres away. The coil gun has advantages over traditional artillery - including higher launch speeds, lower launch costs, and shorter preparation time. Professor Guan Xiaocun with the Naval University of Engineering said: It has the potential for revolutionary breakthroughs in terms of speed, range, power, accuracy, safety, flexibility, and reliability. It is widely applicable in areas such as weapon systems, near-Earth satellites, and high-speed missile launches. The Chinese military has also heavily invested in a much larger 30-stage coil gun, which is still reportedly in its testing phase.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The 44mm-calibre weapon can reportedly fire at 6.5 times the speed of sound.

The discovery of a black market Chinese biolab operating in California, and the subsequent investigation into it, has exposed a tangled web of she will companies obscuring ownership and loopholes that caused delays in cleanup and informing the public. The public found out in March about a secret biolab operating in a warehouse in Reedley, California, about 25 miles southeast of Fresno. But the warehouse and its biological hazards were discovered months earlier, on December 19, 2022, by Jesalyn Harper, a code enforcement officer with the City of Reedley Fire Department. Responding to an anonymous tip about the supposedly vacant warehouse, Ms. Harper discovered thousands of vials of bacterial and viral agents, including coronavirus, chlamydia, E. coli, streptococcus pneumonia, HIV, hepatitis, herpes, rubella, and malaria. The business, operated by Prestige Biotech Inc., was also packaging and mailing out COVID-19 and pregnancy test kits, as well as housing nearly 1,000 lab mice. Ms. Harper reported her findings to the City of Reedley, which contacted the FBI on the same day. But there was no single authority that could deal with all of the pathogens, chemicals, and biological hazards. After Ms. Harper received the anonymous complaint about vehicles parked in the alcove, she went to investigate and also noticed a garden hose going into the building via a door being propped open -- a potential plumbing violation. Ms. Harper told The Epoch Times that she knocked at the door and saw three people boxing up pregnancy tests. One of them spoke no English, while the other two spoke very broken English. At the beginning, Ms. Harper said the trio were very cooperative, but as she walked to the southern part of the building they became deflective. As Ms. Harper asked more specific questions, she said the staff answered less and less, pushing for her to leave. Once she saw labels on the fridges such as blood, HIV, she realized it was a potentially hazardous environment and left the building. She reported her discovery to City of Reedley officials, who contacted the FBI immediately and met with them two days later, on December 21, 2022. The FBI took all of January 2023 to investigate and finally deemed the warehouse safe for city employees in early February. We had to look at these labs and break them down component by component and see who had the authority for each component, Ms. Harper told The Epoch Times. For example, the California Department of Public Health would have authority over medical devices like pregnancy tests; DTSC the Department of Toxic Substance Control would have oversight over some of the chemicals, possibly how they were being used. Experts in medical waste and environmental health were brought in to address the items in the refrigerators, medical waste, human waste, blood, and used pregnancy tests. The EPA and FDA were also involved, and both agencies retained some of the documentation and paperwork found in the lab. Each item had to be dealt with separately -- each drawer, each box, each container, each refrigerator, and each pallet had to be looked at by various departments depending on what was found. Meanwhile, Ms. Harper had been feeding and watering the lab mice found onsite while she and other city officials were figuring out who had authority. They discovered on March 16 that no one in the YOU.S. government clearly has regulatory authority over lab mice, so Ms. Harper used the California Health and Safety Code that references animal cruelty to obtain a warrant. A veterinarian then recommended to have the mice humanely euthanized, which took place after obtaining the requisite permit on April 12. An emergency ordinance, No. 2023-008, passed at the Reedley City Council meeting on Sept. 12 temporarily placed a ban on the establishment of warehousing and laboratories with biosafety levels 2 through 4 within the city limits. The City of San Carlos in the Bay Area has a similar ban. I have had a lot of sleepless nights knowing there is no one out there looking for these labs. This could be happening all over the United States, Ms. Harper said. It is been an eye-opening experience, realizing the many cracks in our government for these types of organizations to fall through, and also realizing that the government is not our first line of defense. Ms. Harper said these types of under-the-radar entities can purchase a lot of chemicals and a lot of biologicals easily and no one is watching over them to make sure they know what they are doing. City of Reedley staff were told by Prestige Biotech president Yao Xiuqin that his company had taken over the warehouse -- including the biological materials, samples, and lab mice -- from Universal Meditech Inc. after the latter claimed bankruptcy, according to a court document filed on June 15. Prestige Biotech is the main creditor of Universal Meditech. Universal Meditech was established in Tulare, California, on November 25, 2015, naming Mr. Zhu as CEO. The company obtained a California business license on March 20, 2019. Shortly after the pandemic started in March 2020, Universal Meditech switched from a cattle reproduction-related business to producing pregnancy test kits and COVID-19 test kits. In August 2020, a fire broke out at the company's Fresno location and a subsequent environmental health inspector's visit found that Universal Meditech did not have a hazardous materials plan for storing ethanol in the warehouse. Another name connected to Universal Meditech and many other similar companies is Wang Zhaoyan, who is also known as Wang Yan. Ms. Wang is also a principal in another California-based company, Superior Meditech Investments LLC, and an officer or managing member for three other related companies based in Nevada -- PBI Diagnostic Laboratory LLC, Medi-Source LLC, and David Destiny Discovery LLC. All of the executives and all the companies eventually lead back to Mr. Zhu, the Chinese man with a Canadian passport. Mr. Zhu and several of his companies have been mired in legal battles stretching from Canada to Hong Kong to the United States since 2008. In September 2010, Mr. Zhu filed a proof of claim as the owner of Ai De Biopharmaceutical in a bankruptcy proceeding for yet another of his companies, JingJing Genetics Inc. Ai De Biopharmaceutical's street address in Qingdao is the same as other Chinese medical firms such as Qingdao Guangdi Packaging Material and Ai De Diagnostic. According to import records, most of these firms have shipped medical supplies to Universal Meditech and Prestige Biotech. In the late 1990s, Mr. Zhu flew a dozen Holstein cattle (a breed known for high milk production) from Quebec to Beijing to enhance milk production in China, where it was in great need. A decade later, Mr. Zhu's focus switched to breeding technologies. Rather than transporting cattle to China, IND Dairytech began sending Holstein semen and embryos in an effort to develop cattle herds. Primarily serving customers in Canada, IND Dairytech was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2008, delisted in 2011, and acquired shortly afterward by IND Lifetech, another company controlled by Mr. Zhu. Not long after IND Lifetech acquired IND Dairytech, it changed its name to JingJing Genetics, still based in Canada and controlled by Mr. Zhu. In 2008, JingJing Genetics was sued by XY LLC, a Colorado-based company that claimed damages for conspiracy, deceit, breach of confidence, breach of contract, and inducing breach of contract. The company was the master licensee in control of all sperm sorting in non-human mammals worldwide. JingJing Genetics was allegedly stealing XY's technology to manufacture and sell bovine sexed semen, but without the strict controls required from a licensee. The case was decided in 2012, with the judge ruling against JingJing Genetics for violating intellectual property agreements. Canadian Judge Stephen Kelleher also issued JingJing and its principals a permanent injunction from using the so-called cytometer technology that analyzes and sorts cells for choosing the sex of the offspring. Judge Kelleher subsequently found Mr. Zhu in contempt for nonpayment of the CA8.5 million and in 2015 sentenced him to jail for six months. But Mr. Zhu had fled Canada in 2014, and The Epoch Times was unable to find evidence that he has ever returned. While ruling in another British Columbia Supreme Court case involving Mr. Zhu and his many companies, Justice Shelley Fitzpatrick said, Zhu's counsel indicated to me that Zhu is afraid of setting foot in this jurisdiction for fear that he will be arrested, according to court documents. It is difficult to express the degree and scope of Zhu's wrongdoing in relation to his concerted plan and actions to steal XY's Confidential Information for his own financial ends, Judge Fitzpatrick wrote in her ruling. Court documents show transcripts from messenger app WeChat between Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu from 2014. The messages reveal that Mr. Zhu's goal was total bankruptcy for XY. If the new system is swiftly marketed, causing the overall sexed semen production cost to fall by twice as much, how do you think they are going to live from now on? ... So I propose using about 3 years in making XY collapse or be acquired cheaply, Mr. Zhu wrote in a text to Mr. Xu in May 2014. At the most opportune time, to acquire XY using the best price should be our basic strategy. Before that, we shall engage in attrition with them, drag them on as much as possible, drag them down, to let them feel all the time the sword of Damocles is on their heads. For this, we have already designed a comprehensive operational scheme. In an email to Mr. Tang and Mr. Zhu, Mr. Xu wrote, Well it seems American imperialism is very cunning, suggest to make an imitation one, clearly referring to XY. Mr. Zhu replied, The law is strong, but the outlaws are ten times stronger. In her ruling, Judge Fitzpatrick said: The evidence makes clear that all of these defendants each played a part in the overall plan to steal XY's confidential information for their own use by various means. GNT was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 2000 and then registered as a private company in Hong Kong in 2014, according to court documents. Peter Wang and another man were appointed as GNT's first directors and major shareholders, as they were also employed by companies within IND Group, the group of companies controlled by Mr. Zhu with operations in Canada and China. Peter Wang is Mr. Zhu's brother-in-law. Mr. Zhu and GNT appealed the case in Hong Kong on two grounds: one was jurisdiction-related, and the other was that Mr. Zhu did not own GNT. The onus was put on XY to litigate that Mr. Zhu controlled GNT, which caused lengthy delays in the case. During the trial, IND employees testified that they did not know who their actual employer was and that they were moved around between companies without knowledge or consent while keeping the same roles. They only knew they had been transferred when they received their paycheck from another company. They regarded all the various companies involved as one group -- the IND Group -- all owned and controlled by Mr. Zhu. Employee testimony revealed that Mr. Zhu instructed an accounting manager in the IND Group to transfer money out of IND LifeTech Group Ltd to GNT's account to avoid execution by XY. According to testimony from James Yunjian Yang -- a former IND office manager from 1999 to 2014 -- several offshoot companies operated in the United States. Mr. Yang was involved in developing businesses in California, Australia, and Uruguay. Specifically, in Uruguay, where Mr. Yang set up IND Lifetech Uruguay, Mr. Zhu asked him to be a director of this new company. Mr. Yang asked for a secondary position, as he did not want to take full responsibility, according to his testimony. As a result, a consultant, Edward Richard, agreed to be a shareholder. Mr. Yang, despite owning 95 percent of the company on paper, said he always considered Mr. Zhu the owner. The evidence reinforces a good arguable case that although Jesse Zhu has never been a director or shareholder of GNT, he controlled or owned GNT, the court document states. Although the various companies appear to have been set up for different purposes, they were, from Mr. Zhu's point of view, interchangeable as his wishes dictated. A search for Universal Meditech Inc. returned 132 legal cases in 10 countries -- 116 in the United States -- while Prestige Biotech returned 53 cases in four countries, of which 31 are in the United States. The Epoch Times contacted Prestige Biotech, Universal Meditech, Jesse Zhu, and Wang Zhaoyan for this article, but received no response. Ms. Harper, the City of Reedley code enforcer, said that after reports of the issues the city was having surfaced during the Reedley investigation, Fresno officials denied the proposal for the new location, and Universal's lease was canceled. It is deeply disturbing that a Chinese company set up a clandestine facility in small-town America that contained, per the CDC, 'at least 20 potentially infectious agents' like HIV and the deadliest known form of malaria, said Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), chair of the committee. Responding to the subpoena, Reedley officials turned over thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of photos, and hours of video. The FBI replied to an Epoch Times inquiry about the investigation, saying: The Reedley matter is being handled by local Fresno County officials. In keeping with long-standing policy, the FBI has neither confirmed nor denied any investigation and has not commented on this matter. Ms. Harper said she is had a lot of sleepless nights since discovering the secret biolab. I am sitting at home, and I am thinking, 'Gosh, you know, this is happening here in Reedley, this could be happening all across the United States,' she told The Epoch Times. It keeps you up at night, knowing that there is no one out there looking for these labs. And even if we do find them, a city or county could get frustrated to the point that they just tell them, 'OK, here is a notice, move out,' and then it just moves on to the next city.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Chinese companies have a troubling history in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, and a handful of other countries. The discovery of a black market Chinese biolab operating in California, and the subsequent investigation into it, has exposed a tangled web of she will companies obscuring ownership and loopholes that caused delays in cleanup and informing the public. The public found out in March about a secret biolabs operating in a warehouse in Reedley, California, about 25 miles southeast of Fresno. But the warehouse and its biological hazards were discovered months earlier, on December 19, 2022, by a code enforcement officer with the City of Reedley Fire Department."

The total fell to 18.509 million barrels as of October 16, after climbing 20 in the previous two weeks, the FOIZ data published October 18 showed. The total stockpile is now down 10 since the end of 2022. Middle distillates such as jet fuel and diesel led the decline, falling 35 in the week to 1.631 million barrels, the lowest in six weeks, the data showed. Light distillates slipped 6.1 to 5.467 million barrels, a two-week low, while heavy distillates used as fuel oil for power generation and shipping were little changed at 11.411 million barrels. Oil product exports excluding fuel oil from Fujairah averaged an estimated 4.8 million barrels in in the week that began October 9, the most in 10 weeks, according to SP Global Commodities at Sea data. Saudi Arabia was the destination for 278,000 barrels of jet fuelkerosene, the most since September 2019, and 255,500 barrels of gasoline and blendstock. Fuel oil exports averaged 455,300 barrels in the latest week, the lowest since the week that began May 29. Heavy distillates stockpiles are up 13 so far in 2023, while light distillates have dropped 27 and middle distillates have declined 47 over the same period. Demand fluctuates Despite lukewarm bunker demand for the low sulfur fuel oil grade, a healthier relative demand landscape for high sulfur fuel oil may have capped overall fuel oil stockpiles in Fujairah, local traders said. Specifically, heavy residue stocks recorded only a marginal 0.3 weekly decline, equivalent to 36,000 barrels, in the week ended October 16, FOIZ data showed. Volumes of HSFO inquiries have been fluctuating over the past few trading sessions, as some buyers deferred requirements amid stronger international crude oil prices, according to Fujairah-based bunker suppliers, while this has also limited LSFO refueling demand too. Stronger Brent crude prices will not be helping, the market has been sometimes quiet on inquiries. Barging slots remain available on very prompt basis by a couple of suppliers, a Fujairah-based trader said October 18.

The Seapeak Catalunya tanker has changed course from Egypt's Idku LNG plant and is now heading to the Algeria's Arzew LNG facility instead, LSEG analyst Olumide Ajayi said citing shipping data. Chevron (CVX.N) has shut down the Israeli Tamar gas field amid the military conflict in the country and suspended exports through the subsea EMG pipeline, which runs from Ashkelon in southern Israel to Egypt. Egypt relies on Israeli gas imports to meet some of its domestic demand and therefore the pipeline cuts mean there is less gas available for LNG exports, Ajayi said. This year to-date, 50 of Egyptian exports have been sold into the European Union and Britain, based on LSEG ship-tracking data, he added. However, the country has not exported any LNG since July amid high domestic demand this summer and was only set to resume exports in October. Egypt imports about 7 billion cubic feet per year of natural gas from the Israeli Tamar and Leviathan gas fields, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Egypt exported 3.7 million tonnes of LNG between October 2022 and January 2023, hitting a high of just below 1 million tonnes in December 2022, the firm said in a note. The ongoing conflict is likely to have a limited impact on prompt European gas prices given current mild weather, full storages and the potential for more YOU.S. LNG imports, Aditya Saraswat, head of Middle East upstream research at Rystad Energy said. However, there remains a risk of escalation into a broader conflict that could cause a short-term increase in energy prices, Saraswat said. The front-month Dutch TTF hub contract , the European benchmark, was trading 3.4 lower on Thursday at 47.80 euros per megawatt hour, but still some 25 higher than before the Israel-Hamas conflict.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Seapeak Catalunya tanker has changed course from Egypt's Idku LNG plant.

Alsu Kurmasheva, a dual Russian-American reporter with Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty (RFERL), was detained in the southwest Russian city of Kazan on Wednesday while awaiting the return of her passports, her employer said in a statement released on Thursday. RFERL said Kurmasheva, who is based in Prague, has been charged with failure to register as a foreign agent, a designation Russia requires of any organizations or individuals that it perceives as receiving foreign funding. It has been used to target journalists and people who speak out against the Kremlin. The charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, said RFERL, which is a YOU.S. government-funded media company. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was arrested on espionage charges in March and faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Kurmasheva has been working with the company's Tatar-Bashkir Service, RFERL said. She traveled to Russia for a family emergency in May, according to RFERL, and was temporarily detained while waiting for her return flight on June 2 at Kazan airport, where she had her YOU.S. and Russian passports confiscated and was not able to leave Russia since then. Kurmasheva was waiting for her passports to be returned when the new charge was announced on Wednesday, RFERL said. It has called for her immediate release. Russian news outlet Tatar-Inform said Russian authorities accused Kurmasheva of conducting a targeted collection of military information about Russian activities via the Internet in order to transmit information to foreign sources. NBC News could not verify this claim. There was no immediate reaction from the White House to Kurmasheva's detention. NBC News has reached out to Russia's foreign ministry and the YOU.S. embassy in Moscow for comment. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a separate statement it was deeply concerned about Kurmasheva's detention, calling charges against her spurious, and also called on Russian authorities to release her immediately. Her detention follows that of Gershkovich, who is still awaiting trial after having multiple appeals declined. Gershkovich and his employer deny all charges against him and is considered wrongfully detained by the YOU.S. government.

It has started testing Digit, a two-legged robot that can grasp and lift items, at facilities this week. The device is first being used to shift empty tote boxes. The company's ambitious drive to integrate robotics across its sprawling operation has sparked fears about the effect on its workforce of almost 1.5 million humans. Tye Brady, the chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, claimed that - although it will render some jobs redundant - the deployment of robots would create new ones. In a briefing at a media event at an Amazon facility on the outskirts of Seattle, Brady told reporters that he wants to eliminate all the menial, the mundane and the repetitive tasks inside Amazon's business. He denied this would lead to job cuts however, claiming that it does not mean Amazon will require fewer staff. Insisting that people are irreplaceable in the company's operation, Brady pushed back at the suggestion it could one day have a fully-automated warehouse. There is not any part of me that thinks that would ever be a reality, he said. People are so central to the fulfillment process; the ability to think at a higher level, the ability to diagnose problems. We will always need people ... I have never been around an automated system that works 100 of the time. I do not think you have as well. Digit was developed by Agility Robotics, a start-up based in Corvallis, Oregon, and backed by Amazon. The robot, which can walk forwards, backwards and sideways, and can crouch - is 5ft 9in (175cm) tall and weighs 143lbs (65kg). It can carry up to 35lbs (16kg). Amazon plans to put Digit to work in spaces and corners of warehouses in novel ways, it said in a blog post. We believe that there is a big opportunity to scale a mobile manipulator solution, such as Digit, which can work collaboratively with employees. Our initial use for this technology will be to help employees with tote recycling, a highly repetitive process of picking up and moving empty totes once inventory has been completely picked out of them. Ford, the carmaker, was the first buyer of Digit robots. Agility Robotics got investment from Amazon's Industrial Innovation Fund last year. Separately at Wednesday's event, Amazon announced it was deploying a robotic system called Sequoia at one of its Houston warehouses in a bid to speed up deliveries. The system is designed to help identify and store inventory 75 more quickly, it said, and reduce the processing time of orders by as much as 25. On stage, Brady said: Collaborative robotics involves people. How can we have people be the stars, the spotlight, the center of the show, when it comes to the jobs that we have to do? When we do our job really, really well, our robotic systems just kind of blend into the background to become ubiquitous. You do not talk about your dishwasher too much in your kitchen.

Report: Claire Robinson Scientists at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute -- the animal research centre where Dolly the sheep was created -- have used CRISPR gene editing to develop chickens that resist infection by bird flu, a disease that has decimated some wild bird populations and commercial poultry flocks across the world. But there are serious risks and limitations in the research, which were even indicated by the scientists involved but were largely ignored or downplayed by mainstream media outlets. A press statement by the Roslin called the gene-edited chickens a significant step in bird flu fight and said, Alterations to key gene associated with infection offer partial protection and suggest a path to flu-resistant poultry. The findings are published in Nature Communications. The Roslin reported that the scientists used gene-editing techniques to identify and change parts of chicken DNA that could limit the spread of avian flu in the birds. The bird flu virus needs a protein present in chicken cells, ANP32A, to replicate. Prof Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London, a co-author of the study, said, It occurred to us if you could disrupt that interaction and prevent the protein from being used, the virus would not be able to replicate. The team of scientists, led by Mike McGrew, a University of Edinburgh researcher, used the CRISPR gene editing technique to modify the gene that produces the protein in the chickens' germ cells, which would enable the birds to pass down the change to their offspring. As a result, the Roslin said, Researchers were able to restrict - but not completely block - the virus from infecting chickens by altering a small section of their DNA. The birds showed no signs that the change in their DNA had any impact on their health or wellbeing. When the gene-edited chickens were inoculated with 1,000 infectious units of the virus - equivalent to real-world exposure - only one in 10 birds were infected and she would a very low amount of virus over a few days. All the control birds were infected. When exposed to an extremely high dose of 1m infectious units, five of the 10 birds became infected, though with a viral load lower than seen in the control chickens. The Roslin said, The findings are an encouraging step forward, but experts highlight that further gene edits would be needed to produce a chicken population which cannot be infected by bird flu - one of the world's most costly animal diseases. No easy button for flu The research predictably generated a slew of pro-GMO hype. The Guardian patriotically headlined its article, World's first flu-resistant chickens could pave way for gene-edited UK poultry. But the New York Times (NYT) was more cautious, emphasising from the start the scientists' own warnings that the study also highlights the limitations and potential risks of the approach. The NYT cited the researchers' finding that some breakthrough infections still occurred, especially when gene-edited chickens were exposed to very high doses of the virus. And when the scientists edited just one chicken gene, the virus quickly adapted. The findings suggest that creating flu-resistant chickens will require editing multiple genes and that scientists will need to proceed carefully to avoid driving further evolution of the virus, the study's authors said. The NYT quoted Prof Barclay as saying that the research is proof of concept that we can move toward making chickens resistant to the virus, but we are not there yet. The NYT also quoted Dr Carol Cardona, an expert on bird flu and avian health at the University of Minnesota, as cautioning that the results show how difficult it will be to engineer a chicken that can stay a step ahead of the flu, a virus known for its ability to evolve swiftly. There is no such thing as an easy button for influenza, Dr Cardona said. It replicates quickly, and it adapts quickly. Step towards making bird flu more infectious to humans? In additional experiments, the researchers studied samples of the virus from the gene-edited birds that had been infected with bird flu. They found that these samples had several mutations, which appeared to allow the virus to use the edited ANP32A protein to replicate. Some of these mutations also helped the virus replicate better in human cells, although the researchers wrote that these mutations alone are not sufficient to adapt an avian influenza virus to humans. While the researchers appeared reassured by that, in GMWatch's view, they should not be. Triggering these mutations in the virus and facilitating its enhanced replication are important steps towards making bird flu more infectious to humans. There have already been cases, albeit rare, of humans catching bird flu and dying from it. Gene-edited chickens, if they were to be commercialised, could make it easier for bird flu to jump to human hosts and even spark another pandemic. Commenting on the new research, molecular geneticist Prof Michael Antoniou, who uses older-style GM and gene editing in a clinical research context, warned: The more you push viruses like flu to adapt, the greater the risk that variants will arise that can cross species, including ones that can now infect humans. This is not unprecedented. Multiple genes have to be engineered The researchers on the gene-edited chicken project also found that the mutated flu virus was also able to replicate even in the complete absence of the ANP32A protein by using two other proteins in the same family. When they created chicken cells lacking all three of these proteins, the virus was not able to replicate. Those chicken cells were also resistant to the highly lethal version of bird flu that has been spreading around the world in recent years. For this reason, the NYT reports, the researchers are now working (https:www.nytimes.com20231010sciencebird-flu-chickens-crispr.html) to create chickens with edits in all three of the genes for the protein family. For Prof Antoniou, this is where this venture breaks down. He said, This research is a very tenuous 'proof of concept'. The researchers realise that they have to 'knockout' multiple genes to get any reasonable outcome. But the more genes you knockout, the less viable the birds become because you disrupt basic biological functions that the animals need just to survive. As a result, in my view, the researchers will run up against a brick wall. Prof Antoniou is not alone in warning about this issue. The NYT quotes Dr Richard Webby, a bird flu expert at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who was not involved in the research, as questioning whether chickens with edits in all three genes would still develop normally and grow as fast as poultry producers needed. In GMWatch's view, the high adaptability of flu viruses, the risks of this research driving the selection of more human-infectious viruses, the potential to create chickens with health problems or abnormalities, and the overall complexity of life should spell the end of this research, the outcomes of which are all too predictable. But these realities are not going to stop these types of studies as long as the money train is still running. Alternatives to GM There are several alternative approaches to the bird flu problem that have been ignored or downplayed in the media circus around the gene-edited chicken research. Vaccines are sometimes mentioned. But attempts to develop effective vaccines for bird flu have proven elusive, because the proteins on the virus's surface that are recognised by the immune system mutate rapidly. One vaccine has been approved for use in chickens in the EU, but it is not widely available. However, it is clear that genetic engineering is not needed to combat bird flu. Earlier research carried out at the Pirbright Institute and the University of Lincoln in the UK found that some poultry lines are naturally genetically resistant to bird flu, without any genetic engineering being involved. Why this line of research is not being aggressively followed up is anyone's guess. Our guess would be that non-GM naturally flu-resistant poultry lines are not patentable. They are therefore of little interest to institutes that have jumped on the GMO bandwagon, except as a source of genes to mine for genetic engineering ventures. Natural immunity As well as the things that we could do but are not doing, there are things we are doing but should not. The process of developing natural immunity in our commercial poultry is also undermined by government official policies of killing entire flocks of birds where even one case of flu has been detected. This means killing the birds that will overcome the disease or not catch it in the first place, when it is those very birds that should be preserved to breed a national flock that is naturally resistant to the disease. Mass culls make about as much sense as a human flu control measure consisting of killing an entire community of people when one of them catches flu. It is a recipe for fostering a population with no immunity at all. In livestock farming, such an approach, if aggressively pursued for several generations, could even lead to the mass collapse of certain sectors of the food animal industry due to lack of resistance to disease. One potential example is the policy of removing from the herd and killing cattle that react positively to the TB antibody test, even when they are apparently super-healthy. More than one cattle farmer has told me that these cattle invariably proved clear of disease in the compulsory followup post-mortem, suggesting that they had been exposed to TB, developed antibodies (hence the positive test), then recovered. The farmers - under their breath and off-the-record - spoke words to the effect that Some of us know we are killing the wrong animals. These are often the healthiest animals in the herd. Intensive farming is the culprit The most useful and most-needed approach to bird flu would be to end factory farming of poultry. The gene-edited chicken research has justifiably prompted criticism of industrial poultry farming systems, which are incubators for disease. In response to the new study, regenerative farmer Ajay Vir Jakhar tweeted, This is what is wrong with the food systems; altering a chicken's DNA to tackle bird flu, which is a result of industrial scale poultry farming. Jakhar's view is backed by a report by Compassion in World Farming (CiWF), which pointed out that while wild birds have taken much of the blame for spreading bird flu among commercial poultry flocks, the development of highly pathogenic strains of bird flu lies at the door of factory farming. The report explained, Whilst not denying that wild birds, backyard and free range farms naturally play a role in the spread of bird flu, the overwhelming evidence points towards other often more important routes of spread - namely the global trade in live poultry and poultry products. CiWF cites research showing that The spread of the bird flu virus H5N1 from China to Europe, Africa and the Middle East correlates with major road and rail routes rather than bird migratory routes or seasons. CiWF concluded, Keeping massive numbers of poultry on intensive farms worldwide is now coming back to bite us. The solution lies in bringing an end to factory farming and the conditions that can act as a disease pressure cooker, instead rearing animals using humane and sustainable farming methods. There is a real risk that in the unlikely event that the GM gene-edited chicken approach were found to work, it would simply encourage and facilitate the type of intensive farming and inhumane conditions that led to the bird flu epidemic in the first place. CiWF's report was published in 2007. The Guardian published an excellent article about it, emphasising the report's demand for a radical restructuring of the industry to raise healthier birds in better environments. Yet it seems that the more influential sectors of society have learned little about disease prevention, instead choosing to hype risky and unproven GM approaches that threaten to perpetuate animal suffering and even to spark another human pandemic.

The Disneyland Paris stopover was, unfortunately, too short for the MEPs. A special chartered train carrying members of the European Parliament and their teams to Strasbourg made an unplanned visit to Disneyland Paris due to a signaling error. According to The BBC, hundreds of members and staff of the European Parliament were sitting on the train that started in Brussels and was scheduled to reach Strasbourg. But a signaling error on Monday meant they briefly ended up with an unexpected view of rollercoasters. Officials aboard the train were informed that the diversion was a result of an error in the route, and they promptly shared their lighthearted take on the situation through social media. German MEP Daniel Freund joked on X: We are NOT a Mickey Mouse Parliament. Another Dutch lawmaker, Samira Rafaela, wrote Team Disneyland, in a photo posted on social media. Others tweeted that the mistake highlighted the need for EU lawmakers to just stay in Brussels and stop the regular train journeys, which take nearly four hours, for their monthly four-day plenary sessions in Strasbourg, located in eastern France near the border with Germany. Could a new Disneyland be a suitable use for the Strasbourg buildings? asked Pelle Geertsen, press aide to a Danish MEP, musing on what could happen to them if the European Parliament permanently settled in Brussels.

They should be under water, but that was before severe drought dropped the reservoir to the lowest level that Gabriel Bejarano has seen since he moved back to his grandfather's farm a decade ago. The water is supposed to come up to here, Bejarano, a veterinarian, said as he pointed toward a fence a hundred yards back from the reservoir's edge on a recent morning. The dipping level on the north shore of this lake near Toluca is a major problem for Mexico City, about 77 miles (125 kilometers) to the west. Villa Victoria -- about one-third its usual level this time of year -- and two other drought-depleted reservoirs make up most of the Cutzamala system, which serves more than 20 million people and is at a historical low for this time of year. Even more worrisome: Mexico's rainy season is just about over, and its departure will end any realistic hope of refilling the reservoirs before next year. The Mexican National Water Commission on Tuesday announced water restrictions equivalent to about 8 of the Cutzamala system's flow, and millions of users in Mexico City and Toluca fear even greater restrictions over the winter. Mexico City gets more than a quarter of its water from those reservoirs. Most of the rest is drawn from the Valley of Mexico's increasingly depleted aquifer. Neighborhoods without as many wells -- thus more reliant on the reservoirs -- will feel the shortages first and most acutely. The drought has not been limited to the valley. Seventy-five percent of Mexico is currently in drought, according to the most recent data from the country's National Meteorological Service, including extreme drought across much of Central and North Mexico and some exceptional drought in the states of Durango and San Luis Potos. The government has distributed emergency water by truck in Durango throughout the summer, plus almost 40 million liters of water across eight other drought-stricken states. Meanwhile, navigation and tourism on Lake Ptzcuaro, known for iconic Day of the Dead celebrations in the western state of Michoacn, risk drying up with increasingly low water levels. In Mexico City, it is not unusual in recent years to see some water shortages just before the rainy season. In spring 2021, Villa Victoria was at one-third its normal capacity in what then-Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum described as the city's worst drought in 30 years. But summer rains largely alleviated that drought, part of a weather pattern where warmer months typically usher in low-pressure weather systems that bring rain. But that pattern was disrupted this year as El Nio conditions created a wind shear over the Gulf of Mexico, Tereza Cavazos, an oceanography professor with the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research in Baja California, told The Associated Press. It is not possible to attribute the drier summer to climate change alone, said David K. Adams, an atmospheric scientist with Mexico's National Autonomous University, but it is entirely consistent with global patterns from a warming planet. The idea is that drying climates tend to get drier and wet climates get wetter, said Adams. Studies have shown climate change is making stronger El Nios, too. The window for rain to replenish the system is quickly closing, according to Manuel Perl Cohen, an urban planner and urbanism professor at the National Autonomous University's Institute of Social Research. The best of the rainy season is already over; Mexico's November and December rainfall is typically less than a tenth of what falls in summer months. I am sure we are going to have a shortage problem and I am sure the city will get less water and many inhabitants will suffer from that, Perl said. Fixing Mexico City's notoriously leaky water system would help in times of drought. Academics at the National Autonomous University in 2018 calculated the system leaks 5,680 gallons (21,500 liters) per second. Sheinbaum, now a leading presidential candidate, tried to address the leakage while mayor but progress has been slow. Perl said fixing what he called the world's largest and most complicated, sophisticated infrastructure for access to water will be expensive, and there has not been funding to do so. We should not be facing these kinds of situations, he said. We have enough water and we are not using it efficiently. Some advocates have suggested restoring Mexico City's last remaining natural watercourse, the Magdalena River, but that would have to contend with pollution along the river's entire length from its source west of the capital. Much of the city relies on wells that tap into the valley's groundwater. In response to the cuts on Tuesday, the government said it would drill new wells. But it may be hard to find enough water that way, especially as less water is returned to the valley's overexploited aquifer. Mexico City is a monster; it is a beast, said Adams. All the asphalt, all the plastic in the gutters means that water disappears. It never enters the system by reaching the aquifer, he said. The government is also working on a new water treatment plant at the Madn reservoir, just northwest of Mexico City, which will add 132 gallons (500 liters) per second to the Cutzamala system. That is not a medium- and long-term solution, said Perl. We cannot be living on the edge all the time. Another solution could be local-level water capture. Working with Mexico's Environment Department, Isla Urbana, a group working to improve water access in the city, has installed 10,000 rain collection systems house-by-house across the traditionally underserved southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Xochimilco. The systems gather, filter and treat rain falling on a building before storing it in a personal tank. Emilio Becerril, Isla Urbana project manager, said such rainwater harvesting could permanently change the water access situation in the face of climate change, aging infrastructure and government inertia. But a lasting solution needs institutional changes, he said. Even if you build thousands of systems, there are thousands of houses being built -- more and more extractive, said Becerril. Perl's department at the university built a four-hectare rain capture system into a playground in the southeast borough of Iztapalapa in 2018. Last month Mayor Mart Batres proposed to build thousands of rainwater harvesting systems into schools across the capital, a program Perl hopes does not succumb to the same money issues as previous government water plans. Becerril also wants to see wastewater reuse, and new infrastructure to separate stormwater from waste: an idea even he admits straddles the line between hopeful and delusional. Rain patterns are changing. It is the first year I personally have seen that clearly, said Becerril. We have gotten to the urgency point. Bejarano, the veterinarian living on the edge of the Villa Victoria reservoir, said he worries less about water for his grandfather's farm and more about younger generations like his son, who wore a Sonic the Hedgehog hoodie as his father carried him around the property in one arm. We all have children, he said. We are all affected, especially when it comes to water.  Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

(Image: screengrab from video mangirishtendulkarInstagram) A video showing rats nibbling on food inside a pantry car of the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Madgaon AC Double Decker Express has sent shockwaves through social media. The viral video, recorded by a passenger, exposes a disconcerting reality plaguing the Indian Railways - the persistent problem of unhygienic food conditions and inferior quality. Filmed by a passenger standing outside the pantry car, the footage captures two rats feasting on food left unattended in pans within the pantry car. The train in question connects Maharashtra and Goa, and the video was recorded on October 14. The passenger behind the camera, identified as Mangirish Tendulkar, a self-proclaimed fan of the railways, expressed his disbelief in an Instagram post, saying, This is such a rude shock for me as a railfan and as a train traveller. He explained that he was initially documenting the engine coupling of the train as a rail enthusiast but stumbled upon the unsettling scene. Tendulkar recalled that the pantry car, situated in the middle of the train, was overrun by rats, with at least four captured on his camera. Tendulkar's dismay did not stop with the rat-infested pantry car. When he attempted to address the issue with the Railway Protection Force (RPF), he was met with a dismissive response. Look under the track, the RPF officer purportedly said, there are 500-600 rats, out of which 5-6 are inside, so what is the problem? Tendulkar persisted and eventually reached the Assistant Station Master (Commercial), Meena, who called the pantry manager. To his astonishment, the pantry manager allegedly responded, There are many rats in the pantry, what should we do now? Tendulkar's ordeal did not end there. He lodged a complaint via the Rail Madad app and received assurances from an executive that IRCTC would be penalized. He also questioned the behaviour of railway employees, highlighting an incident where an employee in the ticket section attempted to delete the video instead of offering assistance. The video was then reshared by other accounts on X, formerly Twitter, where the official account of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) acknowledged the severity of the issue. The matter is viewed seriously and suitable action has been taken.Pantry Car Staff have been sensitised to ensure hygiene and cleanliness in the pantry car.

There is a fear that ongoing war against the outfit may escalate into a full-blown conflagration with its impact across the length and breadth of the Middle East region. Iran is raring to confront Israel, while in the wake of attacks from Lebanon and Syria on Israel, Israel's fight against Hamas has already turned into a multi-front war. Indications suggest that the Israel-Hamas war will become consequential and ruthless in days to come. But China seems to be extra cautious in its approach towards Israel's counter-action against Hamas. Historically, China has been sympathetic to the Palestinian because and as such, it has reservations in condemning Hamas attacks on Israel. However, by openly supporting Israel, Beijing also does not want to offend Islamic countries in the Middle East. In fact, the region serves as a great source of China's trade and investments. Given this, China seems to be highly worried about the unfolding situation in the region. If the ongoing Israel-Hamas war is not stopped immediately, Beijing will suffer hugely on economic, political, and strategic fronts, feel analysts. According to Xinhua, the value of overall trade between China and the Middle East countries reached 431.4 billion in 2022, up from 330 billion in 2021. The Middle East is the largest supplier of oil and gas to China. Atlantic Council, an American think tank, said in 2022, more than 41 of all crude imports to China came from the Gulf Cooperation Council, comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. Import of crude oil by China from the region rose from 145 million tons in 2006 to over 508 million tons in 2022, the American think tank said. Beyond the rubric of oil and gas, China is involved in the development of infrastructure in the region. From 2005 to 2021, China invested 36.16 billion in the UAE. In 2019, it signed a 10 billion deal with the UAE to set up a new industrial city in the Gulf country, China Briefing, a consultancy firm operating from multiple places across the world. Earlier, China built the 10 billion Yanbu refinery in Saudi Arabia. Operational since 2014, the Yanbu refinery has a capacity to refine 400,000 barrels per day of oil. China's petrochemical company Sinopec has a 37.5 stake in the Yanbu refinery, while Saudi Arabia's Aramco has a 62.5 stake in it. In August this year, on the sidelines of the Saudi-Chinese Business Forum in Beijing, Riyadh and Beijing signed a 1.33 billion deal for the development of several housing and infrastructure projects. China and Saudi Arabia inked 35 investment agreements worth around 30 billion during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Riyadh in December 2022, according to Arab News. Across Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia is a major destination for Chinese investment. Between 2005 and 2021, as per China Briefing, Beijing invested 43.47 billion in various projects in Saudi Arabia, including its rail and road projects. China is also involved in the 500 billion mega-city project, NEOM. Recently, Riyadh and Beijing set up a 20 billion investment fund to link Saudi Vision 2030 with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Oman, the third most influential country in the GCC after Saudi Arabia and the UAE, has strong bilateral economic ties with China. Beijing has invested heavily in Oman's infrastructure. It is busy in constructing Duqm port and industrial zone in the strategically located area near the Strait of Hormuz. For this project, China and Oman signed a 10.7 billion agreement in May 2016. The project is a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Between 2005 and 2021, China invested 1.42 billion in Bahrain's infrastructure projects, China Briefing said. But it does not include multi-billion worth of projects underway in Bahrain under BRI. In accordance with Bahrain's economic vision for 2030, Chinese companies are involved in the Bahrain Metro Railway Project, East Sitra Housing Project and Al Dur Power Station Project. As per Bahrain's The Daily Tribune, the East Sitra Housing Project being developed by China Machinery Engineering Corporation will be the largest social housing project in the Gulf country. It is being developed by reclaiming 720,000 square metres of land, The Daily Tribune said. Kuwait has also attracted a large number of investments from China under BRI. The first phase of the 130 billion Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmed Al Sabah Causeway -- connecting Kuwait's capital with its northern shores has been completed. Work is on connecting Kuwait's capital with five nearby islands. Kuwait Times said that more than 40 Chinese firms are currently operating in Kuwait as part of China's contributions towards national development projects, related to smart cities, energy, ports, road, and rail. Last month, during the visit of Kuwaiti Crown Prince Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to Hangzhou to participate in the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games, the two countries signed seven agreements for construction of projects related to Mubarak Al-Kabeer Port, renewable energy, creation of a low-carbon recycling green system, water treatment station, economic free zones In Qatar, China has enhanced its footprint both in energy and infrastructure sectors. In April this year, Chinese petroleum firm Sinopec agreed to take 5 take in a train with a processing capacity of 8 million tons a year. It is part of the North Field East LNG export project that is under construction and is expected to begin shipping gas in 2026, Bloomberg said. Qatar has aligned its national vision for 2030 with China's BRI with a special focus on the energy sector. Following a deal with Beijing in June 2023, Qatar agreed to supply four million tons of gas annually to China, The Jordan Times said. In 2021, as per Xinhua, bilateral trade between China and Qatar reached a high point of 17 billion, up 57 compared to 2020. In the first three months of 2022, the two-way trade rose by 19.5 billion, China's state-backed news agency said. On the infrastructure front, Lusail Stadium which was the host to the 22nd FIFA World Cup last year, is considered as a signature construction work of China Railway Construction Corporation. It had won a 764 million contract to build the stadium. China was also involved in building Qatar's other stadiums like Education City Stadium and Stadium 974. From sea ports to strategic reservoirs, energy, and communication projects -- there are multiple projects in which more than 200 Chinese companies are currently involved in Qatar, Global Times said. China's engagements with non-GCC countries on trade and investments have been equally strong and forward-looking. In Iran, China has agreed to invest 400 billion over 25 years in exchange for a steady supply of oil to feed the engine of its growth. The New York Times said promised 400 billion Chinese investments will be made in dozens of fields, including banking, telecommunications, ports, railways, health care and information technology. China's investments in Iraq and Syria have grown significantly in recent years. However, along with economically oriented moves across the Middle East, China has been seen taking a well-calculated step to increase its political influence in the region. Its reflection can be seen in its mediation in the normalisation of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran. By successfully bringing two of the Middle East's bitterest rivals to the negotiating table, China aims to build credibility as a capable partner in the region, Carnegie Endowment For International Peace said in a recent article. To enhance its influence among the countries of the region, Beijing helped push the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Iran to become BRICS members at the group's summit in Johannesburg in August this year. In the China-dominated Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Iran has already become a member, while dialogue partner status has been granted to Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Kuwait. But there is a fear that once Israel targets Iran for its support to Hamas or Tehran attacks Israel in its support of the Palestinian because, there will be no stopping from turning the current Israel-Hamas fight into a full-blown war, taking the Middle Eastern countries in its avoidable infernos. If that happens, China will be a great loser, experts say.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israel's war against Hamas is going on full throttle with the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) claiming to kill hundreds of terrorists by bombing their hideouts in Gaza.

Biden is scheduled to remain in Tel Aviv for his visit, which will include a bilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Biden plans to deliver public remarks, Kirby said, and he will also meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, as well as first responders, families who lost loved ones in the attack and families whose relatives Hamas may be holding hostage in Gaza. Netanyahu extended the invitation to Biden after Hamas' terrorist attack in Israel on October 7, which killed 1,400 people. On his way back to the YOU.S. on Wednesday, Biden is expected to speak with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in discussions likely to focus on a path forward in Gaza as Israeli military leaders consider next steps and Palestinian civilians call for humanitarian aid. Biden initially planned to meet with Arab leaders at a summit hosted by Jordan's King Abdullah in Amman, but the event was canceled following an explosion at a Christian-run medical complex in central Gaza City that is estimated to have killed hundreds. Israeli and Palestinian authorities blamed each other for the fatal blast. Follow live coverage from NBC News here. NBC News reported Tuesday that Biden's team earlier in the week was considering the idea of his visiting Israel. One of the conditions was that the visit needed to take place before Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza, according to multiple current and former administration officials. It is the second time during Biden's presidency that he has visited a war zone. In February, he traveled to Ukraine in a trip that was kept quiet until he arrived. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been engaging in shuttle diplomacy across the Middle East over the past week, meeting with Arab leaders from multiple countries.

Recent years have yielded headline-worthy ransomware attacks on domestic industry and critical infrastructure including malicious operations by foreign threat actors. The risk of public, costly, and potentially crippling incidents is on the rise, as is risk mitigation. Examples of real or potential threats paint a stark picture. In May 2021, criminal hackers launched a ransomware cyberattack on American oil company Colonial Pipeline. The attack on this often-overlooked means of surface transportation resulted in a multi-million-dollar ransom payment in just hours. The impact included a reported six-day shutdown of the company's operating systems. The federal government publicly ramped up directives around cybersecurity in an effort to raise industry awareness and instill best practices in subsequent years. In March of 2021, President Biden signed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act into law. The Act applies broadly to covered entities identified as critical to infrastructure across sectors. The Act requires that covered entities report certain cybersecurity incidents to the YOU.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours and report ransomware payments to CISA within just 24 hours. In February 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine stepped up the urgency of cybersecurity matters and particularly their impact on the global supply chain. CISA issued a public warning regarding the risk of Russian cyberattacks against YOU.S. networks in retaliation for YOU.S. sanctions. By March, the White House issued intelligence-based warnings that Russia is considering engaging in cyberattacks against domestic YOU.S. interests. Private industry is viewed as critical to CISA's Shields Up strategy to prepare for and respond to cyberattacks. Transportation and logistics as a sector may be particularly vulnerable to attack due to its essential character in all manner of industry and its voluminous interconnected relationships around the world (often with antiquated systems). Domestically, the Transportation Services Administration (TSA) stands at the forefront of the cybersecurity issue for the transportation sector. Following the Colonial Pipeline attack in 2022, the TSA issued a Security Directive under its emergency authority. The Directive required pipeline owners and operators to: (1) report actual and potential cybersecurity incidents to CISA; (2) designate a Cybersecurity Coordinator to serve as a point person between a service provider and the TSA who is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week; (3) review current practices applicable to cybersecurity; and (4) identify vulnerability in cybersecurity and develop a plan to address cybersecurity risks and report the results to TSA and CISA. The TSA later updated its guidance to require additional measures including: (1) implementation of mitigation measures to protect against ransomware and IT attacks; (2) implementation of a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan; and (3) conducting a cybersecurity architecture design review. The TSA's attention quickly spread to other modalities under its jurisdiction. The Administration issued similar directives for other segments including the railroad industry and for public transportation. The published Security Directives were designed to target higher-risk freight railroads, passenger rail, and public bus transportation. The operational framework largely mirrors the pipeline industry: (1) reporting cybersecurity incidents to CISA; (2) designation of a round-the-clock cybersecurity coordinator; (3) developing a cybersecurity incident response plan; and (4) developing a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment to identify gaps in security. The TSA has since continued its urgent cybersecurity initiatives. Most recently, in March 2023, it issued new cybersecurity amendments on an emergency basis to TSA-regulated airport and aircraft operators requiring updates to their security programs. Other new federal programs outside the jurisdiction of transportation agencies have direct impact on the sector. The White House has introduced a Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) initiative designed to promote the sharing of critical freight information between different supply chain participants. The digital infrastructure of FLOW is intended to strengthen supply chains by facilitating more frequent and more accurate information. The objective is to reduce COVID-type disruptions and guard against interference through cybersecurity vulnerabilities and other threats. The initial participants in FLOW include the YOU.S. Department of Transportation and the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, as well as the Georgia Ports Authority, terminal operators, private businesses and logistics and warehousing providers. Private participants are reported to include Nike Inc., Albertsons Companies., Target Corp., Walmart Inc., Union Pacific Corp., FedEx Corp., and Maersk. Just as modern supply chains are global, these cyber concerns and mitigation efforts are not unique to the YOU.S. On December 14, 2022, the European Parliament issued a Directive on measures for a high level of cybersecurity across the E.YOU. The Directive designated as sectors of high criticality key industry hubs and participants including airports, airlines, traffic control authorities, ports, port equipment operators, and shipping lines. Each of those identified will be required under the Directive to put together an incident response team with resources and technical capabilities to handle cybersecurity threats real-time. The Directive also bolstered reporting requirements incumbent on companies that suffered a cybersecurity attack by requiring the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) to develop rules for measuring and handling cybersecurity readiness and to develop a template for incident response. The global effort against nefarious actors, and the well-being of private industry, requires vigilant day-to-day practices in order to be effective. Our industry has long concerned itself with operational best practices for achieving key metrics such as on-time delivery. It is now time to also give attention to building tech-savvy teams that can conduct nuanced vulnerability reviews to address the receipt of critical data, including personal information, and the personnel who can access it. Scrutiny of owned and leased systems that process critical data, including through cloud-based applications, and to the technical and organizational controls in place to protect such data, is often a key point of internal risk assessment together with the contractual relationships supporting those systems. While that exercise may be familiar, the need to act on information is evolving. An emerging development is the criticality of ensuring that teams have the tools and skills to report and act upon incidents promptly. Current operational best practices include maintaining an incident response plan and conducting annual training regarding the plan. The importance of the transportation and logistics industry is increasingly under review from a global competitiveness, national security, and domestic safety perspective. This is positive for a segment that has long viewed itself as the backbone of the YOU.S. and, at least since the COVID-19 pandemic, is widely known across the country as holding that role. Along with that newfound visibility and esteem comes a call to action. The industry, like many other sectors, must remain on guard against the crippling effects that could all too easily be brought about by our enemies.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Cybersecurity vulnerability is emerging as a top-of-mind issue for transportation and logistics service providers, regulators, and criminals alike.

Both appear to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, according to AIS data. The first suspect is the Chinese boxship NewNew Polar Bear, which recently transited the Northern Sea Route, making headlines for the crossing. The other ship is the Russian government-operated LASH carrier Sevmorput, the last nuclear-powered cargo vessel in the world. On Wednesday, the two vessels were named by Finland's National Bureau of Investigation as subjects of an inquiry into the because of the pipeline breach, along with other unnamed ships. An open-source analysis of AIS data (above) suggests that Sevmorput crossed over the pipeline at about 0112 on the morning of the 8th, followed by NewNew Polar Bear a few minutes later. This was about the same timeframe as a faint seismic event in the area, which was detected by a Finnish monitoring station and classed as a possible explosion or a large gas release. An ROV investigation found evidence of mechanical impact or mechanical destruction of the pipeline, according to Estonian authorities. The exact because is still under investigation. NewNew Polar Bear has been under surveillance ever since. According to Reuters, the Norwegian coast guard vessel KV Sortland tracked the Chinese boxship as it headed northward past Norway's offshore oil and gas fields.

Please try again later verifyErrors  Packaging from a UK supermarket has been dumped 7,000 miles away in a low-income township in Myanmar - raising troubling questions about how the West's outsized plastic pollution crisis is being forced upon vulnerable communities with little ability to push back. Labels and plastic wrapping for bottled water and diet lemonade from a Lidl in Lichfield were discovered in the piles of festering garbage which engulf low-income areas of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. Lidl's plastic waste was found in a sea of foreign trash in Shwe Pyi Thar township that also included items from companies in France, Poland and Canada. The plastic waste was collected by journalists from the independent news organisation Frontier during a six-month investigation into dumping in Myanmar. The Independent is publishing the findings in partnership with Lighthouse Reports, a collaborative newsroom working with media outlets in six countries. The Lidl packaging was found in Shwe Pyi Thar's Ward 27, an informal community of 700 squatters on the outskirts of the township who fear speaking up due to the threat of eviction. Around half of the 180 tiny, tightly-packed bamboo huts are flooded with sewage, according to the investigative team. Threats in Myanmar have escalated since a coup two years ago by a military junta which violently cracked down on protest and free speech. Another informal settlement near Yangon, Ward 17, was bulldozed last year with one day's notice. Shwe Pyi Thar residents spoke anonymously to Frontier Myanmar journalists for fear of reprisal. Some locals said they had been coerced by local strong men to sign agreements allowing plastic waste to be dumped next to their homes. Locals described fetid air in their homes, and how the trash often catches fire, releasing hazardous fumes. During monsoon season, the plastic waste, which clogs sewers and streams, makes flooding much worse. When there is a dump site, people think they can throw their garbage there as well and they do, said Daw Aye Mi, a married mother-of-two, who used a pseudonym. After that the garbage floats down waterways to other residential areas. The water becomes dirty and dark. When we touch the water, our legs become itchy. During the interview, she showed sores on her legs to Frontier reporters. Daw Aye Mi said that she worried about her children falling in the dirty water and warned them not to play in the garbage. However, there was little she could do to stop the waste being dumped on Myanmar residents, some of which comes from overseas. We are squatters, she said. If the government comes to demolish the huts, we will have to move so we cannot tell them not to throw garbage here. Frontier journalists found Danone brand Oikos yogurt pots, and packaging from Canadian brand Unico Penne Rigate, Poland's Kasztelan beer and cheese brand, Spomlek. None of these companies supply to Myanmar. A Danone spokesperson said: We were disappointed to see the findings of the Lighthouse Report. Danone does not export any of its waste across the globe. The Independent has contacted Carlsberg Poland, which owns the Kasztelan brand, along with Spomlek and Unico for comment but has yet to receive a response. The largest amount of plastic waste found by Frontier reporters came from Lidl UK. The printed labels named a Lidl warehouse in Lichfield, north of Birmingham, suggesting it was disposed of directly by the company rather than customers. The labels were found alongside water bottles from Roxane UK, a Lichfield-based supplier of Lidl UK. Lidl, a low-price supermarket chain from Germany with stores across Europe and the US, highlighted its green credentials in a statement to The Independent. As founding members of the UK Plastic Pact, we are committed to a circular future for plastics, diligently working to reduce plastic usage, enhance recyclability, and promote circularity in our materials as part of our REset Plastic targets, the company wrote in an email. All our plastic waste is processed in the UK and Lidl has a strict policy against sending waste or recyclables to any country in Asia. We are therefore naturally disappointed to see this and will be investigating in close collaboration with our waste management partners. A former member of Lidl's sustainability team told Lighthouse Reports that the supermarket's plastic being found in Myanmar was shocking. There is some responsibility on the brand, either their contractor or supplier is not doing the required checks and balances for waste management. It is particularly shocking that it is ending up in Myanmar, a very vulnerable country where many companies are debating about whether to do business, the source said. Lidl is also bound by European and international waste trade regulations like the Basel Convention which states that countries can only export uncontaminated waste destined for recycling, and not to dump. And yet, the rubbish found in Myanmar is not recyclable material. With these regulations in mind, Jim Puckett, executive director of environmental advocacy group Basel Action Network, told The Independent that Lidl's packaging was likely illegally exported to Myanmar by a third party. He pointed out that companies usually do not handle their own shipments and hire a separate waste management company. Something went wrong, said Mr Puckett. How is it that plastic waste from the English Midlands ends up in a township in southeast Asia? The answer lies somewhere in the global recycling supply chain - an opaque, Byzantine system riddled with contradictory regulations, loopholes and corruption. Laws intended to stop illegal dumping of plastic waste are proving toothless in reality, the investigation found. Official data from 23 countries showed that 143,000 tonnes of plastic waste was exported to Myanmar in the past five years, according to Comtrade, the United Nations global trade data platform. However, the investigation found there was likely much more entering the country because Comtrade does not cross-check or verify the data it gathers. China's ban on plastic imports in 2018 saw an explosion in shipments to Southeast Asia from the West. But public backlash has meant that Thailand, Viet Nam, and Malaysia, are gradually introducing their own national plastic bans. While this may have begun to solve the problem for some countries, greater volumes of plastic waste are now ending up in more vulnerable places with little capacity to deal with it. Under Myanmar's domestic laws, the only plastic waste that should be imported is uncontaminated, recycling-ready shreds or pellets. But the problem is telling the difference in thousands of shipments - a tricky task for which there is little will or capacity along the supply chain. Recycling companies in Myanmar also told the investigative team that they would prefer to buy foreign plastic waste - even if much had to be sent to landfill or burned - as it is typically higher quality than what is available domestically. For imported waste we have to buy the whole container and in the container there is a lot of mixed waste, said Win Tun Tun, a recycler in Myanmar, who used a pseudonym. We cannot return unusable waste, we have to dispose of it. The investigative team found that the porous 1,500-mile border between Thailand and Myanmar is allowing a vast flow of illegal plastics. Established routes for trafficking drugs and people are being used to smuggle plastic waste, a trade lubricated by weak law enforcement, political instability and poverty. Overland shipments get less scrutiny than what arrives at maritime ports, and sources told the investigative team that border officials could be bribed in order to bring banned plastic into Myanmar. It was also discovered that a number of western countries are using Thailand as a middle-man. An Interpol survey of national law enforcement agencies found that 60 per cent reported an increase in illegal waste shipments using transit countries to obscure their routes since China's plastic ban five years ago. Myanmar can ill-afford this influx: the country is already drowning in 2,000 tonnes of plastic waste that it generates within its own borders each day, only 11 per cent of which gets recycled, the investigation found. The world's addiction to plastic is being fuelled by the fossil-fuel industry as it seeks out ways to sell more oil in the face of booming renewable energy and electric cars. Plastics account for 3.4 percent of global emissions to date, a figure that is expected to more than double by 2060. Hundreds of millions of tonnes of plastic are produced annually with most being used in rich countries. The average American uses 560lbs of new plastics every year while a person in sub-Saharan Africa uses less than one-tenth of that, according to OECD's 2022 Global Plastics Outlook. Yet only 9 per cent of plastic is being recycled around the world. Half ends up in landfill, and one-fifth is incinerated. Another 22 per cent is burned in open pits or dumped, especially in poorer countries. The more you dig into the recycling of plastic, and plastics in general, you realize that it is really a sham, Mr Puckett said. It is very difficult and costly to recycle plastic as it is not that valuable, so the margins are low. The price of virgin plastic is so cheap right now that huge quantities of these shipments to places like Myanmar will be dumped or burned because there is no market for a lot of the polymers, especially if they are dirty. Next month 175 countries will gather in Nairobi to hammer out the first, legally-binding global treaty on plastic pollution intended to go into effect by the end of 2024. While some environmental campaigners are optimistic that the pact could ban high-risk plastics like those for single-use or with hazardous additives, and improve waste management, others are concerned that it will be another global agreement rendered futile by powerful interests. Petrochemicals are expected to account for more than a third of growth in global oil demand this decade, and nearly half of growth by 2050, adding nearly 7 million barrels of oil a day by mid-century, according to the International Energy Agency. But the fossil fuel industry is going to have to sell the world on the idea that plastic is circular, Mr Puckett noted. It is a pitch that may strain credulity as images emerge of children playing knee-deep in mounds of rotting plastic in Myanmar and beyond. It is going to be very much a public relations battle to try to convince us all that recycling works, Mr Puckett said. And the more you look at it, you realize no, it does not.

Schools closed and many businesses and homes were forced to evacuate as major flooding destroyed their belongings. As Cork deals with the aftermath of yesterday's apocalyptic scenes with a massive clean up operation taking place today, Co Kerry has been placed under a status yellow rain warning. Weather bosses warned of heavy downpours from 6pm this evening until 6pm tomorrow, with high rainfall levels. Possible impacts include flooding, reduced visibility and dangerous road conditions. Northern Ireland will also experience disruption with a status yellow rain alert issued for Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry. Storm Babet will bring disruptive conditions to Northern Ireland this morning. Cork has been badly affected by power outages, with ESB yesterday confirming that almost 1,000 properties are without electricity. ESB crews are today working to restore power in the affected areas. Met Eireann forecaster Matthew Martin said Ireland should expect unsettled weather for the next few days. Pinpointing wet areas, Mr Martin said the rain will become confined to Ulster and Connacht by midday. Heavy bursts tonight will land particularly in the west of the country, with some mist and fog developing. Met Eireann chiefs said: Further outbreaks of rain on Friday, again with the potential for heavy and prolonged falls leading to localised flooding. Turning cooler across the north of the country with highs of 10 to 12 degrees, afternoon temperatures ranging 13 to 16 degrees elsewhere. Outbreaks of rain on Friday night will gradually clear south with drier and cooler conditions spreading from the north. Patchy rain in the south is likely to clear during Saturday morning to leave a day of sunny spells and passing showers. Clear spells and just isolated showers on Saturday night. Rather cold with some mist or fog patches forming. Lowest temperatures of 4 to 7 degrees with mostly light westerly breezes. It looks set to be mostly dry on Sunday with plenty of autumnal sunshine and just the odd passing shower. Many areas are expected to be dry on Sunday night but there is the chance of some patchy rain in the south later. A chilly night for many with lowest temperatures of 2 to 6 degrees, but milder in southern coastal counties. Early indications suggest Monday will be largely dry with some sunshine but there is the chance of a spell of rain developing in the south later. People across Ireland have been urged to take care on the roads, with some completely impassable. Cork County Council said: Please take care if travelling this morning.

The bridge is a key supply route for Russia's forces and Moscow's sole land link with Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by President Vladimir Putin in 2014. Ukraine struck the 19-kilometer (12-mile) road and rail bridge in October 2022 and again in July. The bridge, which has a four-lane roadway for vehicles and a railway bridge with two tracks, is crucial to sustaining Moscow's military offensives in southern Ukraine. Satellite photos obtained by Newsweek show that the railway was damaged by Kyiv's second strike. The YOU.K. Ministry of Defense said in its intelligence update on Thursday that Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin had declared the damage from the July strike had been repaired ahead of schedule. Although fully operational, use of the bridge remains restricted due to procedures enacted following the first Ukrainian attack in October 2022. Trucks and fuel supplies continue to be moved by ferry, defense officials said. Although the bridge will remain a vital link in sustaining Russia's occupation of Crimea and its forces in southern Ukraine, the YOU.K. officials said, it is now almost certainly a significant security burden requiring multi-domain protection, including the use of air defence systems and crews who would otherwise be deployed elsewhere. The defense ministry added: Russian security forces' confidence in their ability to protect this large and vulnerable structure will continue to be threatened by the ingenuity of Ukraine's military and security services. Newsweek has contacted Russia's Foreign Ministry for comment via email. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, former commanding general of United States Army Europe, told Newsweek the targeting of the bridge was part of Kyiv's multi-domain counteroffensive to reclaim occupied territories, including Crimea. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged to reverse Russia's annexation of Crimea. The counteroffensive is so much more than just the ground part where they are going through the minefields in the trenches. That is an important part. But it is a part that I think is aimed at severing the so-called land bridge, Hodges said. This is all part of making Crimea untenable, unusable for the Russian military, until the Ukrainians have enough combat power where they can actually liberate the peninsula, Hodges said. So it is kind of three steps. One is isolation. Number two is make it untenable so that the Black Sea fleet has to reposition, that the Russian Air Force has to reposition, that Russian logistics have to reposition away from Crimea.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The bridge is a key supply route for Russia's forces and Moscow's sole land link with Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by President Vladimir Putin in 2014.

Melissa Horton Horton, 43, was killed on March 18 in Bartlett. Two deputies from the Shelby County Sheriff's Office pulled over her vehicle after learning from the Fayette County Sheriff's Office that she had attempted to shoot her fianc. When the deputies commanded Horton to exit the car, she lifted a shotgun and pointed it at one of the deputies. The deputies fired, killing Horton.

A moment later, an officer yells something about a shotgun and the two officers back away from the car while firing multiple shots. Latoris Taylor Taylor, 40, was killed on December 9 in the Westwood neighborhood of Memphis. According to a news release from the Shelby County District Attorney's Office, he was seen in a stolen car and ran as a Memphis police officer approached in his patrol car. That officer chased Taylor on foot, during which Taylor turned and fired two shots at the officer, who returned fire, killing Taylor, according to the news release. Officer body-camera video shows an officer exiting his vehicle, running, then firing several shots. Video from a security camera in the neighborhood shows a man running, firing at someone behind him, then dropping to the ground in a front yard, presumably shot. A large number of officers quickly arrive on the scene and approach the man. Corey Brewer Brewer, 45, was killed June 3, 2022 at Interstate 40 and Whitten. He was wanted in connection with a fatal shooting of a woman earlier that day at an Amazon warehouse in Horn Lake.

(AP) - Several days before a Norfolk Southern conductor trainee was killed by a metal beam protruding from a parked railcar on the next track, workers at a YOU.S. Pipe facility noticed the beam was hanging off the top of the car but never told the railroad about it, federal investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board released those details this week in a report on the interviews it conducted after Walter James Griffin was killed near Bessemer, Alabama, on December 13. Investigators will not release their final report on the death until later. The accident happened as Griffin's train was passing another train that was in the process of picking up several cars that had been parked on a siding, including ones loaded with scrap metal from YOU.S. Pipe's nearby facility. The beam struck Griffin in the head as it smashed into the locomotive he was riding in and injured the conductor sitting behind him with broken glass. The death was one of the incidents the NTSB cited when it announced it would conduct a broad investigation into Norfolk Southern's safety practices after a fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. That February derailment prompted a national reckoning on rail safety and calls for reforms. NTSB investigators interviewed the crews of both trains and YOU.S. Pipe workers and reviewed security videos in the days after the Alabama accident. Video taken on December 7 showed a piece of metal hanging off the top of the railcar at YOU.S. Pipe's facility. At one point, a worker there even put up caution tape around the railcar because of the metal hanging off of it. But that caution tape was gone before Norfolk Southern's crew arrived to pick up the car. This incident was a tragedy, and our thoughts remain with Mr. Griffins family, friends, and colleagues. Were continuing to work closely with the NTSB as they complete their investigation, the railroad said in a statement. It declined to answer questions about the accident because of the ongoing investigation. YOU.S. Pipe officials did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday. Griffin's family sued Norfolk Southern in the spring over his death. That lawsuit remains pending. Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest freight railroads, operating in the eastern United States.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"NTSB: Workers at YOU.S. Pipe facility noticed metal beam days before accident.

Wednesday was a testing day for people living in the path of Storm Babet, which disrupted quite a few areas. Cork got a particularly bad lash from the storm, as readers are no doubt aware. If your smartphone was working yesterday, you probably saw the footage which was being uploaded from all over Cork. That footage showed scenes which custom dictates we describe as unprecedented and shocking, but they were also frightening, to be honest. Streets were flooded in and around Cork, with people reporting areas which had never been flooded before being inundated. There was traffic gridlock in many parts of the city during the day and it was clear that some cars had simply been abandoned in rising waters. People who had commuted to work could not get back home, or got back home hours later than usual; both rail and bus services in Cork were seriously affected by the weather. The litany of black spots is depressing, and in some cases depressingly familiar: Blackpool flooded, for instance, but so did Glanmire village and roads were impassable in Ballyvolane, Rochestown, Blarney, Tower, and elsewhere. The Straight Rd flooded when the Lee itself burst its banks. East Cork suffered severely. The Defence Forces were called in to help people in Midleton, which was simply impassable, its main street under several feet of water and dozens of premises flooded. Killeagh was flooded a few miles further east, while the Ladysbridge-Cloyne road was a no-go zone, damaged by floodwater. At the border of Cork and Waterford, the walls were collapsing along one stretch of the N25 by the sea outside Youghal. This morning, aprs le dluge, the questions arise, naturally enough. For instance, Met ireann issued an orange warning for Cork (given before expected weather conditions that could significantly impact people, property, and activity in an area, according to met.ie). Should that have been a red warning (rarely issued but when it is, people in the areas expected to be affected should take action to protect themselves andor their properties)? On the basis of their own definitions, a red warning should have been issued for Cork. As reported here, Met ireann will be issuing fewer Status Yellow weather warnings in future, with the forecaster set to re-evaluate the thresholds for such warnings as it acknowledged concerns about warning fatigue from the public. Unfortunately, that was a little late for Cork this week. A red warning yesterday morning would have closed schools and immediately cut the number of journeys being made; as it turned out, some schools made the decision to close early anyway, but that meant parents had to make the journey to collect children at the height of the rainstorm. It is also clear that people commuted to work in the belief that an orange warning heralded testing but not dangerous weather -- only to find conditions far more perilous later in the day. Another question: Is it acceptable that a 21st-century city should be so seriously affected by heavy rainfall? One of the traditional replies on Leeside to such queries is to point out that for hundreds of years the low-slung city of Cork, central marshy island and all, has been susceptible to riverine flooding at high tides, a victim of its own geography. Yet the obvious retort is that if this has been common knowledge for hundreds of years, surely it is past time for a solution. Instead, there have been years of uncertainty and dispute about a proposed flood defence scheme, with no sign of progress while the city is literally inundated. It should be acknowledged that the amount of rain which fell yesterday was calamitous -- by some measures a month's rainfall fell in approximately 24 hours. That amount of rain would test the best-prepared drainage systems. Can we say that yesterday was exceptional as well as calamitous, however? Climate change is likely to produce more such events, not fewer. And if those future events occur on the same scale, as is widely expected, then a different response will be needed. Multi-agency approach A co-ordinated, multi-agency approach involving municipal and State agencies will be necessary if lives are not going to be lost in future extreme weather events. Are we going to need a Cork rain tsar, a single figure who will take temporary control of the city when it is in danger of being flooded to pull the various agencies together? Would not that be better than what we experienced yesterday? Looking into the future means seeing where other headaches are likely to occur down the line. We have seen in recent years, for instance, that there are ambitious plans for developing and expanding Cork -- to create an entirely new suburb, more or less, down on the Docklands-Marina area. But how meaningful can those plans be if the area itself or adjacent arteries such as the Centre Park and Monahan Roads are likely to flood, as happened yesterday? Or if the entire city can be paralysed by heavy rain? Ambitions of Cork acting as some kind of regional counterbalance to the concentration of population and resources in Dublin are laudable. However, based on this week, it looks like they will not survive their first encounter with prolonged rainfall. Credit must be given to those who defied the elements yesterday to help others. The people who helped neighbours and friends stranded in cars by rising waters. Those who were invited into bars and restaurants for shelter and food, particularly in the Midleton area. Sarsfields Hurling Club in Glanmire opened the gates to its main playing field to let flood water run off which would otherwise have flooded local homes and businesses. The club, which won the Cork senior hurling title just last Sunday, explained their motivation in a statement: As a result, our main pitch essentially became a flood plain in order to relieve the flooding to the immediate Riverstown area, Orchard Manor, and surrounding businesses. We won a county, lost a pitch, but hopefully saved a part of the Glanmire community. Those are the gestures which show what a community really is. Sars' actions were proactive and decisive, qualities much in demand yesterday -- and not on show everywhere they were needed -- but the city as a whole cannot rely on the spontaneous generosity of voluntary organisations. This week's events must be seen as the turning point. Cork needs that specific plan with a local focus, preferably managed by an individual with the authority and power to co-ordinate the various bodies involved when the floods threaten again. And to overrule central assumptions on the basis of local evidence, if need be. If not, then the city can be expected to grind to a halt again when the next rainstorm hits. Or squelch to a halt, to be more accurate. A co-ordinated multi-agency approach involving municipal and State agencies will be necessary if lives are not going to be lost in future",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Wednesday was a testing day for people living in the path of Storm Babet.

An Oregon man who sexually assaulted women inmates while working as a nurse at a correctional facility was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in prison, federal prosecutors said.

Prosecutors had asked for a 41-year sentence. Seventeen women testified against Klein at trial. Some said he forced them to have sex, while others said they believed they could face discipline if they refused his advances, the Associated Press reported when he was convicted.

Jim Jordan's supporters is sparking backlash from Republican holdouts, making it harder for him to become the next House speaker. Several GOP lawmakers, as well as one member's spouse, have reported a barrage of calls and messages pushing them to back Jordan, R-Ohio, in his struggling candidacy. One even said she is received death threats. Rep. Don Bacon's wife this week has received anonymous, threatening text messages pressuring her to persuade her husband to support Jordan. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., said his staffers have been cussed out in phone calls from Jordan supporters. And Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said he was so upset with pro-Jordan robocalls to voters in his South Florida district that he personally told Jordan to call off the attack dogs. On Wednesday night, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, said in a statement that she would received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls after she switched her vote to another Republican during the second-round vote. Jordan's foes, who for the past two days have blocked him from winning the speaker's gavel, are facing an aggressive pressure campaign from the Ohio Republican's allies and conservative grassroots activists to stop their opposition and flip to yes. But the bloc of roughly 20 anti-Jordan Republicans say they are not caving and that those hardball tactics from Jordan allies are actually backfiring. One thing I cannot stomach, or support is a bully, Miller-Meeks said in a statement, adding that she will not be intimidated. Someone who threatens another with bodily harm or tries to suppress differing opinions undermines opportunity for unity and regard for freedom of speech. In a post on the social media site X, Jordan condemned the violent threats and called for them to stop: No American should accost another for their beliefs. We condemn all threats against our colleagues and it is imperative that we come together. Stop. It is abhorrent. Moments after Jordan was rejected on a second ballot for speaker Wednesday, Gimenez recounted a tense phone call with Jordan a day earlier. Robocalls -- they are not free. So somebody is actually funding this. And then he told me that he was not behind it and he is asked people to stop. But if you have asked people to stop it, why are not they listening to you? Gimenez told reporters just off the House floor. I told him 'I do not really take well to threats' ... Matter of fact, if you threaten me, I would probably go the other way, he continued. I probably head into the wind, not away from the wind, because if you succumb to threats and intimidation and all that, the rest of your life you will just be threatened and intimidated. Speaker nominees typically use carrots -- including subcommittee gavels, seats on powerful panels and fundraising promises -- to win over skeptics. It was a strategy deployed by California Republican Kevin McCarthy, the consummate insider, to secure the speaker's gavel in January. But with the speaker vacancy happening in the middle of the session, Jordan has few carrots to hand out. Jordan's struggles emphasize the degree to which his rise is owed to his outside game, such as his talents for activating the conservative grassroots, making a splash on right-wing media and lighting up social networks with passionate GOP-leaning voters. His struggles also expose the weaknesses of his inside game, such as member-to-member relations and balancing fragile coalitions -- skills that have historically been staples of successful speakers. It is terrible. I dare say you are not really a Jordan ally if those are the tactics you are using, because it is just completely counterproductive, said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, a Jordan supporter. Sticks will not work with these people, Crenshaw added. I asked a lot of those original 20 against McCarthy who might think sticks work. But I am like, it did not work on you! It is not going to work on them either. One close Jordan ally, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, said his colleague has tried to turn down the heat but that outside pressure always exists in speaker's races, including McCarthy's back in January. Jordan spokesman Russell Dye said the congressman is not behind any of the attacks on his detractors and has called for them to stop. Mr. Jordan has not made any threats, or encouraged any attacks on any members voting against him, or encouraged any attacks in any way. Neither has our team, Dye said. The Jordan defectors are not buying it. I think he is absolutely responsible for it, said Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., who said his office has been inundated with aggressive calls from Jordan supporters. It does not work. Nobody likes to have their arm twisted or talking about individual's wives ... That is just not acceptable. Bacon's wife, Angie, this week began receiving text messages from unknown numbers, pressing her to try to flip her husband's vote to yes. Why is your husband causing chaos by not supporting Jim Jordan, begins one of the texts Bacon shared with NBC News. Your husband will never hold elected office again, the sender wrote, when Bacon's wife asked them to identify themselves. Tell your husband to step up and be leader, reads another text shared by Bacon. More publicly, conservative media stars, including Sean Hannity of Fox News and Steve Bannon, host of the The War Room, a livestreamed show, have also been urging the holdouts to back Jordan. But the pressure campaign is clearly not having the desired effect, with Jordan losing 20 Republican votes Tuesday and 22 on Wednesday. To be elected speaker, he can afford no more than four GOP defections in his quest for the 217 votes needed to win. Jordan is headed for defeat. He will fight to death likely, and we will not let off, Bacon told NBC News on Wednesday. Their tactics angered us. They are harassing our spouses even. Jordan hit a brick wall. Womack, one of the handful of House appropriators who have voted against Jordan, said his staffers have been dealing with continuous profanity-laced phone calls from supporters furious about Womack's no votes. They have been cussed out. They have been threatened. I am not talking bodily threatened, they have just basically said very unkind things to my team. And it is been nonstop, a furious Womack told reporters. And most of these are out-of-state calls; very few of them are from my district. ... But when my staff has to absorb the brunt of this, you know, kind of verbal assault, then that is just unacceptable. These tactics will not work with us. If the whole battle plan was to attack them, give him time to expose those members and go after them, then it is an abject failure, Womack added. They did not read the room very well, and they do not know these members very well.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Rep.

President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the other team was behind the blast, citing data he had been shown by the YOU.S. Defense Department. Preliminary estimates of deaths at Al Ahli Arab Hospital vary from 200 to 800, World Health Organization officials said at an emergency press conference late Tuesday. Injuries were estimated to be in the hundreds as well. Aside from patients and health care workers, many civilians were also sheltering in and around the hospital, expecting it to be spared from attacks, as mandated by international humanitarian law. Palestinian officials had been quick to say it was an Israeli airstrike, but the Israel Defense Forces say that intelligence traces the attack to a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. As he met with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday, Biden said it appeared as though the attack was done by the other team, according to multiple news outlets. But before Biden departed for the meeting, the YOU.S. government had not yet drawn a conclusion as to who was to blame for the bombing, CNN reported Wednesday, citing an anonymous YOU.S. official. The question of who was behind the attack has massive implications, with the Arab world in particular on edge, with protests in support of Palestine in many neighboring countries. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was midair during the organization's emergency press conference Tuesday, but expressed his shock and condemnation through Dr. Michael Ryan, the organization's executive director of health emergencies, who spoke for him. But Ghebreyesus tweeted shortly after the attack, condemning it and calling for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, as well as for Israel's evacuation order for northern Gaza to be reversed. Al Ahli Arab Hospital was one of 22 hospitals in the north end of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from Israeli forces -- an order the WHO, UN, and other agencies have said is impossible to carry out due to insecurity in the area, the critical condition of many patients, a lack of ambulances, and a lack of alternative shelter, among other factors. Combined, hospitals in northern Gaza were treating more than 2,000 patients, WHO officials said Tuesday. Since the beginning of the war October 7, four Palestinian hospitals have been rendered inoperable due to damage or targeting, they said Wednesday, adding that its Gaza warehouse was now barren. Health workers are having to make impossible choices to ration what little they have left in supplies, the agency said in a Wednesday tweet, adding that health workers are operating without anesthetics. Israeli forces on Friday ordered the evacuation of all people in northern Gaza in 24 hours as they prepared for a large-scale ground offensive. As of Wednesday, that offensive had not yet started. Many speculated it would not occur before Biden's meeting with Netanyah on Wednesday. Egypt's Rafah crossing, the only potential entry point into Gaza, remained closed Wednesday, preventing thousands of pounds of humanitarian aid from entering the war-torn territory.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Biden says the other team was behind the blast, citing data he had been shown by the YOU.

With the water chest high in Midleton's Darling Buds pre-school, a spokesperson for the creche said that adults helped remove children by piggy back after staff and children became trapped inside. Similarly, parents had to wade through waters at the Educate Together National School to collect their children. The main road in Midleton was under 3ft feet of water, while the town itself saw roads both in and out of the area become impassable after the Owenacurra River burst its banks -- requiring assistance from the army and civil defence. Problems were exacerbated shortly after lunch time, when the wind and rain caused two power outages, one on either side of the town. ESB engineers were unable to wade through the floods before three more faults were recorded in the afternoon -- including one near the community hospital in the town. Local Councillor Susan McCarthy described bins, traffic cones, benches and even a skip floating on the street. Its even dangerous wading through it, she said. At one stage a man was seen kayaking down the street to check on people trapped in their businesses and homes. Locals stranded Independent Cllr Liam Quaide told the Irish Examiner that the flooding in Midleton really shows our vulnerability to climate change and the need for adaptation as well as mitigation. I was bringing my daughter home from CUH and I cannot get to (our home) in Broomfield, because both ways are blocked. We are stranded in the Market Green centre where some people we have met have been waiting here for several hours to get home. All rail services between Cork and Cobh and Cork and Midleton were suspended due to water on the line. Cork County Council confirmed that more than 100 properties were flooded in the town. One of those belonged to Himalaya Yoga Studio on Mill Road. Maeve O'Brien from the studio said that they had been hit very hard She explained that due to the floods, they could not reach the studio to fully assess the damage. It is a huge blow for all the businesses in Midleton. Ideally, we would open our doors tomorrow but we are not too hopeful of that. Ms O'Brien said it was absolutely crucial that all stakeholders worked together to get a flood relief system in place to prevent future issues. Councillor Danielle Twomey said the flood was the town's worst in living memory. She was one of the parents of children at Midleton's Educate Together School who had to wade through knee-high water along Mill Road to get to the school. We drove our cars as near to the school as we could and then just waded out to the school, she said. I was there to collect my two daughters and although the school itself was not flooded, the road to it was like a river. The water subsided after a while but when we went to collect our children, we had no idea how bad things would be. We did not want to take any chances. So, you had this scene of parents wading through flood waters with children on their backs. I have never seen anything like it in my life. She said several estates and Midleton hospital were under a metre of water and access to Midleton from Cloyne was cut off. A rest centre was established in the town's community centre to facilitate those who required evacuation. Meanwhile, in Killeagh, the historic Thatch pub and restaurant was under a metre of water after the adjacent River Dissour burst through at about 9.30am. Proprietor Debbie Walsh said the water was unstoppable and had nowhere to go as it swept across the beer garden and into the bar, kitchen, and store room. The pub, which dates from the mid 1600s, was almost destroyed by fire prior to Debbie and husband Brian taking it over seven years ago. The force of the water was actually dangerous, Debbie recalls. The devastation has been extremely distressing and we are exhausted, she added, but we will clean up and carry on. We are likely to be closed over the coming days, she added. Imokily GAA secretary Patrick Mulcahy said the flood was the worst in the area and that many older generations have never seen this before. Youghal's town centre escaped flooding but some estates and walls in the town were severely affected. A section of wall that was being restored and scaffolding collapsed on Lighthouse Hill, while a huge pond was created at Chestnut Drive estate, as fast-flowing torrents ran downhill. Resident Shane Tobin said a wall collapse redirected almost two metres of water from the rear of his house at the last minute. Meanwhile, James O'Connor TD, who surveyed flood damage in Midleton, said questions need to be asked about why there was not a red weather warning. The level of damage to Midleton and surrounding areas as far as Glanmire has been devastating There is a real sense of destruction, he said. Business have been flooded, the Defence Forces are here on the street, the community hospital has been evacuated and I see school children being brought up the main street on the back of trailers. People were not expecting this and it begs the question: why there not a red warning provided last night? Where was the red warning? The amount of water has been biblical. Water is running out under doors on the Main Street. It is just soul destroying. The Main Street is ruined. He said that what is needed now is support for families and businesses hit by the flooding. People are needing support and luckily the Park Hotel has started hosting families.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"More than 100mm of rain fell from last night all the way through to this afternoon.

Ukraine exported 2.83 million tons from October 1-21 a year ago. The ministry gave no explanation for the decrease.

The exported volume included 3.99 million tons of wheat, 3.04 million tons of corn and 654,000 tons of barley. Ukraine has traditionally shipped most of its exports through its deep water Black Sea ports. A deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey allowing such exports collapsed in July when Russia withdrew, saying its demand that sanctions be lifted on its grain and fertiliser exports had not been met. Ukraine's shipping sources said 34 cargo vessels had entered a fledgling Black Sea shipping corridor as Kyiv steps up a push to defy the de-facto Russian blockade. Ukraine can also export limited volumes through small river ports on the Danube and via its western land border with the European Union.

The warning is in place for parts of Scotland from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday. Yellow alerts for rain cover eastern England and the rest of Scotland on Friday. The agency said the storm could cause exceptional rainfall reaching up to 250mm. The red warning states there is danger to life from fast flowing or deep floodwater in Aberdeenshire and Angus, with extensive flooding and road closures expected. Humza Yousaf, Scotland's First Minister, said that travel should be avoided unless absolutely essential. Mass rail closures were announced for eastern Scotland until Friday, with lines from Perth to Aberdeen and to Aviemore not running. Network Rail said trains between Aberdeen and Elgin are also cancelled. Aberdeenshire Council alerted residents to significant supplies of sandbags that it had stockpiled to protect their homes from flooding. The red warning alerts people to the danger of communities becoming cut off for days. The last red warning for rain was in February 2020 when Wales was hit by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest recorded levels and more than 1,400 homes and businesses flooded. At least three people died. On Wednesday trains were suspended in Greater Manchester after a tree was brought down onto overhead power lines. Cornwall and Devon were battered by gale force winds and heavy rain with 45mph gusts in coastal areas of the South. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution warned that the storm poses a safety risk to those visiting the coast and that the public should exercise extreme caution, particularly near cliffs, seafronts and piers. In the Devon town of Paignton, several beach huts were destroyed in the extreme weather as waves battered the seafront. Sean White, of watersports company and community club Soak Lifestyle, in Torquay, said on Facebook: One of our shipping containers, our sports one, ended up in the ocean and the other one has been bashed like a washing machine. We have lost everything, and obviously that is totally devastating and we are lacking words among all the emotion right now. Mr White added that he did not account for the storm surge which made an extra metre or so tide that we had not anticipated. He and his business partner Laura Rickard managed to arrange for cranes to save the container that held their coffee shop by lifting it away from the seafront.

One crewmember was reportedly seriously injured and transferred to a local hospital with burns, but the injuries are being called non-life threatening. The cruise ship, the Ocean Navigator (4,954 gross tons) operated by Hornblower Group's American Queen Voyages, had docked in Portland around 7:00 a.m. arriving from Halifax, Canada at the end of a coastal cruise in Canada. The local fire department said it received reports of smoke coming from the ship at around 7:25 a.m. and dispatched its units. By the time they arrived, the crew was controlling the fire and they assisted in ensuring the fire was out. People working at the terminal told local reporters that they saw smoke and believed they heard an explosion from within the ship. The cruise line and YOU.S. Coast Guard are reporting that it was a generator fire and it was contained to the engine room. There were 128 passengers and 82 crew aboard the ship. The passengers were all evacuated into the terminal and according to city officials have now been moved to a local hotel. None of the passengers were injured. A Coast Guard prevention and response team reported to the site as well as the ATF, Maine State Fire Marshall, Maine State Fire Investigator, Portland Fire Department, and Customs and Border Patrol. At the last report, teams were working to vent the cruise ship while an investigation was also underway. The Ocean Navigator was built in 2001 as a modern version of an American coastal cruise ship and was to have been named Cape Cod Light. Her original owners went bankrupt, and she sat idle for years before a series of different operators managed the ship. She is 286 feet in length with accommodations for 202 passengers. The ship was due to spend tonight in Portland and embark passengers tomorrow for a 10-day cruise to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maine before ending in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on October 27. Passengers for the trip have already arrived in Portland and were due to spend tonight in a hotel before boarding the cruise ship. Based on the company's website, the upcoming cruise was her last scheduled trip. Earlier this year, American Queen Voyages announced they would discontinue the operation of the Ocean Navigator and her sister ship Ocean Voyager focusing instead on the company's river cruises. The sister ship Ocean Voyager is in Halifax today and is due to arrive in Portland on October 20. The YOU.S. Coast Guard reported this afternoon that the Ocean Navigator is currently not permitted to sail as there is an ongoing investigation.

A North Carolina family is demanding answers after their loved one's body was found facedown on the lawn of an empty home where a groundskeeper saw it, mistook it for a prop dummy, and mowed the grass around him. The body of Robert Paul Owens, 34, was found on October 10 at an abandoned log cabin used by several law enforcement agencies for trainings on Shue Road in the small town of China Grove, about 35 miles northeast of Charlotte, the China Grove Police Department said. One day prior, on October 9, a groundskeeper saw the body as he was mowing the property, but believed the body was a fake dummy used for training and as a result did not report it, police said. A construction worker on the property reported the body to police the following day. Haley Shue, Owens sister, told NBC News her family is heartbroken that her brother's body was not reported sooner. The body was exposed for so long they will not be able to have an open casket memorial for him, she said. She remembered her brother as a kind person whoadored his nieces and nephews. The family suspects foul play in his death, she said. Shue said her family last saw Owens on Sunday October 8. That day he spent time with a friend, went to a gas station and got a ride from a friend back to his grandmother's house where he lived. Later, he was picked up by someone to visit another friend, but did not return home. The abandoned home where he was found on the lawn is near his grandmother's home, but it is a property he had never been to before, his sister said. She described the property as off the main road, down a long driveway with woods on either side, and not visible to neighbors. On Tuesday October 10, Shue got a call from her mother saying no one had heard from her brother in two days. Later that same day, the family was notified by police that Owens' body was found, identified by his tattoos. But, Shue said, police refused to tell the family where he was found, the state he was in or how he may have died, simply saying he did not have a gunshot wound. As of right now no family member has laid eyes on him since this occurred, Shue said. She and her family took it upon themselves to find the house where his body was found, where they found a construction worker who reported Owens' body to police. He said he found Owens face down in his underwear and socks with one arm under him, one arm out with marks on his arms that he took as what looked to be defensive marks, Shue said. You can only think what is running through our mind. He does not have any of his clothes, where is his clothes? Where is his belongings? Where is his wallet, his cellphone, shoes and all that? she said. That construction worker told Shue and her family that the groundskeeper saw Owens' body the day before. His words were that the groundskeeper assumed that my brother was Halloween decor or a mannequin and I guess he took it upon himself to assume that and not verify and mowed the entire property, Shue said. It just blows our mind how someone can not stop and verify, this is a strange Halloween decoration, or a strange mannequin or dummy, why would officers leave this behind? she added. The family was further frustrated to find that there was no crime scene tape or signs of preserving the scene. We just feel they should have protected the scene for a little while, Shue said. Preliminary findings from an autopsy conducted Friday ruled out any signs of assault or trauma to the body, police said, noting that a toxicology report is pending to determine because of death. There is definitely some sort of foul play. We have been briefly told by police about some glass around his body. We do not know if that glass is from a car or something else, Shue said. There is no broken glass on the house. Now the family is asking for the public to call in with tips if they saw or heard of anything suspicious in China Grove on October 8 that can help solve what happened to Owens. Someone is involved in this and someone knows of this property and knows that the house is there to have brought him there, Shue said. The family has created an online fundraiser to cover Owens' funeral costs. That is something we have to live with, knowing no family ever identified him. No family got to say any final goodbyes to him. We just want to bring awareness to it, Shue said. We miss him dearly.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The body of Robert Paul Owens, 34, was found on October 10 at an abandoned log cabin used by several law enforcement agencies for trainings.

A 4.2 magnitude earthquake was felt across California's Sacramento County and parts of the Bay Area on Wednesday morning, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The quake hit southern Sacramento at 9:29 a.m, exposing the towns of Rio Vista and Isleton to 'Moderate' shaking. It was initially estimated to be magnitude 5.7, but was downgraded. There was light shaking across 5 nearby towns, including Oakley and Discovery Bay, and weak shaking in Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose, said the USGS. There have been no reports of damage or injury. An emergency alert instructing people to Drop, Cover, and Hold On was sent to mobile phones across the area, reported NBC affiliate KCRA. The San Francisco Bay Area train service BART delayed trains for 5-8 minutes to conduct track inspections. The earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 6.7 miles from the earth's surface, according to the USGS. The intensity of shaking during an earthquake diminishes as the depth increases. That is why the 4.8 magnitude earthquake which hit California at a depth of 19.2 miles on Monday had a lower impact. The earthquake struck just a day before the statewide Great California ShakeOut earthquake drill, where 10.1 million people across the state will practice how to be safer during large earthquakes. According to the California Earthquake Authority, most Californians live within 30 miles of one of the more than 500 active fault lines running across the state.

Former Vice President Mike Pence is having an unusually quiet week on the trail after filing a finance report showing his campaign facing money troubles. The usually busy Pence campaign's only public event this week was a pre-planned Tuesday Newsmax town hall in Windsor Heights, Iowa . Pence is not planning to attend Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks' MMM Tailgate in Iowa City Friday -- where much of the rest of the 2024 GOP presidential field will appear, including former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Instead, the Pence campaign says he will be in Dallas for private fundraisers and a Republican National Committee event. Pence's campaign reported only 1.2 million in the bank after the third quarter -- not all of which can even be spent in the 2024 primary. The campaign is already carrying 620,000 in debt, and Pence himself chipped in 150,000 of his own personal money to keep things going in the third quarter. That puts a serious strain on the day-to-day operations of the campaign -- and what is more, Pence also faces a sprint to amass the 70,000 unique donors needed to qualify for the November 8 GOP presidential debate. His campaign has not yet commented on how close it is to meeting the donor threshold, which was a struggle for Pence in the lead-up to the first GOP debate in August.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Pence's only public event this week was a pre-planned Tuesday Newsmax town hall in Iowa.

Several landmark studies have been published in the last year highlighting the link between chemical hair relaxers -- which break down proteins in hair to straighten it -- and increased rates of uterine cancer. And last week, after pressure from Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Shontel Brown of Ohio, the Food and Drug Administration said it would propose a ban on hair-smoothing and hair-straightening products containing formaldehyde, an ingredient known to cause cancer. As more research continues to reveal potential dangers, hundreds of Black people have filed lawsuits against big-name beauty and cosmetic retailers like L'Oreal and Revlon, blaming their chemical hair straighteners as causes of uterine cancer, fibroid tumors and infertility. The latest research on the effects of hair relaxers was published October 10 by Boston University. According to the Black Women's Health Study, or BWHS, postmenopausal Black women who have used chemical hair relaxers more than twice a year or for more than five years have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. In following 44,798 Black women for up to 22 years, researchers found a higher rate of uterine cancer among postmenopausal Black women who reported having used chemical hair relaxers for at least 10 years, regardless of frequency. Better grasping Black health and the factors that contribute to racial disparities in cancer was the intent behind the 22-year study. The idea here is that a renewed emphasis or attention to the potential dangers of these products, I hope, will spur policies, and that will sort of help reduce exposure in this population or even help us identify potentially safer alternatives to straighten hair, said the lead author of the study, Kimberly Bertrand, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University Chobanian  Avedisian School of Medicine. Revealing the potential risks of hair relaxers, she said, can help spread awareness and encourage making safer choices. NBC News spoke to Bertrand and other researchers to answer some questions Black people may have about chemical hair straighteners and the potential risks to their health Several studies have found that chemical hair straighteners have harmful effects on the body. Last year, the National Institutes of Health published a major study linking chemical hair straighteners to a higher risk of uterine cancer. The study analyzed data from 33,497 YOU.S. women ages 35 to 74 who were followed for nearly 11 years. During that period, 378 cases of uterine cancer were diagnosed. According to this month's BWHS, women who reported using hair relaxers more than twice a year or who used them for more than five years had a greater than 50 risk of developing uterine cancer compared to those who rarely or never used relaxers, additional data from the study shows. In 2021, the BWHS found that Black women who used hair products containing lye, an ingredient typically found in salon relaxers, at least seven times a year for more than 15 years had a 30 increased risk of developing breast cancer. Among the 50,543 women who participated in the 25-year study, 2,311 participants had developed breast cancer, including 1,843 who developed invasive breast cancers, meaning the cancers spread into surrounding breast tissue. While Black women have a 4 lower incidence rate of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a 40 higher breast cancer death rate, according to the American Cancer Society. Other studies have shown that hair relaxers can cause fibroids and an early onset of puberty in girls, Bertrand said. Early puberty can increase the risk for metabolic syndromes such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Chemical hair relaxers contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can disrupt the functions of the endocrine system (which includes the thyroid, ovaries, pancreas and adrenal glands) and affect hormone levels. These chemicals include phthalates and parabens, which can be found in relaxers. People can be exposed to them by absorption through the skin or inhaling them in the air. Black women are often exposed to endocrine disruptors by using relaxers, which are applied on the scalp, said Jasmine Abrams, a research scientist at the Yale University School of Public Health. If you have ever gotten a relaxer, you know it usually sits on for a little bit, and most people sort of alert their hair stylist that it needs to be washed out once it starts tingling or burning -- and at that point, you are running the risk of burns, said Abrams, one of the authors of a study this year linking chemical hair straighteners to issues with fertility. And if you are running the risk of burns or any sort of injury with that type of chemical, then you are definitely increasing your risk for absorption. If you do that over time for many, many years, then it can, of course, become continuously problematic. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can also be found in some beauty products like lotions, body washes and perfumes, she added. Parabens, phthalates and other chemicals that are often found in chemical hair straighteners pose a greater risk than other products because of scalp exposure, Bertrand said. Even other chemical hair straighteners marketed as safer to use, including no-lye relaxers, still pose potential risks. In our study, women who reported using non-lye relaxers were pretty much just as likely to report scalp burns as those who use lye relaxer, she said. Hair-straightening products are very poorly regulated by the federal government, Bertrand said, and many mask harmful chemicals under names such as fragrance and preservatives, so women do not really know what they are being exposed to. YOU.S. law does not require the Food and Drug Administration to approve cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives, before they go on the market, according to the FDA website. However, the FDA announced last week that it would propose a ban on hair-straightening and hair-smoothing products containing formaldehyde. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stricter regulations of ingredients in cosmetic products and using alternative methods like heat straightening may help reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, Bertrand said. Researchers are not entirely sure. We cannot definitively say that occasional use is entirely safe, said Abrams, an author of the 2023 study about hair relaxers and infertility. Our data essentially suggests that less frequent use is associated with lower risks when compared to regular prolonged use. In Abrams' study -- which included women of different races ages 21 to 45 -- Black women accounted for the greatest population of people who had started using relaxers at age 10 or younger. More than 50 of the Black participants in the study also had used hair relaxers before they reached age 10. Bertrand's study found that postmenopausal Black women had a greater risk of developing uterine cancer if they used hair relaxers more than twice a year or consistently for more than five years. Other factors put Black women at risk for developing uterine cancer, including age, obesity and family and reproductive history, Bertrand added. There are no proven screening mechanisms to detect uterine cancer in the general population, as there are with other diseases like breast cancer, Bertrand said. Women should visit their doctors if they have any symptoms of pain in the pelvic area or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Those with family histories of uterine cancer can also speak to their doctors about genetic testing to identify potential higher risks for certain cancers. In terms of monitoring reproductive health, Abrams said, women can monitor their hormone levels -- either by visiting endocrinologists or mailing in their biospecimens to labs -- and speak with gynecologists about their concerns and ask about taking fertility assessments. In working on an upcoming study on Black women and infertility, she said, many of her participants have described challenges in getting treatment or being heard by their health providers. One of our participants said, 'I felt like the goal among providers has always been to figure out how to keep Black women from getting pregnant, not to help them figure out how to get pregnant,' Abrams said. So she felt like, when she expressed these concerns about her fertility to her provider, she was not taken seriously. Many Black women have consulted with attorneys to sue Revlon, Just for Me and other cosmetics companies, alleging their hair straighteners because cancer, fibroids and other health problems. Strength of Nature, LLC, which owns Just for Me, declined to comment. Larry Taylor Jr., an attorney at The Cochran Firm in Dallas, said thousands of women from their 20s to their 50s have filed suits alleging they developed ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers from using hair relaxers. Revlon declined to comment. Robert Britton, an attorney for the company, said earlier this year that Revlon disputes any link between cancer and its hair relaxer products. Thousands of Black women have also claimed that hair relaxers from L'Oreal were harmful to their health, including a group of Black women who sued L'Oreal and other companies last year. One woman, Bernadette Gordon, who used hair relaxers from 1983 to 2015, experienced uterine and breast cancer resulting in a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy, she previously told NBC News. In July, L'Oreal asked a federal court to dismiss the dozens of consolidated lawsuits against the company, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims were vague and based on unsupported conclusions. The company did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Many Black women straighten their hair to keep their jobs or advance to higher positions, which puts them at risk, Taylor said. This is not a hoax, he said. This is something that is actually harmful and could potentially cost them their lives. Still, there are many unknowns researchers are trying to uncover, including whether the products on the shelves today are going to lead to cases of uterine cancer in the future, Bertrand said. It is also not entirely clear why Black women are at an increased risk of developing and dying from uterine cancer. We continue to explore those factors -- everything from environment to racism to genetics, she said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Several studies have found a link between hair relaxers and increased rates of uterine cancer.

The Met Office has taken the step of issuing a rare 'red weather warning' amid concerns that the storm could cause severe damage, possibly even posing a danger to life. Laurencekirk, Montrose and Forfar are among the towns covered by the alert, which comes into effect at 6pm tomorrow and is due to last until 12pm on Friday - with the communities being warned of possible collapsing buildings, road closures, loss of power and extensive flooding. It is the first time a red warning has been issued for rain since Storm Dennis pounded the country in 2020. But just what does a red weather warning mean? A red weather warning is the highest possible alert which can be issued by the Met Office. According to their website it means that 'dangerous weather is expected and, if you have not already done so, you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the severe weather. The Met Office adds: 'It is very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. 'You should avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.' Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly said of Storm Babet: 'Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the red warning. '100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts with flooding likely.' Other parts of the country are facing amber and yellow weather warnings in the wake of the storm. The Met Office describes an amber warning as 'an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans. 'This means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property. You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. 'You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact. Yellow weather warnings are issued when the weather is likely to have a more low-level effect. Many are issued when it is likely that the weather will cause some low level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places,' the Met Office says. 'Many people may be able to continue with their daily routine, but there will be some that will be directly impacted and so it is important to assess if you could be affected. As these are used for a range of weather scenarios, the advice is to 'read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning'. While it is the first red warning issued for rain for some time, there have been a number of red warnings given for other extreme weather events in recent years. A red warning was issued for the South-east and east of England, and south Wales in February 2022 in the wake of Storm Eunice, which brought with it winds of up to 122mph, while 2021's Storm Arwen also led to a red weather warning for wind - covering a large section of the east coast from Aberdeen to Newcastle. However, the most recent red warning was for heat - and it marked the first time the Met Office had issued such an alert for high temperatures. That one, issued in July 2022, covered most of central and Southern England, when the hottest part of the UK reached above 40C for the first time ever.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Met Office has issued a rare 'red weather warning' for parts of Scotland.

In that April report, BNSF analyzed a section of fractured rail following March 2023's fiery derailment that forced evacuations in southwest Minnesota. . . however they have not officially concluded that the broken rail caused the crash. On April 18, the NTSB released a preliminary report on the Minnesota derailment and stated that a train carrying 14 hazardous materials tank cars was traveling north, and at 12:58 a.m. local time, 10 tank cars derailed, hazardous materials were released and contributed to a fire.

Ukraine had repeatedly asked the US administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Mr Zelensky's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 310km. The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told national television. Kyiv's Western partners have been careful about supplying long-range missiles needed for its four-month-old counteroffensive, fearing it would provoke the Kremlin.

The hearing, hosted by the Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee, comes at a critical time in the wake of Hamas' terrorist attack in Israel. President Joe Biden is in the region this week for meetings with Israeli leaders, and Israel is preparing for a potential ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week that the administration is working to get Lew confirmed quickly. Biden nominated him last month. We are going to work with both Democrats and Republicans -- and particularly the leaders on both sides and the chair and ranking member in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- to make that happen as soon as humanly possible and then get him out to the region immediately thereafter, Sullivan said. After the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, the White House began working urgently to kick-start the confirmation process. Congressional recesses and other issues had delayed it. The YOU.S. has not had a Senate-confirmed ambassador to Israel since Thomas Nides left the administration in July. Stephanie Hallett, a career diplomat, has been the top YOU.S. official at the YOU.S. Embassy in the interim. Lew, who is Jewish, has decades of experience in Washington, and he has been active in pro-Israel advocacy circles. He was the White House chief of staff for the last two years of President Barack Obama's first term and then was treasury secretary from 2013 to 2017. His current positions include managing partner at Lindsay Goldberg LLC, visiting professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and co-president of the board of the National Library of Israel USA. Lew, 68, was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Obama and President Bill Clinton. During the Clinton administration, he helped develop the memorandum of understanding on multiyear YOU.S. funding for Israel, and during the Obama administration he worked several times to provide crucial funding for Israel's missile defense systems that are designed to protect residents from attacks, a White House official said recently. At the beginning of his career, Lew was a congressional aide, at one point serving as a senior policy adviser to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last month immediately endorsed Lew after Biden nominated him. It is vital we have a strong American ambassador in Jerusalem. Mr. Lew is precisely the person for the job of ambassador to Israel that we need, Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. Lew is likely to get widespread support from Senate Democrats, but it is unclear how many Republicans he can win over. And while he may not need GOP backing if all 51 members of the Democratic Caucus back him, unanimous bipartisan support would allow for a faster confirmation vote. The Senate could confirm Lew as soon as next week. Even in the face of Republican opposition, Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., hopes Democrats can get cooperation to move quickly on the Senate floor. It is critically important to have a confirmed ambassador, Cardin told NBC News. We are talking about being with Israel, giving them everything they need. Well, we need to have a confirmed ambassador on the ground in Israel to evaluate exactly what they need and be able to get that aid or weapons to Israel. Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel, told reporters he expects there to be some GOP opposition to Lew. I am going to listen with an open mind, Risch said. But I have to tell you, given the things that have happened in the past with him, it is going to be a heavy lift for me. But he is going to have an opportunity Wednesday to persuade people that he is the right guy for the job. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is not a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told NBC News: We should not confirm someone who has been so soft on Iran, repeatedly. ... The Democrats may say it is a way to show our support for Israel. On the contrary, we should show that we have a new approach to Iran by defeating Jack Lew's nomination. During the confirmation hearing, Republicans are expected to focus on an interaction Lew had before the Foreign Relations Committee when he was treasury secretary in 2015, when he said Iran will continue to be denied access to the YOU.S. financial and commercial market. In 2016, the Treasury Department issued a license granting Iran access to YOU.S. financial systems, but American banks eventually declined, fearing legal and compliance risks. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., another Foreign Relations Committee member, said in an interview on Fox Business Network that he has real concerns that Lew has misled and lied to Congress in the past in terms of the some of the financial arrangements that were made under the Obama administration. Rubio, however, said he thinks the YOU.S. should have an ambassador in every country, and he stopped short of expressing opposition to Lew's nomination. Lew has faced opposition from other Senate Republicans.

The consequences are felt today as Iran -- flush w cash due to Biden's push to revive the deal at any cost -- has fueled carnage in Israel, he tweeted. Lew must answer for the failed Obama-Biden Middle East strategy as he appears before the Senate Foreign Relations committee for his confirmation hearing. In 2015, the YOU.S. and other countries entered a nuclear deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which eased sanctions on Iran in return for strict limits on its nuclear program designed to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions while introducing new ones. Republicans criticized Lew in 2016 when, as part of a settlement between the YOU.S. and Iran, he defended a 1.7 billion cash payment to Iran's government. Lew is also likely to be asked about the debate over whether to provide Iran access to 6 billion as part of a prisoner swap deal with the YOU.S. last month.

But who would govern Gaza after that?,"Biden administration officials and lawmakers support Israel's plans to strike hard at Hamas but they worry their ally has no clear plan for who will govern Gaza if and when the militants are driven out, according to sources familiar with the matter, members of Congress and former YOU.S. officials. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, an organization that has been entrenched in Gaza for decades and in power since 2006, but the Israeli government has yet to outline what it envisions for the densely populated enclave after the military operation ends. Israel does not appear to have a plan or strategy for what will follow its military offensive, said Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. That is obviously a big problem, as we learned in both Iraq and Afghanistan, said Moulton, who served in Iraq as a Marine. You have to have a plan for the day after and fundamentally it has to be a political plan, he said. Even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken holds marathon crisis talks this week with Israel and other regional governments to avoid a humanitarian calamity in Gaza, Blinken and other officials are also exploring what will come next for Gaza if Hamas is no longer in charge. Whenever we are coming out of this we need a future for the Palestinians that is viable. One lesson of this whole thing is, that is going to be a necessity, Derek Chollet, counselor to the secretary of state, told NBC News. Chollet said Blinken raised the issue of how Gaza will be governed in talks on Tuesday with Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories. Part of the conversation Blinken is having today with President Abbas is what is the future of Gaza without Hamas and what does that mean for the Palestinian Authority and their role? Chollet said Tuesday. On Capitol Hill, preliminary discussions have begun about Gaza's political future, congressional aides said. The Biden administration has vowed unwavering support for Israel after it suffered a surprise attack from Hamas over its southern border on October 7 that left 1,400 dead, mostly civilians, and an estimated 200 captive. But officials also worry about the effects of a massive Israeli bombardment and an expected ground offensive into Gaza on Palestinian civilians, and how a rising civilian death toll could blow up any international effort to rebuild Gaza without Hamas in control. Asked about what will come next in Gaza if Hamas is rooted out, an Israeli official said: At this point, Israel is focused on establishing a humanitarian zone for civilians in Gaza and on destroying Hamas' military capabilities. Other Israeli officials contacted by NBC News declined to comment on the record or did not respond. Israel remains in a state of shock from the Hamas assault, which shattered the country's sense of security, and is preoccupied with the immediate task of striking at their adversaries, former YOU.S. officials said. There is an imperative for Israel to kill the leadership, to destroy the stockpiles of weapons, munitions, explosives, to destroy as much of the military infrastructure as possible, said John Brennan, the former director of the CIA who served in the Middle East during his career at the agency. But the day after, it is hard to envision. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday that the administration was trying to examine how Gaza would be governed in the future. These are important long-term questions to begin asking and grappling with today. We believe that Israel is grappling with them, we are talking to them about them, Sullivan told CBS' Face the Nation. I am not going to share the details of those private conversations. But what I will say is, right now, the focus of the Israeli operation is on that terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. Biden has said that it would be a big mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again. The president said he believed Hamas should be eliminated entirely but there ... needs to be a path to a Palestinian state, he told CBS' 60 Minutes in an interview that aired on Sunday. Given the deep uncertainty about how the Israeli military offensive against Hamas unfolds and how the region reacts, it is almost impossible to draft a plan for Gaza at the moment, some former officials and experts said. The elements of any plan for Gaza would likely involve a transition period under YOU.N. or international authority; an important role for the Palestinian Authority; removing Hamas' weapons arsenal under the supervision of a third party; strong support from Egypt; elections; major international funding especially from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states for the rebuilding of Gaza; and a new peace process designed to forge a two-state solution, said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former senior State Department official who focused on Middle East policy. Such a scenario would mean the sun, the moon and the stars aligning over a period of months and years, Miller said. Talking about a new political future for Gaza is like talking about a galaxy far, far away given the unpredictable factors at work and the daunting political obstacles, he said. Jason Greenblatt, former White House special envoy to the Middle East in the Trump administration, said that the goal should be that once the terrorists are gone, to rebuild Gaza and once and for all try to implement plans that many well-meaning nations have already tried: rebuild Gaza and make it look like it deserves to look. It is a seaside city, he added. It could be incredible. David Friedman, who was YOU.S. ambassador to Israel during the Trump administration, said the endgame for Gaza would be if representatives of the Arab League were willing to step up and kind of pursue some sort of a trusteeship for Gaza for some finite period of time, in a manner that appeals to the Gazans themselves to form institutions for self-governance. For Palestinians, the immediate threat posed by Israel's air raids on Gaza and its order for more than a million civilians to leave northern Gaza make it impossible to contemplate any future political arrangements, much less consider proposals from governments that they believe have abandoned them, said Yousef Munayyer, senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, a think tank. The first and most urgent step needed now is a ceasefire, followed by diplomacy, Munayyer said. The assumptions behind Israeli military action in Gaza were flawed and merely repeating past failures, he said. After Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the Israelis calculated that the costs of maintaining a physical military presence on the ground were too high. So, we have been through this before, Munayyer said. He said that there is no vision for the day after, because it does not exist. Hamas emerged in a power vacuum in Gaza, and militancy would continue to spread as long as the underlying political issues were left unaddressed, he said. The YOU.S. approach in recent years has been to focus on reconciliation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, an idea launched under the Trump administration, as a way of setting the conditions for an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Munayyer said that has proved to be a grave mistake. What we are seeing today, on the ground, is the price that we are paying for ignoring the urgency of dealing with this issue, he said. And there was a great degree of hubris on the part of American policymakers who thought that that was OK. That the YOU.S. could go on with our objectives in the Middle East and elsewhere around the world, without really paying attention to this issue. Despite the current crisis, the Biden administration remains committed to salvaging negotiations for a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an idea that Hamas and its Iranian patrons strongly oppose. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he has spoken at length to Secretary of State Blinken about what could come next for Gaza. We talked about that a lot, said the senator, who was part of a congressional delegation due to visit the region. The Israelis believe that destroying Hamas makes a deal with the Palestinians and peace more likely, not less likely, Graham said in an interview. You have a radicalized population and you have to deal with that. But the conditions for change become better when Hamas goes away, he said. And I do believe that Israel understands there is no normalization with Saudi Arabia without something significant for the Palestinians. Graham said there would need to be a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs the West Bank but was pushed out of Gaza by Hamas, but it would have to be reformed. The PA is the only game in town. But they need to be reformed. Giving a bunch of money to the same old people is probably a waste. It is time for a new generation of Palestinian leadership, he said. But he added that that scenario is a work in progress and it depends on how these military operations end. Since withdrawing from Gaza in 2005, Israel has launched several military operations in the enclave against Hamas, mostly recently in 2021. But Israel will have to re-examine its past assumptions to break the cycle of conflict, said Gershon Baskin, the Middle East director for International Communities Organization, a YOU.K.-based group dedicated to protecting human rights and building peace. If there is a chance of a new tomorrow, with a Gaza that might be able to live in peace with Israel, it has to be a Gaza which is open and developed, where people have work and a chance at a better life, and a future. And it has to be based on the ground rules that Israel can no longer occupy the Palestinian people and expect to live in peace, said Baskin, who helped negotiate the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011 after he was held by Hamas for five years. We have been living with a conceptual delusion that we can have it all and have peace. We cannot lock 2.5 million people in a cage in Gaza and expect for them not to rebel against us.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Biden administration officials and lawmakers support Israel's plans to strike hard at Hamas.

Exploiting the Palestinian issue has long been a strategic ploy of the Iranian regime. Over the years, Iran's approach has consistently been to sow division and spread Islamic fundamentalism among the Palestinian people, effectively undermining the mainstream Palestinian leadership that is committed to peace and a two-state solution. Hamas was founded in Gaza in 1987. It was an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose candidate Mohamed Morsi won the June 2012 Egyptian presidential elections, but was overthrown within a year after mass protests. Morsi and most of the Brotherhood's leadership were imprisoned in Egypt and the organization was designated as a terrorist group and its assets were seized. Inspired by the Brotherhood, Hamas published a charter in 1988 defining itself as an Islamic national liberation and resistance movement with a policy of establishing an Islamic State in Palestine. Hamas differs from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in that it rejects negotiations with Israel and advocates armed resistance. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2006, defeating its rival Fatah in elections, and has maintained this position ever since. The relationship between Iran and Hamas began in the early 1990s, a few years after Hamas was founded. Iran sees support for Hamas as a means of challenging Israel and extending its influence in the region. Over time, Iran has provided significant financial support to Hamas, particularly after it took power in Gaza in 2006. Iran's aid enabled Hamas to develop its own weapons, with Khaled Mashal, the former head of its political bureau, describing Hamas as the spiritual son of (Ayatollah) Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.When Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006, the Iranian regime increased its support, providing funding, rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles, as well as training and technical assistance through its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) elite Quds Force, responsible for foreign operations. Iran's support for Hamas has continued to strengthen, particularly in the period from 2015 to 2018, which was characterized by the growing threat from Israel and Hamas's increased reliance on Iranian sponsorship. The potency of the relationship was further evidenced by Iran's increased presence in Gaza through proxies such as Islamic Jihad. Some of the fighters involved in the recent terrorist assault on Israel led by Hamas militants belonged to Islamic Jihad, the second-most powerful Palestinian militant group operating in the Gaza Strip with backing from Iran. Like Hamas, Islamic Jihad is also designated as a terrorist group, blacklisted by the UK, EU and US. The closeness of the relationship was amplified in August 2021, when the Hamas leader - Ismail Haniyeh and his team, were invited to attend the inauguration of President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran. Raisi, dubbed 'The Butcher of Tehran' for his notorious role as an executioner during the 1988 massacre of more than 30,000 political prisoners, ensured that the Hamas delegation was met at the airport and seated in the front row during the ceremony. During a series of high-level meetings following the inauguration, Hamas confirmed its unwavering support for the 'axis of resistance' against Israel and for the Iranian regime's proxy wars in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Since then, there has been an increasing flow of rockets, anti-tank missiles and other sophisticated weaponry, smuggled into Gaza through tunnels from Egypt, some of which are large enough to be fitted with rail tracks, and from ships docking in Gaza's ports. Iran has also provided huge financial support to Hamas, both directly and indirectly. Direct funding includes cash payments to Hamas' operatives and officials, as well as specific operations. Indirect funding includes the provision of goods and services, such as medical supplies and construction materials, which Hamas can sell or trade for income. The funding has increased to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Last year, the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, told Al-Jazeera TV that Iran had funded its deterrent forces against Israel and had helped to build attack tunnels to be used to surprise the Israelis. But it must be remembered that the Iranian people do not support the regime's massive spending on proxy wars and militias like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, across the Middle East. With a collapsing economy and widespread poverty, the recent nationwide uprising in Iran has been marked by protesters chanting slogans decrying financial aid to groups like Hamas, highlighting the deep gulf between the mullahs' regime and the public it is supposed to serve. Hamas militants share a philosophy of hatred. They are misogynists. They hate the Jews. They hate Christians. They hate atheists. They hate alcohol, music and Western freedoms. These pet hates manifested themselves in a frenzy of brutality and murder, when they attacked young party goers attending the Supernova music festival at the Re'i am Kibbutz, just three miles from the border with Gaza. The all-night, alcohol-fueled party would have represented the embodiment of all of the militants' warped prejudices, unleashing a bloodbath of mass slaughter and butchery. As the crisis unfolds and retaliation by the Israeli military escalates, killing hundreds of Palestinian militants and civilians, there is only one winner likely to emerge from the conflict....Iran. Already Saudi Arabia, a signatory to the Abraham Accords that sought rapprochement with Israel, has put the plans to normalize relations with Tel Aviv on ice. This will be seen as a great victory in Tehran. Pulverising Gaza will only create a new generation of Hamas terrorists. As Naftali Bennett, the former prime minister of Israel once said, there is no use in struggling against the tentacles of the Iranian regime that encircle Israel. Better to strike at the head of the octopus in Tehran. Seventy five million Iranians want rid of the mullahs' regime. We should support them.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Iran's backing for Hamas and their deadly terrorist attack on Israel has deep roots.

That would never be the way that we would operate. Both CEOs were questioned by MPs at a special session of the committee about the bank holiday Monday systems failure. The main and back-up computer systems that normally assist air-traffic controllers failed around 8.30am on the morning of 28 August 2023. The because was later found to be a rogue flight plan for a French aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Paris, which contained duplicate waypoints. Nats engineers solved the previously unknown problem about eight hours later. For much of that time, air-traffic controllers were obliged to revert to manual handling - reducing the capacity of UK airspace by 85 per cent. The failures led to more than 2,000 flight cancellations, affecting over 300,000 passengers. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, condemned the delay between the initial failure and when carriers were alerted shortly after 11am. He said that with more notice, airlines could have put emergency procedures in place much earlier. There was a three-hour window wasted, he said. Mr O'Leary described the Nats boss as vastly overpaid and incompetent and said Mr Rolfe should resign or be sacked after the incident. Like most airlines we did not find out from Nats, we found out from Eurocontrol shortly after 11am, he said. The numpties at Nats did not tell us. We had to find out from someone else that they would crashed their system. Nats said the standard procedure was for Eurocontrol, which oversees air-traffic control across Europe, to communicate with airlines. Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer of easyJet, said: The first time we heard from Nats was a letter the following day. In total, her airline had cancelled around 600 flights. That is thought to have affected more than 100,000 passengers. She said 30,000 passengers had been re-routed by another carrier or on other forms of transport. Eurostar laid on extra trains between Paris and London in the days following the air-traffic control shutdown to help UK-bound passengers, with airlines footing the bill for rail tickets. Both Ryanair and easyJet are thought to have incurred around 15m each in costs for hotels, meals and re-routing passengers. Jonathan Hinkles, chief executive of Loganair, said airlines were insurers of last resort because of the current regime of passengers' rights. If you buy a new washing machine, you have the choice to buy extended warranty, he said. If you are insuring a car, you can choose between fully comprehensive. Every single air ticket that is sold comes with an extended warranty and fully comprehensive insurance. Martin Rolfe, chief executive of Nats, was questioned immediately afterwards by MPs. He told the committee: I absolutely understand the frustration of the airlines. The shutdown was triggered, he said, despite development work trying to predict as many obscure circumstances as you can. Within 20 seconds of the main system shutting down, the back-up did the same. The back-up system had taken over on four occasions over the last five years without an issue, Mr Rolfe said. He added: In the event of something happening that is inexplicable, it is handed on to humans. We have put in a number of fixes to ensure it cannot happen again. While charges at Nats had increased due to dwindling traffic during Covid, Alistair Borthwick - chief financial officer at Nats - said that since 2002 costs have reduced by 38 per cent in real terms. Nats is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The authority's chief executive, Rob Bishton, described the Nats system failure as a rare and very improbable event that had had huge impacts with people who were travelling. He said Nats had been fined 420,000 in 2016 and 240,000 in 2018 for shortcomings in the service provided, but said the effect of penalties could be to push up air-traffic control charges for airlines, and ultimately passengers. Mr Bishton also complimented both sides in the row. He said: The airlines' response during the incident was in many cases above and beyond what we would expect as a regulator. Later, he added: I believe Nats has been very open and transparent.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Main and back-up computer systems that normally assist air-traffic controllers failed around 8.30am on the morning of 28 August 2023.

Their appearance together came as President Joe Biden arrived in Tel Aviv in a show of support for Israel following a devastating and coordinated terrorist attack by Hamas militants on kibbutzim, music festivals and city streets on October 7, and ahead of an expected Israeli ground assault in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave that Hamas controls. Biden said he was outraged by the blast at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday that is estimated to have killed hundreds of people and for which Israel and Hamas have blamed each other. The blast has set off protests across the Middle East and threatens to derail diplomatic efforts by the YOU.S. and others to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which as of Wednesday had killed more than 3,400 people in Gaza and 1,400 people in Israel. Putin called the hospital blast a terrible event and a disaster. I really hope that this will be a signal that this conflict should be ended as quickly as possible, he said at a news conference. In any case, it is necessary to work towards a possibility of starting some contacts and negotiations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Beijing was shocked by and strongly condemns the hospital explosion, expressing condolences to the victims and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians. Putin also said he was optimistic about the future of the China-Russia relationship and that conflicts like his war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war only made it stronger. All these external factors are common threats, and they strengthen Russian-Chinese cooperation, he said. Representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries, including heads of state, gathered at the imposing Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square for a two-day forum marking the 10th anniversary of Xi's signature Belt and Road initiative. Under the program, China has financed major infrastructure projects around the world in an effort to strengthen relations with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, though in some cases they have been criticized as saddling low-income countries with excessive debt. In a speech at the opening ceremony on Wednesday, Xi said the Belt and Road initiative had established a new framework for international cooperation. He also warned against efforts by the YOU.S. and other countries to reduce their dependence on China, the world's second-largest economy, by decoupling. Beijing has objected to measures it sees as aimed at containing its rise such as YOU.S. export controls on semiconductor chips, which the Commerce Department said on Tuesday it was expanding for national security reasons. Viewing others' development as a threat or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one's own life better or speed up one's development, Xi said, as Putin looked on from the front row. Speaking after Xi, Putin praised the Belt and Road initiative as truly a global plan that is aimed at creating more equitable, multipolar world relations. Most Western European countries and other YOU.S. allies kept their representation at the Belt and Road forum to a minimum, including Italy, which looks set to formally withdraw from the initiative. The Italian ambassador to China was one of several European officials who walked out while Putin was speaking in protest of the Ukraine war. China's ties with the West have been strained by its economic and political support for Russia in that war, which Beijing refrains from calling an invasion. During a meeting with Putin on Wednesday that lasted about three hours, Xi said that China supports Russia in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, according to a readout published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry that did not mention Ukraine. The war between Israel and Hamas has only deepened Western disagreement with China and Russia, both of which have avoided condemning Hamas and say the fundamental solution to the conflict is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. In remarks before their meeting on Wednesday, Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of their countries' strong relationship. Both countries have deepened our mutual political trust and maintained strategic coordination in a close and effective manner, Xi said, noting that trade between the two countries reached a record 190 billion last year. In the current difficult conditions, close foreign policy coordination is especially necessary, Putin told Xi. The two longtime leaders, who declared a no limits partnership between their countries last year at a meeting in Beijing weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have met more than 40 times in the last 10 years and frequently mention their friendship. Putin's trip to China is his first outside the former Soviet Union since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him in March that accused him of illegally sending children to Russia from Ukraine. Vietnamese state media reported Tuesday that during the forum Putin also accepted an invitation from Vietnam's president to visit Hanoi soon. While in Beijing, Putin also met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the only European Union government leader to attend the forum, in one of the few meetings Putin has had with any European leader since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,Russian President Vladimir Putin praised his dear friend Xi Jinping. The two leaders spoke at an international conference in Beijing. Their appearance together came as President Joe Biden arrived in Tel Aviv. Biden said he was outraged by the blast at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday that is estimated to have killed hundreds of people and for which Israel and Hamas have blamed each other. The blast has set off protests across the Middle East and threatens to derail diplomatic efforts by the YOUS. and others to end the conflict.

The lead defense lawyer for convicted Fugees hip hop star Prakazrel Pras Michel improperly relied on an experimental generative AI program to draft his closing argument in Michel's high-profile criminal trial last spring, according to a newly-filed brief demanding a retrial for Michel. Michel's new counsel from ArentFox Schiff said that the AI-generated closing argument by Michel's previous lawyer, David Kenner, was a resounding flop: Kenner's closing argument made frivolous arguments, misapprehended the required elements, conflated the schemes and ignored critical weaknesses in the government's case, the brief said. By using an experimental AI program to generate his closing argument, the brief said, Kenner botched the single most important portion of Michel's jury trial. Kenner did not immediately respond to two email queries on the new brief. His co-counsel Alon Israely did not immediately respond to a query sent via LinkedIn. Michel was convicted in April on federal charges of conspiring with fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low in three alleged lobbying schemes to influence two different YOU.S. presidential administrations. His new lawyers contend Kenner's defense of Michel was woefully inadequate, in part because he relied on the AI program EyeLevel.AI to craft his final argument in the complex, politically charged case, which featured testimony from Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio and former YOU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The AI program failed Kenner, and Kenner failed Michel, the brief said. The closing argument was deficient, unhelpful and a missed opportunity that prejudiced the defense. What is even more egregious, according to the ArentFox brief, is that Kenner and Israely appear to have had an undisclosed financial interest in a company called CaseFile Connect, which acted as a technology partner to EyeLevel.AI. The brief asserts that Kenner and Israely regarded Michel's trial as an opportunity to tout CaseFile Connect, advancing their own financial interests at Michel's expense. CaseFile Connect did not immediately respond to queries sent through its website. In a declaration accompanying the brief, ArentFox partner Peter Zeidenberg, a former Justice Department political corruption prosecutor, said his team first learned that Kenner had used an AI program to write his closing argument from Michel's former publicist, who told ArentFox that Kenner said as much at the end of Michel's trial. ArentFox subsequently found a little-noticed May 10 press release issued by EyeLevel.AI after Michel's trial, hailing the first use of generative AI in a federal trial. The press release included a quote from Kenner, who said that the AI program turned hours or days of legal work into seconds, and called his use of the program a look into the future of how cases will be conducted. Zeidenberg's declaration also cited a LinkedIn post by an EyeLevel.AI executive who confirmed the program's use at Michel's trial. AI startup I have been working on is now the first use of AI in a federal criminal trial, the executive wrote in the post. Defense lawyers for Fugees star Pras Michel used our platform to rapidly research and help draft closing arguments. EyeLevel.AI said in an emailed statement that Kenner and Israely do not have a financial stake in its program. EyeLevel's AI for legal is a powerful tool for human lawyers to make human decisions, but do so faster and with far greater information at their fingertips, the company said in response to ArentFox's criticism of its closing argument. EyeLevel is able to ingest and understand complex legal transcripts based solely on the facts of the case as presented in court. ArentFox said it had determined that CaseFile Connect and Kenner's law firm both listed the same office suite in Encino, California, as their primary address. CaseFile Connect's alternative address, according to Zeidenberg's declaration, was a New York City office associated with Kenner co-counsel Israely. CaseFile's website did not disclose its owners, ArentFox said, but the overlap in addresses, Zeidenberg said in his declaration, appears to confirm that Mr. Kenner and Mr. Israely had a financial interest in the AI program Mr. Kenner used to write the closing argument and then boasted about after trial. The ArentFox lawyer said in the filing that his team had contacted Kenner and Israely through their counsel but they declined to speak with Michel's new lawyers about the trial. The motion seeking a retrial for Michel also argued that the proceeding was tainted because the trial judge, YOU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Washington, D.C., allowed jurors to hear that she and another federal judge had already concluded, in the context of the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege, that Michel conspired with an alleged co-conspirator to commit some of the crimes the government charged. Those references, along with allegedly improper testimony about Michel's guilt from the lead case agent on his case, turned the jury into a rubber stamp, the brief argued. The brief listed a litany of purported failures by Kenner, in addition to the alleged AI closing argument fiasco. Among the most serious is ArentFox's accusation that Kenner, who is not an expert in complex white-collar cases or lobbying regulations, outsourced trial preparation to inexperienced contract attorneys at an e-discovery company co-founded by Israely, an old friend. That inadequate preparation was fatal to Kenner's attempts to cross-examine government witnesses, the brief said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Prakazrel Pras Michel's new counsel from ArentFox Schiff said that the AI-generated closing argument by Michel's previous lawyer, David Kenner, was a resounding flop.

Mark Drakeford told MPs belonging to the Welsh Affairs Committee that the petition will be responded to in the usual way that Senedd petitions are considered. But he said that would not happen until at least next March, because the organiser of the petition has not agreed to close the petition early. That means it will remain open for the full six month period. The First Minister was asked by the committee chair, the Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, if he recognised concerns about 20mph zones that he said had been expressed by some of the emergency services. In response, Mark Drakeford said that There are some individual voices in some services that have expressed concern. The services themselves have not and of course we work very closely with them. The rules are no different in a 20 mile an hour road than they are in a 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 mile road. Emergency services are able to travel above the speed limit where there is a case for them to do so. None of that has changed. And I think a number of these concerns are concerns in advance of the facts, when it comes to operating the system on the ground, I do not think that those fears will materialise. Mark Drakeford also told MPs that he does not believe a single penny will be spent on electrifying the main railway line across the north of Wales by the UK Government. In his recent speech to the Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister announced that the northern part of the HS2 rail project would be cancelled and the money saved would be spent on other projects. That included a pledge to spend 1bn on electrification of the North Wales main line. The First Minister was asked by Conservative MP Robin Millar why the Welsh Government had responded to that announcement by saying that electrification was not a priority for Wales. Mark Drakeford said: First of all, the so-called promise unravelled very quickly indeed, when the Secretary of State for Transport in the UK Government said that this was merely an illustrative list, but nobody was to take it as meaning that this was actual money for actual activity. So you know, I do not think a single penny will be spent on this scheme during the lifetime of the current government. As for the issue about whether or not it is a priority the First Minister said that what our Minister pointed to was the joint committee, a committee made up of representatives of the Welsh Government and the UK Government prioritising plans for rail investment in north Wales, but that committee with UK representatives on it had not put electrification of the main line at the top of the list for investment. The announcement was made with no reference to the group that had been established between two governments to draw up priority plans. I am afraid there is very little confidence amongst people in North Wales that this will ever happen because they saw the experience in South Wales which was promised twice that there will be electrification of the mainline and twice that ban was reversed.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Mark Drakeford told MPs that the petition will be responded to in the usual way that Senedd petitions are considered.

Iran is calling for an oil embargo on Israel over the latest deadly air strikes on the Gaza Strip amid growing tensions in the Middle East just as YOU.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Israel. Iran wants an immediate and complete embargo on the Zionist regime by Islamic countries, an oil embargo against the regime, according to a statement from the foreign ministry on Telegram quoted by Bloomberg. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has also called for Muslim countries to expel their respective Israeli ambassadors if they have diplomatic relations with Israel. Amirabdollahian warned, If the war crimes do not stop and the ongoing genocide by the apartheid Zionist regime in Gaza continues, the situation in the region will spiral out of control. Amirabdollahian met with his Kuwaiti counterpart on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)'s Executive Committee in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The emergency meeting is taking place hours after a missile strike on a hospital in Gaza killed about 500 people, with Israel's army and Hamas blaming each other for the attack, which sent oil prices jumping by more than 2 early on Wednesday. Meanwhile, YOU.S. President Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday to discuss the conflict. Following the bombing of the hospital, a meeting of Arab leaders and Biden in Jordan was canceled. Biden claimed that, from what he has seen, the explosion at the hospital was not carried out by Israel but by the other team. Israel is a small oil importer, but the further escalation of the Hamas-Israel war into the wider Middle East is not being ruled out, and analysts are increasingly concerned about supply from the world's most important oil-exporting region.

The 2024 presidential campaign has been all about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war for the last week, putting foreign policy at the center of every candidate speech and event. That was already the case for former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and she has been vocal at every rally that she stands firmly with Israel since Hamas' attack on October 7. We need to be a friend to Israel. We need to be there every step of the way, Haley stated at a town hall in Rochester, New Hampshire, last week. She added, Do not ever be so arrogant to think that we do not need friends. America always needs friends. Having served at the UN for two years during the Trump administration, and her campaign has intentionally leaned into her foreign policy experience since she jumped into the presidential race. Haley often talks about providing weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia and directly confronting China, since she views China as the United States' biggest foreign adversary. But her foreign policy focus on the trail has renewed in the aftermath of Hamas' attack. In America, we always have to have a leader who has moral clarity, Haley said, who can see the difference between good and evil. That has resonated with some voters who have been drawn to her events by her foreign policy experience, with multiple foreign conflicts that affect the YOU.S. raging. Her international experience, two years as the UN Ambassador -- I think that really does help with the situation where we need all the experience we can get right now. We live in very dangerous times, said voter Randy Oliver from Durham, New Hampshire. Tom Boyer, an independent who plans to vote in New Hampshire's Republican primary, stated Haley's position on strong national defense as it pertains to Ukraine and Israel as one of the factors that drew him to her candidacy. Yes, I think her experience in the UN is very important, Boyer said, adding that he hopes other voters jump on the Haley bandwagon. Sharyn Stewart, an undecided New Hampshire voter, has also taken notice of Haley's time at the UN. Other candidates have good experiences in all regions, but she has an international experience. She is dealt with these people in leadership and the General Assembly, Stewart said. It is not just the Israeli-Hamas war that is drawing some voters to Haley's events. Mathilde Diaz, who grew up in Taiwan, stated before a town hall event she was looking to hear the former UN Ambassador's position on China and Taiwan. I would like to know her stand when it comes to China's position -- on the growing ambition of China, Diaz said. That is been a key theme of Haley's campaign, and Haley addressed China moments later during the town all. We need Ukraine to win, and you know who wants Ukraine to win more than anybody else? Haley told the crowd. Who wants us to continue in the West to continue to support Ukraine? The Taiwanese. Why? Because the Taiwanese know if Ukraine wins, China will not go into Taiwan.

Politicians and community leaders fear many communities will be left stranded and disconnected due to the scaled back timetables and cancellations of these crucial routes. Earlier this month First Cymru confirmed that as a result of reductions in Welsh Government funding, several of its services are being withdrawn, while several others will no longer run as frequently in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire. Among the changed and cancelled services, one service in Neath Port Talbot has been completely withdrawn on weekdays. Neath Port Talbot Council has expressed concern about this, and said it feared further reductions could follow in April, 2024. For residents in Llanelli, the cuts mean that from October 29, the L1, L2 and L3 services have all been cut, the 110 service to Swansea has been withdrawn and the X11 to Swansea is now to run every hour instead of every 30 minutes South Wales West Regional MS Altaf Hussain has reacted to First Cymru cancelling nine services and reducing the frequency of dozens of others throughout the region. He said: I am urging the Welsh Government to rethink its decision to reduce the subsidies for bus services. First Cymru has made it plain that it is these cuts that are the because of decisions to axe or reduce services. Without a subsidy, and with reduced passenger numbers, many services now cost more to operate than the income they receive. I know that Neath Port Talbot Council has lobbied Welsh Government on this and I fully support them. Many people totally rely on buses to get to work, attend health care appointments or for shopping and socialising. Without these services, people will be cut off and isolated. Once a route has ended, it is almost impossible to get it back and people are then forced to use expensive taxis or rely on friends and families. The Welsh Government is doing everything in its power to deter people from using their cars with its 20mph speed limit and to use public transport instead, but they have failed to invest in this. Our train services in Wales, which are run by Welsh Government, are officially classed as the most unreliable in the whole of the UK and now buses are being axed as well. Their transport policy is utterly incoherent and shambolic. Dr Hussain urged the Welsh Labour Government to ensure that the money that will come to Wales as a consequence of the decision to scrap parts of the HS2 rail scheme is used to support bus services as well as fund other improvements. Tom Giffard MS for South Wales West has branded cuts to bus services as reckless. He added: The Welsh Government's decision, which has led to First Cymru deciding to cut bus services in Swansea, shows a blatant disregard for the needs of our community. This move will further isolate residents, many of whom rely on these routes for work, school, medical appointments, and essential shopping. To boost the economy and deliver environmentally friendly public transport, it is vital that the concerns of local residents and businesses are listened to. Llanelli county councillors Michael Cranham and Sean Rees have also raised concern regarding the the L1 service, which goes through their wards of Bigyn and Glanymor, serving the communities of Penyfan, Seaside and Morfa. Cllr Cranham said: Many people in our communities including our elderly, disabled and parents with young children rely on buses to get around. We do fear these cuts to public transport will leave people isolated. We support the ongoing efforts to try and regenerate Llanelli town centre and a crucial aspect of that is accessibility and therefore we feel that these changes are a backward step, as there would be no bus service to and from the town centre in either mid to late afternoon or evening. Councillor Rees said: It is clear many are worried about the impact these cuts will have on their ability to be able to access essential services including hospital and doctors appointments, home to school travel and travel to work. A spokesperson for First Cymru said: It was inevitable that we needed to make changes to our bus network in Cymru when the Welsh government announced the lower levels of support. We recognise the government has had some tough decisions to make as it changes the way it funds bus services. But at the same time, we share the disappointment customers will feel from the knock-on impact that will have on some routes. Following requests from local councils, we have looked at our whole network to see where changes could be made to work within the reduced funding available, and while the majority of services will not be impacted, where we have made changes we have done all we can to save routes, even if this has meant having to reduce frequencies or hours of operation. Regrettably, some services, which are either being served by other routes or have particularly low passenger numbers, will stop operating. We remain committed to getting more people to use the bus, but adequate levels of funding are essential where passenger numbers are below the cost of operating services. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: We have provided the bus industry with more than 200m to support it through the pandemic and beyond. We continue to work with Transport for Wales and local authorities to provide more stable services. Our new bus legislation will set out how we intend to transform the way bus services are planned and delivered in the future.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"First Cymru confirmed that as a result of reductions in Welsh Government funding, several of its services are being withdrawn.

Deep and rapid emission cuts this decade are critical to avoid cataclysmic climate impacts and keep the 1.5C target of the Paris Agreement attainable. The EU's current targeted level of ambition for 2030 remains insufficient and does not reflect its fair contribution to the fight against the climate crisis. Bring forward the EU's climate neutrality target and commit to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 at the latest, with at least 92 gross emission cuts. In light of the advice of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) and the Paris Agreement's equity principles, the EU as a major historic emitter and industrialised economy bears a higher responsibility than the global average in the fight against the climate emergency. The EU should commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest and set climate targets aligned with the 5-year UNFCCC common timeframes agreed at the Glasgow COP, including for 2035. The Commission should make clear in their proposal for a 2040 target how the EU will close the eventual gap between a fair EU GHG budget that meets its responsibilities and a domestic target that takes into account an ambitious emissions pathway. This gap should be closed through additional mitigation measures in the EU and new and additional financial support to developing countries. This support should not result in funds being diverted from climate change adaptation and loss and damage commitments. Protect, restore and enhance Europe's natural carbon sinks, in particular through dedicated and immediate action to revitalise Europe's forests, wetlands, peatlands and agricultural soils at a much larger scale and pace and ensure net removals are additional to - and not used to offset - urgently needed emissions reductions in other sectors. Making Europe's natural sinks more resilient will not only constitute a key pillar in the EU's fight against the climate crisis, but is also essential in protecting and restoring Europe's biodiversity. Sufficient amounts of financing must result in significantly restoring nature across the EU. Step up adaptation to climate change at EU level. Europe is already facing catastrophic consequences of climate change and needs to prepare for adaptation. A binding European law on planned, ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change, grounded in climate justice, is needed. Implementing agro-ecological practices to reduce water consumption and soil degradation in the agricultural sector, greening cities, eliminating concrete surfaces to combat heat islands, and increasing resources dedicated to fire risk management are all effective long-term adaptation measures, which can help to reduce social inequalities. Ensure the EU leads by example for climate justice internationally. Europe needs to deliver on its obligations to the Global South with special attention to least developed countries and small island developing states. The EU should fully honour commitments to providing new and additional international climate finance for mitigation and adaptation, including the collective doubling of adaptation finance by 2025 (based on 2019 levels) in line with its fair share. Public finance contributions should be the focus, with grants and highly concessional finance for mitigation and grants for adaptation prioritised. The EU should also make multi-year pledges at a scale of billions of USD to the new Loss and Damage Fund, and find new revenues from equitable global, EU and national taxes and levies which make big polluters pay for climate damages.Urgent action is needed on debt and tax justice, through significant reform of the IMF and World Bank, debt cancellation, and a UN Tax Convention, to give countries the fiscal space they need for climate and development action. The EU should endorse an inclusive and feminist climate policy as a cornerstone of EU external action and diplomacy. A just approach to international climate action also means making sure its trade policy is supporting rather than contradicting climate and development objectives with trade, financing and investments built around development objectives rather than extraction of raw materials. End the fossil fuel era once and for all. Adopt binding phase-out dates and trajectories to seal the end of the use of coal (by 2030 at the latest), fossil gas (by 2035 at the latest) and fossil oil (by 2040 at the latest). This also necessitates the phase-out of unsustainable and costly technologies such as nuclear power. Ending the reliance on fossil fuels and uranium, which are largely imported, is essential to strengthen the EU's energy resilience, strategic autonomy and security. Put an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies in a socially just manner and stop fossil infrastructure expansion, including for liquefied gas. End the fossil fuel industry's excessive weight on EU and Member States' decision-making processes and stop giving the fossil gas industry another lifeline through ill-considered and inappropriate support for hydrogen. Support for hydrogen should be targeted at hard to electrify sectors only and be produced from additional renewable energy sources. Ensure the EU endorses and supports an international Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. Build a 100 renewable energy system by 2040 with people and nature at its heart. Speed and scale up the deployment of sustainable renewable energy such as wind and solar, and necessary infrastructure, while avoiding new hydropower plants and sources of bioenergy that increase emissions compared to fossil fuels, and ensure renewables provide a share of at least 50 of the EU's energy mix by 2030. Make sure the energy market is strong, resilient, flexible, and people-centred maximising the uptake of variable renewables, demand-side flexibility and electrification, providing affordable energy for all. Empower consumers (households, energy communities, businesses, and small and medium-sized industry) to be on top of their energy production and consumption and optimise the energy demandsupply, fully tapping into the huge benefits in terms of costs, raw material use and land savings from avoiding new infrastructure. Put in place strong support for flexibility measures such as demand side response and storage to ensure the energy system can deal with increasing supply of variable renewable energy. Since local authorities are a key actor in the deployment of renewable energy, European funding needs to be dedicated to local engineering in local authorities and the structures that support them, especially for more human resources and skills. Fully tap into Europe's energy savings potential and adopt EU-wide and national targets to cut energy consumption in half by 2040. Accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency and sufficiency measures in all sectors of the economy and mobilise investments at national, regional and local level to ensure at least 20 energy savings by 2030. Enable a tripling of the renovation rate and a large-scale roll-out of deep renovation for all occupants, a transport modal shift from inefficient aviation to rail and light efficient vehicles, more electric vehicles and the use of more efficient appliances. It will require building on lessons learned to enable structural change and further drastic changes in current production and consumption patterns, including a focus on sufficiency, repair, circularity, recycling, cutting industrial resource use and primary energy demand. Energy savings are key for making Europe independent from energy imports, while helping the economy, leading to more jobs, reducing energy waste, greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills. Advance the just transformation and make the European Green Deal the engine for new jobs. Support local communities of regions dependent on coal and carbon-intensive industries in decline with funds, tools and know-how so they can become prosperous, climate-neutrality oriented and resilient to socio-economic effects of the change. The process needs to be implemented in a transparent and participatory manner, in cooperation with citizens and stakeholders, with the full involvement of trade unions. The European Commission should issue targets and recommendations for qualification and employment in climate-friendly and circular-economy sectors. The Commission and Member States should draw up projections of the upcoming transformation at the regional level, identify potentials for new value-added and employment clusters and assess existing education and training needs. Education and training should be consistently geared towards climate-friendly employment, for example through retraining from automotive to recharging infrastructure, from the aviation to the rail industry, training programmes for the refurbishment of residential buildings, installation of heat pumps and solar panels or employment in the circular economy. Ensure a sustainable and fair natural resources management within and beyond the EU, effectively tackling over-production and over-consumption. Bring back Europe's resource consumption within planetary boundaries and setting ambitious and binding targets to reduce the EU's material footprint and achieve a fully circular economic model throughout all sectors. Ensure due diligence for social, environmental and human rights impacts in critical mineral supply chains, particularly in the Global South. Enhance social protection and cohesion through a redistributive agenda based on the polluter pays principle. Make sure that the costs and benefits of the transition are borne and shared equitably across society, with a greener fiscal system based on the principle that the polluter pays for the full societal harm caused as well as mechanisms to redistribute the costs of the transition fairly. For the transport sector, this entails taxing environmentally harmful fuels at the highest rate in a socially just manner and fully recycling revenues to further enhance climate action, in particular to make sustainable mobility affordable for low income households and massively invest into accelerated expansion of the European rail network. In the agricultural sector, this requires a complete overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards a system where subsidies are strictly linked to sustainable agricultural practices, accelerating an agroecological transition away from industrial agriculture with reduced industrial livestock farming. Increase social resilience and strengthen the increase of dedicated funds enhancing social cohesion and fighting energy poverty, such as the Social Climate Fund, public goods and services for all through policies that enhance the fair redistribution of wealth and resources, sustainability, protection of biodiversity, gender responsiveness, racial equity and societal wellbeing. Align financial flows with the fight against the climate and biodiversity crises. The EU should exclude any possibility of using EU funds for new fossil fuel investments and infrastructure projects in Europe and internationally which increase fossil fuel use. This includes immediately closing all the loopholes that remain in several large EU funding instruments including the Recovery and Resilience Facility and cohesion policy funds and permanently excluding all fossil fuel finance from 2025 onwards. Reform the EU public debt and deficit rules and establish a new EU fund for climate and just transformation to enable the needed investments in the just and green transition. Revise the EU taxonomy to exclude nuclear and gas from green labelling, and regulate private finance to maximise its support to the green transition. Strengthen, protect, resource and support civil society and youth organisations, independent science and research and media across Europe. Protect and expand civic spaces at EU, national and local levels through effective, transparent and timely public participation in policy-making, implementation and expansion of citizens' assemblies and other innovative forms of civic participation at all levels, and firm action against threats or breaches of the rule of law. Ensure meaningful youth participation in formal policy processes and enable young people to design their own future through supporting youth-led initiatives. Strengthen the role of local authorities, citizens and community-led grassroots initiatives in EU decision-making processes and resource them adequately as they are at the forefront of the action against climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Guarantee current and future generations' fundamental rights to a healthy environment, to enjoy a life with dignity and environmental protection. Strengthen citizens' rights to access to justice and improve compliance with environmental and climate obligations at national, EU and international level. Facilitate litigation to hold accountable governments, business and financial institutions for their ongoing investments in fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries and the related human rights effects that such investments can provoke.

The train derailed at KM 5204 at the crossing between Sentolo and Wates stations in Kulon Progo district of Yogyakarta on Tuesday (October 17, 2023). We are coordinating with the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) to investigate the because of the train's derailment, said Didiek Hartantyo, President Director of KAI, in Kulon Progo. KAI has investigated the driver of Argo Semeru train and the driver of Argo Wilis train, which brushed past it soon after the derailment, resulting in both rail tracks getting blocked and both trains suffering damage. Based on a preliminary investigation, the Argo Wilis train driver had time to brake, but the distance was too close, making the accident unavoidable, Hartantyo informed. We do not want to conclude the because of the incident yet. The condition of the train is also roadworthy, and all procedures have been carried out, he added.

Please try again later verifyErrors  Network Rail is failing to prevent safety risks from unacceptable overcrowding at London's Euston station, regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said. Passengers waiting on the station's concourse often surge forwards when information boards reveal what platform their train is departing from. The ORR visited the station last month after analysing CCTV footage of three incidents of concern in the summer, which showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels and a lack of crowd control. There were reports of minor injuries and the potential for more serious consequences, the regulator said. The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services - such as those in the early morning and late afternoon - are more expensive and less used compared with off-peak services. This can result in overcrowding on off-peak trains at major stations. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said: Managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge, a challenge that our dedicated cross-industry team rise to each day, always putting passengers' wellbeing and safety at the forefront of their minds. Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. The ORR has asked us to look at some other specific areas and our team, along with our train operating colleagues, are already on the case making further improvements. Euston was the UK's fifth busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Passengers waiting on concourse often surge forwards when information boards reveal what platform their train is departing from.

Low pressure areas (LPAs) are linked to the convergence and upward motion of air, forming closed, anti-clockwise wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. And these systems can bring a ton of rainfall across the country when they cross the coasts. Amid the northeast monsoon's impeded arrival due to the southwest monsoon's reluctance to leave, a pair of rain-bearing systems are brewing on either side of South Peninsular India, threatening wet weather to those parts of the sub-continent. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic circulation lying over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea is likely to move west-northwestwards. During this period, it is expected to influence the formation of a low pressure area in the central parts of the Bay by Friday, October 20. In the meantime, another cyclonic circulation that has been stationed over the southeast Arabian Sea since Monday has now given way to the formation of a low pressure area in the region. Weather models indicate that this system will trudge west-northwestwards, developing into a well-marked low pressure area over the next 24 hours and then a depression over the Central Arabian Sea around Saturday, October 21. Its potential strength remains ambiguous for now, but should it further intensify, this system will become the first post-monsoon cyclone in the Arabian Sea this year. It will then be named 'Tej' in accordance with the naming list followed for cyclones in the Indian Ocean region. Accordingly, the IMD has predicted up to moderate showers accompanied by thunderstorms and lighting in Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Wednesday, October 18. Some scattered to fairly widespread rains might permeate South Interior Karnataka as well. Thunderstorm activity is expected to prevail over Kerala until October 19 while light to moderate rains are likely in Tamil Nadu until October 23. Given these predictions, a yellow watch has been issued across Kerala and Tamil Nadu for today so as to urge locals to 'be updated' about the inclement weather. Fisherfolk along the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts have been cautioned against venturing into sea today and tomorrow. Rough sea conditions are likely between October 20 and 22. Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted that the northeast monsoon will arrive in Tamil Nadu between October 23-25, meaning the southern state could witness an almost continuous supply of rains in the coming days.

The latest indication for this was the cancelation of a summit between YOU.S. President Joe Biden and the presidents of Egypt and Palestine, to be held in Jordan. Jordan canceled the summit on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Jordanian King Abdullah has blamed the tragedy at the Gaza hospital on Israel.

Blast kills hundreds at Gaza hospital; Hamas and Israel trade blame, as Biden heads to Mideast KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Around them in the grass were blankets, school backpacks and other belongings. Outrage over what many believed was an Israeli strike flared across the region, a day before President Joe Biden was due to arrive to show support for Israel and try to prevent the war from spreading. The carnage unfolded as the YOU.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas' deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hamas called Tuesday's hospital blast a horrific massacre, saying it was caused by an Israeli strike. The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often cooperates with Hamas in their shared struggle against Israel. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital at the time and that intelligence from multiple sources indicated it was responsible for the failed rocket launch that hit the hospital. Destruction at Gaza hospital increases stakes for Biden's trip to Israel and Jordan WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's efforts to tamp down tensions in the escalating war between Israel and Hamas faced a bloody setback Tuesday when, shortly before his expected departure for the Middle East, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas withdrew from scheduled meetings to protest an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike but the Israeli military said it had no involvement and pinned the blame on a misfired Palestinian rocket. Abbas' cancellation, disclosed by a senior Palestinian official, reflects an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of American influence in the region as Biden visits Israel and Jordan on Wednesday. Biden's decision to put himself in a conflict zone -- the same year he made a surprise visit to Ukraine -- demonstrates his willingness to take personal and political risks as he becomes heavily invested in another intractable foreign conflict with no clear end game and plenty of opportunity for things to spiral out of control. The high-stakes presidential trip is emblematic of Biden's belief that the United States should not turn back from its central role on the global stage and his faith that personal diplomacy can play a decisive role. War between Israel and Hamas raises fears about rising US hostility A fatal stabbing in Illinois, a gun pointed at protesters in Pennsylvania, vandalism at synagogues and harassment of staff at a Palestinian restaurant all are raising fears that the war between Israel and Hamas is sparking violence in the United States. The tensions follow a familiar pattern of crimes against Jewish and Muslim communities rising when conflict erupts in the Middle East and Americans have been killed or taken hostage. We have a two pronged threat to American faith communities, said Brian Levin, founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernadino. While it is too soon to say with certainty whether anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish crimes have increased during the war, hate crimes overall increased in the YOU.S. last year. In its annual report released Monday, the FBI estimated that hate crimes increased by 7 to 11,634 cases in 2022 compared to the previous year. With 1,124 incidents, anti-Jewish attacks were the second most reported hate crime, after anti-Black cases. There were 158 reported incidents of anti-Muslim attacks, and 92 reports of anti-Arab cases, according to the report. Civil rights organizations, however, believe that even before the Hamas attacks in Israel, crime data did not reflect reality due to a lack of participation by local police departments and internalized fear among the Muslim population, said Robert McCaw, director of governmental affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In 2021, the Othering  Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, released a study in which 85 of those who were subjected to Islamophobia said they did not report it to authorities. Republicans reject Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot, signaling more turmoil ahead WASHINGTON (AP) -- More turmoil ahead, Republicans rejected Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot Tuesday, as an unexpectedly numerous 20 holdouts denied the hard-charging ally of Donald Trump the GOP majority needed to seize the gavel. Additional voting was postponed as the House hit a standstill, stuck while Jordan works to shore up support from Republican colleagues to replace the ousted Kevin McCarthy for the job. Reluctant Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. Next votes were expected Wednesday. We are going to keep working, Jordan said at the Capitol as evening fell. It is been two weeks of angry Republican infighting since McCarthy's sudden removal by hard-liners, who are now within reach of a central seat of YOU.S. power. The vote for House speaker, once a formality in Congress, has devolved into another bitter showdown for the gavel. Jordan said after the first vote that he was not surprised and expected to do better in the next round. But the afternoon dragged on with no further votes Tuesday. Trump returns to his civil fraud trial, hears an employee and an appraiser testify against him NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump returned Tuesday to the civil fraud trial that imperils his real estate empire, watching and deploring the case as an employee and an outside appraiser testified that his company essentially put a thumb on the scale when sizing up his properties' value. Incensed by a case that disputes his net worth and could strip him of such signature holdings as Trump Tower, the former president is due to testify later in the trial. But he chose to attend the first three days and came back Tuesday to observe -- and to protest his treatment to the news cameras waiting outside the Manhattan courtroom. Star witness Michael Cohen, a onetime Trump fixer now turned foe, postponed his scheduled testimony because of a health problem. Instead, Trump company accountant Donna Kidder testified that she was told to make some assumptions favorable to the firm on internal financial spreadsheets. Outside appraiser Doug Larson said he did not suggest or condone a former Trump Organization comptroller's methods of valuing properties. It does not make sense, Larson said of the way the ex-controller reached a 287.6 million value for a prominent Trump-owned retail space in 2013. Ukraine uses US-provided long-range ATACMS missiles against Russian forces for the first time WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has quietly delivered a small number of long-range ballistic missiles that Ukraine said it urgently needed and that President Joe Biden promised last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Tuesday, saying they were used on the battlefield against Russia and executed very accurately. Today I express special gratitude to the United States, Zelenskyy said in his evening address, adding that the missiles have proven themselves. The YOU.S. has refused to discuss the delivery publicly, but officials familiar with the move also confirmed it earlier in the day. Fewer than a dozen of the missiles got into Ukraine within the last few days, said officials. Their arrival at the warfront gives Ukraine a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before an official announcement and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The delivery of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, was shrouded in secrecy, with the expectation that the first public acknowledgment would come when the missiles were used on the battlefield. That intense secrecy is a marked change from previous YOU.S. weapons sent by the Biden administration. In nearly all other cases, the YOU.S. has publicly announced its decision prior to the weapons and equipment being shipped overseas. Because of lingering YOU.S. concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (about 300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range and carry cluster munitions, which, when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead. According to a YOU.S. official, the ones delivered to Ukraine have a maximum range of a bit more than 100 miles (roughly 160 kilometers). Belgian police kill Tunisian man suspected of shooting 3 Swedish soccer fans, killing 2 of them BRUSSELS (AP) -- Authorities in the Belgian capital shot and killed a Tunisian national on Tuesday hours after they say he gunned down three Swedish soccer fans, killing two of them, and posted a video online in which he claimed credit for the attack and said the Quran was a red line for which he is ready to sacrifice himself. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive for Monday night's attack, which happened not far from where Belgium's men's soccer team was hosting Sweden in a European Championships qualifier. The match was suspended at halftime and the more than 35,000 fans were kept inside the stadium as a precaution while the attacker was at large. Amateur videos of the attack posted on social media showed a man wearing an orange fluorescent vest pull up on a scooter, take out a large weapon and open fire on people getting out of a taxi. He chased them into a building to gun them down. He was also filmed calmly loading his weapon as cars drove by slowly. Sweden's foreign ministry said the men who were killed were in their 60s and 70s, and the man who was wounded is in his 70s and remains hospitalized. Hours after the suspect disappeared into the night and a manhunt was launched, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap Are 3D mammograms better than standard 2D imaging for catching advanced cancers? A clinical trial is recruiting thousands of volunteers -- including a large number of Black women who face disparities in breast cancer death rates -- to try to find out. People like Carole Stovall, a psychologist in Washington, D.C., have signed up for the study to help answer the question. We all need a mammogram anyway, so why not do it with a study that allows the scientists to understand more and move closer to finding better treatments and ways of maybe even preventing it? Stovall said. The underrepresentation of women and minorities in research is a long-simmering issue affecting health problems including Alzheimer's disease, stroke and COVID-19. Trials without diversity lead to gaps in understanding of how new treatments work for all people. Broken rail caused fatal Colorado train derailment that collapsed bridge, early findings show A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. Prosecutors seeking to recharge Alec Baldwin in fatal shooting on set of Western movie 'Rust' SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Special prosecutors are seeking to recharge actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie in 2021, describing Tuesday their preparations to present new information to a grand jury. New Mexico-based prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said they will present their case to the grand jury within the next two months, noting additional facts have come to light in the shooting on the set of the film Rust that killed Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin, a coproducer of the film, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a rustic chapel on a movie-set ranch near Santa Fe when the gun went off on October 21, 2021, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza. Additional facts have come to light that we believe show Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza, Morrissey and Lewis said in an email. We believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of New Mexico citizens to determine from here whether Mr. Baldwin should be held over for criminal trial. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer -- but not the trigger -- and the gun fired. Newsletters Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Rescue vehicles and over a half a dozen police cars were seen amid the pileup around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. As Breitbart News reported, Jim Jordan was denied the Speaker of the House gavel on Tuesday due to 20 Republican holdouts, including John Rutherford. The six Republican holdouts voting for Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Mike Lawler (R-NY), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-NE), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) and Don Bacon (R-NE). McCarthy has endorsed Jordan and voted for him, said the report.

Scalise withdrew from the race last week after failing to see a path to victory. He, too, voted for Jordan, it added. Democrats have largely celebrated the holdouts as a delay of Jordan's speakership bid.

Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. High levels of arsenic have been found in ash on Maui, posing a potential health risk to anyone exposed to the debris from wildfires that damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings and claimed the lives of at least 98 people in early August. The findings, along with warnings to avoid contact with the ash, were announced in a news release Sunday from the Hawaii Department of Health. The preliminary analysis of ash from the remains of eight homes burned in the community of Kula also show other toxins including lead and cobalt. (MORE: West Maui Begins Reopening To Tourists) The blaze was one of several fires fueled by high winds and dry conditions in central and western Maui, including one that leveled the town of Lahaina on August 8. Officials expect to find similar toxins in the piles of ash there. Where Did The Arsenic Come From And Why Is It Dangerous? Arsenic is present in building materials made from sugar cane, commonly used in some older buildings in Hawaii. It is also found in Hawaii's volcanic soils. Wildfire ash is known to contain all kinds of toxins from metal, paint, wood, chemicals and anything else that might burn in a fire. But the high concentration of arsenic is of particular concern to Hawaii health officials. While the presence of these substances is not unexpected, the concentration of arsenic in particular demonstrates the high toxicity of the ash and reinforces the importance of avoiding exposure to the ash, State Health Director Dr. Kenneth Fink said. Parents Worry Air Is not Safe For Kids To Breathe Concern over toxins in the wildfire debris is one reason access to Lahaina is still being strictly monitored more than two months after the historic town burned. I feel like it is like back to COVID, where every decision you make is wrong and you are, like, putting your kids' lives at risk, Debbie Tau, who has two school-aged children, told The Associated Press. Tau worries the air is not safe for her children to breathe, and plans to keep them in a different school farther away. (MORE: 911 Calls From Deadly Lahaina Wildfire Show Residents' Terror And Desperation To Escape) School officials say they are monitoring the air quality and taking other steps to help make sure students are not exposed to toxins from the ash. The Department of Education continues to strongly believe that reopening our Lhain schools for in-person learning is critical for the well-being of our students and the community. We have been reassured that our campuses are safe for students and staff to be at based on current air quality conditions and the extensive environmental testing we have done over the last several weeks, DOE Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in the news release. No One Knows When Residents Can Return To Lahaina The Health Department says anyone in the area should take steps to limit contact with toxins in wildfire debris. It is important to remember that people can take action to minimize their exposure to these contaminants, including avoiding disruption of ash and wearing proper PPE when in impacted areas, Fink said. In addition, for people near the impacted areas, keeping surfaces clean of dust and ash and frequent handwashing will greatly reduce exposure. (MORE: Veteran Firefighter Describes Search Through Ashes of Lahaina Fire) There is no specific timeline for when residents might be allowed to return to Lahaina. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen has said it could be up to two years before people can even begin rebuilding their homes and disaster experts say it will take much longer than that to recover.

The ministry's spokesman, Ashraf Al Qudra, estimated that at least 200 were injured. Officials in Gaza and in Israel blamed each other for the carnage. Al Qudra said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had targeted the hospital for bombing. Hamas also blamed Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that, saying, It was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the IDF. Photos of the hospital showed fire engulfing the halls, shattered glass and body parts scattered across the wreckage. Videos posted to a Palestinian paramedic's Instagram stories show first responders arriving at the hospital and taking bloodied bodies out. Looking visibly she will-shocked in a video shared with NBC News, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah said there were three artillery attacks on the hospital. Part of the roof started to fall, he said, as he was treating a patient for a jugular injury. If the hospital bombing death toll of 200-300 is confirmed, it would be the deadliest incident inside Gaza since Hamas' terror attack on Israel on October 7. Doctors Without Borders said on the X platform that it was horrified by the bombing. This is a massacre. It is absolutely unacceptable, the organization said in a statement. The World Health Organization said it strongly condemns the attack. The hospital was operational, with patients, health and care givers, and internally displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries, it said in a statement. The WHO also said Israel's orders to evacuate the north side of the Gaza Strip last week -- the equivalent of 1.1 million people -- has been impossible to carry out for al Ahli and other hospitals. Before the hospital bombing, the estimated death toll in Gaza was more than 3,000 people, with more than 12,500 estimated to be injured. Israel's evacuation orders came as it appeared ready to launch a ground invasion into Gaza, bringing scores of military equipment to the border after Hamas terrorists killed 1,400 people and wounded 4,000 people in kibbutzim, at a musical festival and in streets across the south. The situation for civilians in Gaza has grown increasingly dire as Israel continues its airstrikes and imposes a blockade of water, food, fuel, medical supplies and electricity. Those resources are now in short supply, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled south. The bombing is the latest hit to the medical community in Gaza, which is already on the brink of collapse. Hospitals have provided refuge for people trying to escape the bombardment of the besieged enclave since last week. Dr. Ahmad Moghrabi, head of plastic surgery at Gaza's Nasser Hospital, likened the medical situation in Gaza to a disaster, and said most of his patients are women and children. It is like earthquake, everybody under attack, he said in a video diary sent to NBC News on Tuesday, where he is seen sobbing at his desk. Even my child -- 3 years old, she got injured. Really, it is pitiful -- my heart. Really, I am speaking to you, I want to cry.

Rachel Powell, a Pennsylvania woman in her early 40s, mother of eight and grandmother of six, was convicted on nine federal counts back in July after a bench trial. Federal prosecutors sought eight years in federal prison for Powell, saying she developed an obsession with keeping former President Trump in power after his 2020 election loss, and that she even conducted surveillance at a female legislator's home before taking part in the Capitol attack. Powell, in emotional comments during her sentencing, said she did not want there to be any doubt about what she thought of what she did. I am deeply ashamed of my conduct, she said. I regret it, and it will never happen again. Powell said she feels remorse and regret every day. My conduct was disgraceful, Powell said. I apologize to my family for the hell they have endured because of me.

In the immediate aftermath of January 6, she said it WAS F--KING WAR TO GET IN, that rioters were not f--king welcomed in and that police had to retreat into the building and fight back because patriots were relentless.

It is revolting and dangerous to tear people apart right now with cruel poison that undermines our basic values as Americans, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to NBC News. And no one who praises Iran-backed terrorist groups has any credibility when it comes to protecting our national security from terrorist threats. Biden, and his White House, have been in recent weeks increasingly willing to engage with Trump, who remains far and away the frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. On Monday, Trump called for a new -- and more expansive -- ban on immigrants from certain countries, and for the first time, he included Gaza. As a candidate in 2015, Trump first proposed a total shutdown on Muslims entering the YOU.S. As president, he tried to enact a sweeping executive order, which was eventually limited to five Muslim-majority countries, along with North Korea and Venezuela. Biden then rescinded that ban when he took office. Following the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, President Biden has been unequivocal: There is no place for hate in America -- not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anyone. On his very first day in office, President Biden was proud to rescind the hateful Muslim travel ban instituted by his predecessor, which violates core Americans principles, Bates said, adding, After the terrorist atrocities in Israel and after heartbreaking murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American child this week -- a 6-year-old child -- this is a moment when all leaders need to come together against hate; against Islamophobia, against antisemitism. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said it was incorrect to call it a Muslim ban and it showed how stupid the Biden people are. Truly moronic. Trump has faced significant criticism -- including from within his own party -- for his initial response to the Hamas attacks on Israel. He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and praised Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group designated by the YOU.S. as a terrorist group, as very smart. Since then, Trump has chosen a different approach, being sure to emphasize that he stands with Israel and supports a harsh approach toward Hamas and anyone who might have a whiff of support for Hamas. On Monday, Trump also said he would proactively send immigration agents to pro-jihadist demonstrations in the YOU.S. to remove noncitizens and implement strong ideological screening of all immigrants, which would include a person's rejection of Hamas. Bates said immigrants already undergo extensive vetting. There is strict national security vetting to determine whether individuals coming from anywhere in the world have ties to terrorist organizations, he said, adding that no one who praises Iran-backed terrorist groups has any credibility when it comes to protecting our national security from terrorist threats. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Within the Republican field, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has fought to outflank Trump on the right of the Israel issue, first calling for a ban on refugees from Gaza and baselessly claiming that Palestinians are all antisemitic. On Tuesday, he also said he opposed sending any humanitarian aid to Gaza.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The White House is going after former President Donald Trump's response to the Israel-Hamas war.

The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a ban on using formaldehyde as an ingredient in hair relaxers, a huge step in raising awareness about the potential harms these products create for the many Black women that typically use them. The proposed rule would ban the chemical in hair-smoothing or hair-straightening products, also called relaxers. The FDA currently discourages consumers from using hair-straightening products that contain formaldehyde and similar ingredients, according to a fact sheet from the agency. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas that is used in a wide range of household products, including medicines and cosmetics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is highly toxic, and repeated exposure can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, lungs and throat. It is also linked to certain cancers, including myeloid leukemia, a cancer that occurs in the blood and bone marrow, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even products that do not contain formaldehyde as a main ingredient may contain other ingredients that, when heated, can be converted into formaldehyde, such as methylene glycol, which is found in some hair-straightening products. Some soaps, shampoos, lotions and cleaning products contain formalin, which is formaldehyde dissolved in water. The current law does not require the FDA to approve cosmetic products and ingredients before they go on the market -- only color additives, according to the agency's website. Companies and individuals selling products have a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of their products, the agency says, but federal law and regulations do not require companies to share their safety information with the FDA. Research in recent years has helped raise awareness about the potential dangers of using chemical hair relaxers. A study published last year by the National Institutes of Health found that women who used hair-straightening chemicals more than four times in the previous year were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the products. While the study did not collect information on specific brands or ingredients used by the participants, the researchers noted that formaldehyde, parabens and other ingredients found in chemical hair straighteners may contribute to the increased risk of uterine cancer. Additional research published this month by Boston University's Black Women's Health Study -- a long-running study, launched in 1995, that tracks the health of 59,000 Black women -- found that postmenopausal Black women who used chemical hair straighteners long term had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. The study was designed to emphasize the dangers of chemical hair straighteners and help identify safer alternatives, said Kimberly Bertrand, the study's lead author and an associate professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. We know that these products are very poorly regulated by the federal government in terms of what goes in there, Bertrand said. You cannot look at an ingredient label and know that it contains these endocrine disruptors. They do not list phthalates and parabens on the box -- they say fragrance and preservative. So, women do not really know what they are being exposed to. Endocrine disruptors are often found in chemical hair straighteners and can be absorbed into the body when the product is placed on the scalp, Bertrand said. These chemicals can interfere with the body's endocrine, or hormone, system, and are linked to early onset of puberty, fibroid tumors and infertility, she added. An additional study published by the American Journal of Epidemiology in March found that current and former use of chemical hair straighteners was associated with lower fertility in women. Several Black women within the past year have filed lawsuits against Revlon, L'oreal and other cosmetic brands, alleging that the companies' hair straightening products caused the women to develop uterine cancer, breast cancer and other health complications. In other cases, women also claimed the products caused infertility. The FDA's proposed ban comes months after Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, wrote an open letter in March requesting the federal agency to conduct an investigation to determine if chemical hair straighteners contain carcinogens that lead to a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. Many Black women use these hair straightening products to adapt to societal standards as a result of anti-Black hair sentiment, the letter stated. In addition to the FDA's proposed ban, Pressley and other advocates have pushed for policies like the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, known as the CROWN Act, which prohibits employment and educational discrimination based on hair texture. Since the YOU.S. House of Representatives passed the bill in March 2022, more than 20 states have followed suit, including Texas, where a Black teenager was suspended earlier this year after school officials said his dreadlocks violated the district's dress code.

The situation at the Rafah crossing was growing increasingly desperate as massive civilian crowds were still under threat of falling bombs while unable to access convoys of water, food, hygiene items, blankets, tents, and medical supplies sitting unused in neighboring Egypt, according the United Nations. The border crossing with Egypt has been shuttered since October 7, when Hamas launched a barrage of coordinated attacks on Israel, whose military responded in an all-out siege on the Gaza Strip. After a week of fighting, tons of essential goods poured into Egypt's El Arish International Airport over the weekend from Jordan, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, before being shipped to Gaza aboard hundreds of big rigs. The World Health Organization sent medical supplies from a hub in Dubai to help those injured in the crossfire, as well as those suffering from trauma or persistent health conditions like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The YOU.N. World Food Program was also delivering food and water to Gaza, which had no fuel, electricity and limited access to clean drinking water as Israel's bombing campaign continued to pummel major population centers, reducing them to rubble. Previously, YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Israel to open a safe aid delivery corridor as Gaza was running out of basic supplies to support life. On Tuesday, Tamara Alrifai, who serves as the spokesperson for the YOU.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, urged Israel to reopen the border crossing to allow the crowds to reach the desperately needed aid. In one episode, about 6,000 civilian refugees were huddled in a warehouse in southern Gaza with little if anything to eat or drink, she told CNBC. Over the last two days, reports of about 1 million people -- that is a sea of people -- going south moved using whatever means they could and given the lack of fuel in Gaza a lot of them moved by feet, Alrifai said. So, the images we have been receiving from my colleagues are harrowing images of people on their feet walking under airstrikes and air bombings to try to find shelter in a safer area. Over the weekend, YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Rafah border crossing would be reopened as Israel initiated a ground invasion into the Palestinian enclave, where more than 2 million civilians were trapped in a worsening humanitarian crisis. However, discussions to resolve the matter broke down Monday after Egypt's leadership refused to open their side of the crossing unless Israel let the waiting supplies into Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced pressure from Washington to allow humanitarian aid to come into Gaza as water and other supplies were starting to run out. But Netanyahu's office said Monday that Israel had received no assurances from Hamas on a cease-fire agreement that would allow the aid into Gaza and the refugees to seek safer ground in Egypt.

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit vital military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear programme. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The US unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a US aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the spectre of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a US plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The US has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in the production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defence ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments have been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Ahmad Hasaballah  Getty Images The taps in the besieged Gaza Strip are running dry, and residents are scrambling to save every last drop of water as the shortage reaches a crisis point. Dunia Aburahma said her family has rationed supplies, allowing her only a quart of drinking water per day. I have not taken a shower for four days now, said Aburahma, 22, an architecture student who fled northern Gaza with her family last week ahead of Israel's threatened ground invasion and is now living with relatives in Zawaida in central Gaza. After Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel left at least 1,400 people dead and about 200 people taken hostage, Israel announced a full blockade of Gaza, preventing food, water and fuel from entering the area, which is home to 2 million people. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Gaza and about 12,000 people have been wounded. The lack of water is so dire that surgeons at Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital have reverted to chemical disinfectants. Water pressure down in hospital to the point we cannot sterilize instruments, Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon at the hospital, said in a message over WhatsApp. At the heart of the water supply issue is the lack of fuel and electricity, which powers everything from water pumps to treatment centers. Only about 10 of Gaza's water comes from Israel; most of what residents drink is drilled locally, and then needs to be treated to remove salt and contamination, said Elai Rettig, an assistant professor at Bar-Ilan University who studies environmental policy. But about 50 of Gaza's electricity comes from Israel, while the rest is generated in Gaza with diesel-powered generators. Much of Gaza's fuel is trucked in from a refinery in Haifa, and Hamas has rapidly diminished Gaza's supplies for its own use. Without enough fuel and electricity to run the desalination and water treatment plants, there is no clean water to flow through the pipes, Rettig said in an interview Monday. And so the major consequence of cutting electricity supply is not necessarily electricity, but water supply to the population, Rettig said. And that is where things can become a humanitarian crisis. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) warned in a situation report Tuesday that concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases are high given the collapse of water and sanitation services. Water remains a key issue as people will start dying without water, the group said. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday that the YOU.S. and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. Even before the current conflict, 97 of the population of Gaza had to rely on informal and unregulated private water tankers and small-scale informal desalination plants for drinking water, according to a 2021 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Direct pipelines were a luxury, and the risk of waterborne diseases was rampant. The private water tankers would load up at the nearest water station and then go around to neighborhoods. Those who are in need of water could fill their tanks, which are usually placed on the roofs of their homes. But those tankers run on fuel, which is now in short supply. And water pulled directly from the ground, which would require electricity and then treatment, is unsafe to drink. The situation is near catastrophic, Imene Trabelsi, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told NBC News on Tuesday, adding that there were already reports of water contamination, which can pose serious health risks. Trabelsi said the two main water desalination stations in Gaza were no longer functioning. Aburahma's family was among the approximately 1 million people who have been displaced in Gaza since the conflict began, according to the UNRWA. Many of them moved from northern Gaza to the south over the past several days after Israeli authorities said they would resume supplying water in the south, as a way to make people leave the north, amid an anticipated ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza City. Israel's bombardments and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people to the south have put pressure on Gaza's infrastructure, and water has not arrived to places where people need it. The UNRWA said Israel had supplied water for only three hours in parts of southern Gaza on Monday. We cannot get our clothes cleaned, said Aburahma, who is staying at a relative's house with 53 other people. Whenever I need to clean some of the laundry, I fill a bottle of the water we keep and a bit of soap to clean them on my hands. Jonathan Conricus, international spokesman for Israel Defense Forces, blamed Hamas for using goods, including fuel, that could support civilians in Gaza. The people in Gaza are not our enemies, Conricus told NBC News' Tom Llamas. We are not targeting them. Palestinian authorities say that even if Israel were to resume supplying more water, without power, it cannot be pumped to homes. For us as a water authority, if Israel pumps water, it cannot be supplied to the population due to the interruption of the electricity required to pump it, the Palestinian Water Authority told NBC News in a Facebook message. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands have fled after the evacuation order, the water pressure was so low that Rahaf Abuzarifa was using cups and buckets to collect any drops that would fall. We gave each a 2-liter bottle and each one is managing his own bottle, said Abuzarifa, 21, who is living in a house with 17 other people. Those 2 liters must last for three days, she said, adding that everyone in the family had only taken a bath once since the war broke out earlier this month.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Residents are scrambling to save every last drop of water as the shortage reaches a crisis point.

The record confirms that this part of the world's largest rainforest is suffering its worst drought, just a little over two years after its most significant flooding. In the morning, the water level in the city's port went as low as 44.3 feet, down from 98.5 feet registered in June 2021 -- its highest level on record. The Negro River drains about 10 of the Amazon basin and is the world's sixth largest by water volume. Madeira River, another main tributary of the Amazon, has also recorded historically low levels, causing the halt of the Santo Antonio hydroelectric dam, Brazil's fourth largest. Throughout Brazil's Amazon, low river levels have left hundreds of riverine communities isolated and struggling to get access to drinkable water. The drought also has disrupted commercial navigation that supplies Manaus, a city of 2 million with a large industrial park. Manaus is the largest city and capital of Amazonas, the state hit hardest by the drought. In late September, 55 of 62 municipalities there entered states of emergency due to the severe drought. There is no more water to go through. Navigation is over, boatman Cledson Lopes Brasil told The Associated Press. (MORE: Floating Amazon Village Sunk To Dry Lake Bed) Brasil operates in Marina do Davi port, a getaway to dozens of riverine communities, some of them with sandy beaches that attract tourists. The once bustling area is now surrounded by parched soil, with many boathouses high and dry. Manaus and other nearby cities are also suffering from high temperatures and heavy smoke from nearby man-caused fires for deforestation and pasture clearance. The drought is also the likely because of dozens of river dolphin deaths in Tefe Lake, near the Amazon River. This is a startling contrast to July 2021, when Negro River waters took over part of the Manaus downtown area. The historic flood, which also ruined crops of hundreds of riverine communities, lasted for about three months. Negro River ends near Manaus, where it converges with the Amazon River, which is called the Solimoes River in Brazil upstream from this confluence. In Brazilian maps, this marks the beginning of the Amazon, with Negro as the second main tributary. In international maps, however, the Amazon River begins in Peru. Philip Fearnside, an American researcher at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research, a public agency, expects the situation to deteriorate, both during the ongoing event and in the future with increasing frequency and severity of similar events with climate change. (MORE: El Nio October Update: Strong Event Still Favored This Winter) He said surface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is now warmer than during the Godzilla El Nio of 2015-16 and is expanding. In the Amazon, these Pacific warmings primarily lead to droughts in the northern part of the region. Moreover, a warm water patch in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean is causing drought in the southern part of the Amazon, similar to what happened in 2005 and 2010, according to researchers. The forecast is for the start of the rains to be delayed compared to normal, and for a drier-than-normal rainy season, Fearnside said. This could result not only in extreme low water this year, but also low levels in 2024. Until the rainy season begins in the basin, the situation that is already underway should worsen.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Negro River, the Amazon's second largest tributary, on Monday reached its lowest level since official measurements began 121 years ago.

Blinken, Netanyahu and the Israeli war Cabinet were forced to hide in a bunker for five minutes before moving their meeting to an underground military command center, an indelible reminder of the fragility of life near the front lines. After nine hours of discussions, some with his Israeli counterparts and some with his YOU.S. team, Blinken emerged to say that President Joe Biden would visit Israel on Wednesday to demonstrate America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security and that Netanyahu had promised to work to secure humanitarian assistance for Palestinians. The United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza and them alone, including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way, Blinken said. That plan, whose details have not been released, represents a small but significant step in the direction of America's goals for managing the crisis -- and a personal diplomatic achievement for Blinken. For nearly a week, Biden's top emissary and longtime confidant has lived at the brink of an unfolding war in the Middle East, shuttling among seven countries over the past 133 hours as he articulates why America is supporting Israel's counter-offensive while seeking to keep other nations on the sidelines and limit the loss of civilian life on both sides of the Gaza border. Along the way, Blinken spoke with Biden daily -- every airplane ride or when we got back to the hotel, according to top Blinken adviser Derek Chollet -- to stay in close coordination. He is making a Herculean effort to stay in touch with the Arab World and trying to convince them that this is a different time for Israel, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who spoke at length with Blinken by phone Sunday night. The job of the secretary of state right now is to convince the region and the world writ large that this attack has changed the game -- that the old way of doing business died with the babies killed by Hamas -- and to prepare the Arab world for some tough times. Importantly, Graham added, he is also trying to get Israel to do all they can to minimize casualties. Blinken's charge is to make room for Israel to destroy Hamas without drawing Arab nations or their populations into the fight, which may require persuading Israel to exercise more restraint in its response than its leaders envision and convincing the Arab world that Israel is, in fact, doing that. As he spoke with Netanyahu, Israeli forces appeared to be on the verge of a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. It would be a monumental task for any diplomat in any era to contain a conflagration in the world's oldest tinder box, much less in the midst of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a massacre in Sudan. In that mission, Blinken has the confidence of Biden and top White House officials. The challenges we face in the Middle East and around the world require a secretary of State who is respected, who everyone knows speaks directly for the president, who has worked these issues going back many years, and who can get things done, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said in a statement. Secretary Blinken's deliberate marathon diplomacy across the region over the past few days is just the latest example of the great value he brings to President Biden on behalf of the American people. Blinken, who built his career as a Washington foreign policy hand with aggressive advocacy for intervention in defense of liberal democracy and human rights, is trying to restrain Middle East powers without the star power of many of his predecessors. In that way, he is reflective of a Biden Cabinet that departed from the high-profile Team of Rivals approach that President Barack Obama took in filling the top ranks of his administration with an all-star cast that included Biden, Hillary Clinton and several former governors. If Blinken has been the consummate Washington staffer, he is also something of the ideal Biden aide -- personally close to the boss, an expert in his field and unlikely to outshine the president. Unflappable and urbane, Blinken came to office with neither the medal-bedecked uniform of retired Gen. Colin Powell nor the international acclaim -- and presidential ambitions -- of Clinton. That can be a double-edged sword as he negotiates with foreign leaders who expect high-level attention from the YOU.S. and also value knowing that the secretary speaks to and for the president. Chollet said that he did not know whose idea it was for Biden to accept Netanyahu's invitation for a presidential visit, but that the secretary of state was the key player in laying the groundwork. Blinken's voice, from my perspective, was the most important because he was out here with everyone. He was on point, said Chollet, who is traveling with Blinken. He was able to get that fingertip feel of how it would land in Israel if the president visited, Chollet added. Daleep Singh, a former deputy national security adviser in the Biden White House, praised Blinken for executing a tough balancing act, noting the value his presence brings in prodding Israel to demonstrate restraint. Time is certainly your friend if you are trying to help a country think through the strategic implications of the day after -- every day allows for more thought to be put into a response, Singh said. Also, with him on the ground and the president on the way, it just increases the odds that Israel is not going to do anything that does not have alignment with the YOU.S. Foreign leaders can be sure there is little daylight between Biden and Blinken, who has no apparent agenda or aspiration for higher office, but there is also little public cost for slighting an official who does not have the global profile of some of his predecessors. Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly kept Blinken waiting overnight for a meeting in Riyadh this weekend. On Sunday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi noted that Blinken had spoken to Israelis earlier in the week as a Jew and claimed -- incorrectly and in front of Blinken -- that his own country had never persecuted Jews. I come first and foremost as a human being, a human being like so many others appalled at the atrocities committed by Hamas, Blinken responded in an apparent effort to play down the tribal appeal he had made to Israelis. Now 61, Blinken began his career as the chief foreign policy speechwriter on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton. He later served as staff director when Biden was the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as Biden's national security adviser and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration, and as the top foreign policy adviser on Biden's 2020 campaign. Friends say that background helps Blinken navigate effectively with little fanfare. It is actually a pretty big advantage, said former New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, who worked closely with Blinken in the Clinton administration and has remained a friend as their careers have crossed paths repeatedly in the ensuing decades. This is not a guy who is chasing headlines or seeking credit or worried about what his next job is going to be, Malinowski said. He is driven, and I have seen this over the years, by a very intense and intensely personal sense of responsibility to save lives in these situations and uphold a set of principles that he believes are at the heart of American foreign policy -- which is often easier said than done, especially in the Middle East. Blinken has spoken publicly about his sense of personal responsibility, as he did during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2021. His grandfather fled anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia, and his step-father, Samuel Pisar, survived four years in Nazi concentration camps. On a death march at the tail end of the war, Pisar ran away and hid in the woods, Blinken told the senators. He emerged when he saw a tank decorated with a five-pointed YOU.S. Army star, falling to his knees in front of an African American soldier. Pisar knew just three words in English, and he said them: God Bless America. That is who we are, Blinken said to the Senate committee where he had once served as the top aide. That is what we represent to the world, however imperfectly, and what we can still be at our best. Blinken's work is a manifestation of that view of the YOU.S. as a force for good, according to friends. You cannot know Tony without knowing the extent to which that family history shapes who he is, said Susan Rice, a former YOU.S. ambassador to the YOU.N. and national security adviser who worked with Blinken in the Clinton administration. He is been able to bring a clarity and a moral urgency and empathy to this work and this mission that he is on, which I hope the world sees is really human and deeply felt, Rice said. People who have worked with Blinken say that he has a rare ability to remain calm in stressful situations while also displaying empathy for those in distress. That lends Blinken credibility with his counterparts. But Tom Nides, Biden's former ambassador to Israel and onetime Obama deputy secretary of State, said Blinken's demeanor can be deceiving. I have been in the room when he was very aggressive with Netanyahu when he felt he was not doing the right thing, Nides said. People get confused between his appropriate attire, his dark tie and his white shirt. They should not misjudge his ability to have a velvet hammer in his right hand. Over the years, Blinken's worldview has often put him in a camp of Democratic foreign policy thinkers who favor using the American military to stop humanitarian crises -- either through threat or action. Blinken has written that force can be a necessary adjunct to effective diplomacy. He believes the YOU.S. did too little in confronting Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. In 2003, he helped Biden think through President George W. Bush's request for authorization to go to war in Iraq. Though Biden preferred giving Bush more limited powers, he voted with the Republican president. For Biden and for a number of others who voted for the resolution, it was a vote for tough diplomacy, Blinken told The New York Times nearly two decades later. At times, his tendency to turn to military force has placed him at odds with Biden, such as when the Obama administration struck Libya. Biden opposed that mission, which Blinken backed. When Biden sought to pull the YOU.S. out of a two-decade war in Afghanistan in 2021, Blinken pushed back privately, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Though he defended the move publicly, Blinken had resisted sticking to a withdrawal timeline negotiated by then-President Donald Trump and argued for creating more leverage with American military force, this person said. Biden and Blinken are close enough that Blinken attended the wedding of Biden's granddaughter at the White House last year. Although he has a reserved, low-key manner in public, Blinken has staked out a more hawkish stance on Ukraine than some others in the administration, according to sources familiar with the matter. During the course of the war, he has argued for sending more advanced weapons to Ukraine and disagreed with the idea that the YOU.S. should hold off on some arms shipments to avoid provoking Russia, seeing that as merely playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy. Blinken has been instrumental in Biden's successful effort to rally the NATO alliance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His response to the war in Ukraine reflects his strong belief that America has a leading role to play in the world, and that it can only succeed by working with allies. At Foggy Bottom, Blinken -- whose father served as ambassador to Hungary -- has been a reassuring presence for State Department diplomats after the turmoil of the Trump presidency, which was often at war with the foreign service. The diplomatic corps suffered an exodus of senior figures and a decline in applications during the previous administration, but career foreign service officers say Blinken has helped restore things to a more even keel. Graham, a close Trump ally, praised Blinken for taking a hawkish approach on Ukraine and said it is a benefit to Biden to have a lower-profile diplomat running the State Department. This is literally Biden's alter ego and most trusted ally running the foreign policy shop, he said. It is a secretary of state who has no agenda other than that of the president and who has no ambitions other than serving the president. And when he speaks, people know he is speaking for the president. Right now, Blinken is talking to everyone in the Middle East -- from Egypt to Qatar and Israel to Saudi Arabia. Whether those discussions prevent a broader war -- or limit civilian casualties -- remains to be seen. It is too soon to talk about results, Malinowski said. But I think this is a moment where a lot of Americans are seeing just how hard Tony works and how effective he can be in a moment of crisis.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill this month that would have given grocery store workers who are laid off as a result of a merger or acquisition a week of severance pay for every year of their service. Advocates began pushing for the severance package since last fall, when Kroger and Albertsons announced plans for a massive merger. The 24.6 billion deal involving two of the largest grocery chains in the United States faces antitrust scrutiny but, if approved, it could happen in early 2024. In the Bay Area, Kroger operates Food 4 Less, Foods Co. and Ralph's, and Albertsons operates Albertsons and Safeway. The veto announced last week comes after the governor signed two other grocery worker protection bills.Newsom said he vetoed the bill -- Senate Bill 725 -- because other laws already protect these workers. He cited the state's Grocery Worker Retention law, which since 2016 has required companies that merge or buy another grocer to retain existing workers at least 90 days, and the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires companies with 100 or more workers to give them 60 days notice before mass layoffs. He also noted that affected workers could tap unemployment insurance. While the goal of limiting the disruptions caused by grocery mergers and acquisitions ... is laudable, existing law already provides protections for displaced workers, he said. The additional obligations in this bill are unduly prescriptive and overly burdensome. California could be among the states most affected by a Kroger and Albertsons merger. Kroger operates 233 stores under the Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co brands in California, and Albertsons operates 579 stores under the Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions names, according to a report by the Los Angeles research group, Economic Roundtable. Counting merger's costs In Los Angeles and Orange counties, 115 of 159 Albertsons stores are located within two miles of a Kroger store. The merger could result in 5,750 jobs lost in the Los Angeles region, according to the report. The union that represents many California grocery workers is raising alarms about the potential layoffs. The United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council said in a statement: A merger between these two companies could result in large-scale layoffs for workers, grocery stores closing down, particularly in food deserts and rural areas, increasing food costs, and a reduction in a variety of products, including seasonal, organic, and climate-friendly plant-based foods for consumers, The companies denied that, saying no frontline employees would lose their jobs, because the companies plan to sell hundreds of stores to CS Wholesale Grocers, which has agreed to maintain store jobs and bargaining agreements and may use the Albertsons name in California. Some grocery workers said they would feel more secure with legal protections. Judy Wood, a cake decorator at Albertsons who has worked in grocery stores for 36 years, said she feels let down by Newsom's veto. We were deemed essential workers during the pandemic and we stood behind our governor at that time, she said. We kept the food going to people if they needed it and we stood on those frontlines. We were subjected to COVID all the time. We were there for him during that time ... but he is not there for us now. Wood, 65, said she is nearing retirement and plans to leave California because living here is hard on her 21.02 hourly pay. 'Essential heroes' State Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, the Los Angeles Democrat who authored SB 725, said the governor's veto is disappointing. Without our bill, it leaves essential workers vulnerable to a potential merger, as a vast majority of these workers are already struggling to make ends meet for their families, she said. Hours before the veto, the United Food and Commercial Workers praised Newsom for signing two companion bills to strengthen protections of grocery store workers. Assembly Bill 853 will require grocery or drug store companies to notify the state attorney general 180 days before finalizing a proposed merger or acquisition, and to submit an impact analysis of the deal. The analysis would include effects on community food deserts, prices, the supply of experienced grocery workers, as well as unemployment, wages and benefits. Grocery workers have seen the effects of mergers and acquisitions in the industry -- from job loss to centers of their communities going dark, said Todd Walters, president, UFCW Local 135 in a statement. AB 853 will give California's decision makers the information needed to know just how proposed mergers in the grocery and drug-retail industries will affect their lives and can make an informed decision on the impact of mergers on our state. AB 647 will strengthen the state's existing Grocery Worker Retention Law, expanding its 90-day retention provision to include warehouse workers. And it includes stronger enforcement mechanisms, including giving grocers 33 days to resolve a violation before a worker can sue. Mark Ramos, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council, said he is grateful Newsom signed the two bills but worries the veto will mean displaced workers will not have enough money if the merger goes through. Noting that Newsom once called grocery workers essential heroes, he added, It makes me wonder, are heroes disposable?

She was spotted on Sunday but now snow has covered the area. A long-line operation could not retrieve her body, Iswari Paudel, managing director of Himalayan Guides Nepal, told AFP. Ms Oleneva was an experienced climber and had been part of a team that made the first ascent of a remote peak in Kyrgyzstan two years ago.

Whether it is through interactions with guests, or by offering his personal take on a story, Madeley is known to audiences for expressing himself in an unfiltered manner. Viewers are quick to share their thoughts on Madeley's most eyebrow-raising moments on social media. Here is a rundown of his most controversial moments so far. 'Appalling' discussions on Israel-Hamas war Madeley sparked intense backlash on social media on 17 October, when he asked a British-Palestinian Liberal Democrat MP if she had any indication of Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel before it unfolded. Hamas's shock attack on 7 October killed more than 1,300 Israelis, as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore vengeance on the militant group. Israel has retaliated with relentless airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas, killing more than 2,750 Palestinians as of Monday (16 October). The Lib-Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the escalating conflict in the Middle East. GMB viewers accused Madeley of appalling behaviour when he asked Moran: With your family connections in Gaza, did you have any indication of what was going to happen 10 days ago ... was there any word on the street? Moran appeared taken aback by Madeley's question before replying she was as surprised by the attack as anyone else. Audiences called for Madeley to apologise to Moran or be taken off-air, one day after he compared civilian deaths in Gaza to those in Nazi Germany. During a GMB episode on Monday, he asked his co-host Susanna Reid if it was fair to draw a parallel between the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, with those of German civilians during the Second World War. Not just the holocaust, but with what the allies, the British, the free French did when they invaded Europe in 1944 and defeated the Nazis by going into Germany and in doing so, by going into Germany, apart from the bombing campaigns that the RAF and the American airforce launched, lots of German civilians were killed, Madeley said. Comparing climate activists to paedophiles Madeley's most recent moment of controversy took place on 28 March during a conversation about the decision of a group of Britain's top lawyers to refuse to prosecute climate activists. If these people, these barristers and lawyers, have announced they will not prosecute - they simply will not even get started in a court of law - someone who has glued themselves to the road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest, are they still happy to defend, say, a paedophile? Madeley asked. Some viewers expressed their disdain for his comments online, with one writing: Note to Richard Madeley - if you do not have anything sensible to say please do not say anything. Madeley was passionate in his questioning of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) leader, and pressed Lynch on the timing of the strikes. Why could not you have put all these strikes in January? Madeley asked Lynch. Why do you have to target people at Christmas? You will be putting people out of business who run hotels, who run restaurants, who run bars, and retail. Well, we are not targeting Christmas, Lynch replied. It is not Christmas yet, Richard. I do not know when your Christmas starts, but mine starts on Christmas Eve. Viewers were less than impressed with Madeley's conduct in the conversation, with one online commenter tweeting: Richard Madeley needs to calm down and let other people speak. A lot of the public stand with the rail strikers and nurses etc. Shamima Begum and Hitler Youth comments During a discussion on whether former Isis bride Shamima Begum should be allowed to return to the country, Madeley went off on a tangent about the Second World War. Obviously, we had the Nuremberg trials after the war and we hanged quite a few Nazis and imprisoned a lot of others and we let them out eventually. But we did not go after the Hitler Youth as far as I am aware. We did not go after the Hitler Youth - we only went after adults who served in the Hitler regime. And that is something to reflect on, I think. Susanna Reid appeared to be baffled by her co-host's reflections, and it led to some viewers comparing him to Alan Partridge, Steve Coogan's bumbling broadcaster character. Debating with Dr Hilary about Covid lockdown restrictions In July 2021, Madeley clashed opinions with Dr Hilary Jones, a longtime contributor to the programme, over their differing views on lockdown restrictions. The GP claimed that the UK should take rising Covid-19 cases more seriously - as Australia was at the time - rather than abandoning restrictions altogether. However, Madeley opposed Dr Jones's caution, telling him: But we have the vaccine and Australia has not. When Hilary explained that vaccines did not provide 100 per cent protection, Madeley said that he was being misleading.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Madeley has been a co-anchor on Good Morning Britain since 2017.

A 19-year-old Sikh on a New York City bus was attacked in a suspected hate crime assault by an assailant who tried to remove his turban while saying, We do not wear that in this country, police say. The New York City Police Department said the incident unfolded Sunday morning aboard MTA shuttle bus 8810 in the area of 118 Street and Liberty Avenue in the borough of Queens.

Ford, who has been a part of UAW negotiations since 1982, pleaded with union members and leaders to work with the company, instead of against it, to reach a tentative deal to end to this acrimonious round of talks. Such comments by the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford are uncharacteristic during contract talks with the UAW. We are at a crossroads, Ford said during a news conference at the company's massive Rouge Complex in metro Detroit. Choosing the right path is not just about Ford's future and our ability to compete. This is about the future of the American automobile industry. Ford, ahead of speaking on stage, told reporters he wanted to elevate the conversation about the contract negotiations. Ford said he did not want to get personal in his remarks because it does not matter at this point. The UAW's leaders have called us the enemy in these negotiations. But I will never consider our employees as enemies. This should not be Ford versus the UAW, Ford said. It should be Ford and the UAW vs. Toyota and Honda, Tesla, and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home. UAW President Shawn Fain countered Ford's plea by ratcheting up the pressure. Bill Ford knows exactly how to settle this strike. Instead of threatening to close the Rouge, he should call up Ford CEO Jim Farley, tell him to stop playing games and get a deal done, or we will close the Rouge for him, he said in a statement. It is not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It is autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed. If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits. Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy -- they are the UAW members of the future. Ford did not threaten to close the Rouge Complex in his remarks. He did mention if American carmakers such as Ford lose to the competition, then jobs, future investments and factories like the one we are in today will be lost. Ford's remarks come after a week of contentious talks between the company and the UAW, including the union unexpectedly announcing a strike Wednesday night at the company's highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant. More than 19,000 of Ford's 57,000 UAW members are currently impacted by the strike, including more than 16,600 striking workers. Another roughly 2,480 employees have been laid off as a result of the work stoppage. Ford last week said it was at the limit of what it can offer the UAW in terms of economic concessions. The company's most recent proposal included 23 to 26 wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health-care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments; and other benefits. Overall, only about 34,000 YOU.S. autoworkers with the companies -- or roughly 23 of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers -- are currently on strike. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. Fain last week said the union has entered a new phase of the targeted strikes in which it would no longer pre-announce the work stoppages, as it had been. Fain has said it is ultimately up to the members to decide when the strike ends, not UAW leadership. Opinions of the strike and current contract proposals varied on picket lines Monday outside Ford's nearby Michigan Assembly Plant, which was the first of three facilities to go on strike last month. I trust Shawn Fain, said Latosha Smith, a four-year worker at the plant. All the steps he is taken, it is for the because. Tamika Genus, a worker at the plant for roughly five years, said of course she would like it to come to a resolution, but it is worth it. She later added, We are doing what we have got to do. Jeff Nichol, a body shop worker at the plant who was laid off due to the strike, said he wishes that the sides would come to a conclusion a lot sooner than later. He also would like union leaders to be more transparent regarding exact details of the company's proposals. Nichol, who is been autoworker for over 11 years, said he knows it is an unpopular opinion, but he would support Ford's current proposal, including a 23 wage increase. What I have been getting is good enough, so any little bit of extra does help, especially with the current economy, he said. The way I look at it, too, is the amount of time that we are off, that also plays into how long it is going to take for us to make a difference for the amount of money that we lose every single week. Ford said Friday employees who have been on strike since Sept. 15 have on average lost about 4,000 in pretax income through four weeks of the strike.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Ford Motor Executive Chair Bill Ford urges UAW to work with company, not against it.

The military said its forces had carried out well-aimed strikes on enemy airfields near the eastern city of Luhansk and the southern city of Berdiansk but gave few details. It did not comment on media reports that Kyiv had used YOU.S.-provided ATACMS long-range missiles for the first time in the attacks. Ukrainian Special Forces said nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher and other equipment had been destroyed, runways had been hit, and heavy losses had been inflicted on Russian forces. Russia's Defence Ministry did not mention the attacks. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region which is partly controlled by Moscow, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defences had ensured the attack on the Berdiansk airfield was not successful. But a number of Russian military bloggers reported the attacks, and the Russian Telegram channel Fighterbomber said Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv and the Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS at Russian forces for the first time on Tuesday. Kyiv has been seeking the missiles to enhance its ability to attack supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory but has not confirmed receiving them. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made no direct mention of the overnight attacks but said after meeting military chiefs: Thanks also to those who powerfully destroy the logistics and bases of the occupiers on our land. There are results. I thank some of our partners: effective weapons, as we agreed, he said. UKRAINIAN COUNTEROFFENSIVE Since starting a counteroffensive in early June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in areas Russian forces occupy in Ukraine. The counteroffensive has made only gradual gains through vast Russian minefields and heavily entrenched Russian positions, and Kyiv says Moscow is attacking in some areas ahead of the second winter since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter, and that fighting continued around the town of Avdiivka on the eastern front. Kyiv says its forces are holding their ground, including around Avdiivka and Kupiansk. The Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, said in its latest report on the conflict that Moscow had made only limited gains in the area around Avdiivka and that the pace of its advance there had slowed.

The Minnesota candy-man was having limited success with his Mar-O-Bar. The chocolate-coated whipped cream confection was too fragile to travel far and looked destined to join previous failures. As he sat with his son Forrest at a Minneapolis diner, the younger Mars had an idea that would change their lives -- and candy -- forever: Why not make a candy bar version of a malted milkshake? One hundred years ago, in 1923, the first Milky Way bar was made and sold in Minneapolis. Within a year, sales reached 800,000 -- the equivalent of more than 14 million in today's dollars. Not bad for a 5-cent candy bar -- which, to be clear, was named after the popular milkshakes of the time, not the galaxy. People are also reading...

The success of the Minnesota-born Milky Way would lead to other long-lasting hits such as Snickers, Three Musketeers and MM's, making the Mars family billionaires in the process. Today Mars is the fourth-largest private company in the YOU.S. with annual revenue of more than 45 billion, according to Forbes. We hold Milky Way in high esteem, said Anton Vincent, CEO of Mars Wrigley North America. The people that preceded me many years ago had an eye on the future and ensured that we had a place in people's lives. Who would-a thought it? The Milky Way went into full production in 1924. It is a nougat bar, which made him very different from the competition, layered with caramel then enrobed in chocolate, Borghesani said. That mechanical enrobing was key to the Milky Way's success -- it coated the sides of the bar evenly and advanced the industry beyond time-consuming hand-dipped chocolates. Similarly, it was a technological breakthrough that gave Milton Hershey the ability to scale his dreams into the first national chocolate empire decades earlier. Hershey would become a key chocolate supplier for Mars before the companies became bitter rivals, in part due to the success of the Milky Way and the threat it posed to Hershey bars. Mars dispatched sales teams to cities around the country -- a 1925 Minneapolis Journal ad sought detail men to sell Milky Ways. Lima will be campaigned this week by a crew of eight young men advertising the famous Milky Way candy bar, the News and Times-Democrat of Lima, Ohio, reported in 1925. By the end of the decade, sales had grown to 26 million -- almost half a billion in today's dollars -- and the dark chocolate and vanilla nougat bar that would become Milky Way Midnight was seeing early success. Having outgrown the Minneapolis warehouse, Mars Inc. built a factory in Chicago and moved its headquarters there in 1929. The company, now based in Virginia, announced just last year it would be closing that Chicago plant. 'I had an empire in my mind' Frank and Forrest Mars had a rocky relationship, and Forrest's ambition far outshone his father's. My father says, 'We are making enough money.' ... I had empire in my mind, Forrest Mars said in a family archive videotape, according to Jol Glenn Brenner's 1998 book The Emperors of Chocolate, which recounted the stories of the private Mars and Hershey families in unprecedented detail. Frank Mars gave his son 50,000 and the foreign rights to Milky Way in 1932, Brenner reported. Forrest then moved to London and introduced the Mars Bar -- essentially the Milky Way under a different name -- which still sells well in Europe today. After introducing Snickers and Three Musketeers bars during the company's first few years in Chicago, Frank Mars died in Baltimore in 1934, where he had gone to seek treatment for an illness. Forrest Mars eventually returned to the YOU.S. and ran Mars for decades, introducing MM's in 1941 and growing the company through pet food brands like Pedigree and Iams. He died in 1999, at the age of 95. His heirs still own the company. Vincent attributes the Milky Way's success to a century of strong relationships with consumers. There is a universal truth around what chocolate is and how it fits into people's lives. It is broadly appealing, Vincent said. Frank was a natural advertiser, and we have kept that tradition strong. ... I am responsible for the next 100 years. As Halloween approaches and candy bags fill with century-old brands, the cycle of nostalgia will continue. Consumers try it and like it and pass it down generation to generation, company historian Borghesani said.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Biden will visit Tel Aviv before going to Jordan where he will meet with King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The White House said Biden will reiterate that the militant group Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination, and discuss the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza. '(The) president will hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimizes civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas,' YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken also said his talks with Netanyahu yielded a possible breakthrough in getting humanitarian assistance to besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returns to Amman, Jordan, early October 17, 2023, after over seven hours of negotiations that went overnight with officials including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Today, and at our request, the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza - and them alone -- including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way, Blinken said in a brief statement to reporters. He said it is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible, but expressed concern that Hamas militants may try to seize supplies or prevent their distribution. Grave humanitarian crisis Palestinians in Gaza have been without electricity and under a complete Israeli siege with no food, fuel or water allowed into the Hamas-controlled territory since October 9. Israel says it imposed the blockade in response to the deadly terrorist attack Hamas launched on Israeli towns on October 7, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis. Nearly 200 others were taken hostage by the terror group. Israel has amassed 300,000 troops on Gaza's border, poised for a likely ground invasion, as it vows to wipe out Hamas. Israeli forces have been hitting Gaza with airstrikes since the Hamas attack, killing more than 2,800 people and wounding at least another 10,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have heeded Israel's orders to evacuate northern Gaza for the southern half of the Strip ahead of the expected offensive. There continues to be no water for the vast majority of the population in Gaza, said Juliette Touma, spokesperson for the YOU.N. agency that assists Palestinians, UNRWA. We are talking about 2 million people in the Gaza Strip who do not have water, and water is running out, and water is life, and life is running out of Gaza, Touma said. UNRWA said Monday that there are not enough body bags for the dead in Gaza. Embed share Israeli volunteers look for civilians, including babies and the elderly, taken hostage by Hamas Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Touma said an estimated 1 million Palestinians have fled toward the south and nearly 400,000 of them are sheltering mostly in UNRWA schools. One group is being housed in an UNRWA warehouse, which Touma said is not equipped to be a shelter. UNRWA has deployed an advance team to Egypt to prepare for the possible opening of a humanitarian corridor to bring aid supplies into Gaza. The United Nations said humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths will head to Egypt on Tuesday for several days. He also plans to visit Israel. At the United Nations, the Security Council voted late Monday on a Russian-drafted resolution seeking a humanitarian cease-fire and the release of all Israeli and foreign hostages. The measure, which Russia did not negotiate with council members, failed to receive the necessary support. Only five of the 15 council members supported the measure, four voted against it and six abstained. The United States was among those who did not support it. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said civilians should not have to suffer for Hamas' atrocities, but said the proposed text failed to condemn the terror group. By failing to condemn Hamas, Russia is giving cover to a terrorist group that brutalizes innocent civilians, she said. It is outrageous, it is hypocritical, and it is indefensible.

The Israeli Air Force said Tuesday it struck Hezbollah terror targets and military infrastructure in Lebanon in response to militant fire toward Israel. Speaking to the Israeli Knesset Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah, 'Do not test us in the north. Do not make the mistake of the past. Today, the price you will pay will be far heavier,' he said, referring to Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. The United Nations has a peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon that monitors the border with Israel. It said Monday that its headquarters in the Lebanese town of Naqoura was hit, but no one was injured. A spokesperson said the YOU.N. is investigating to see who fired at the facility.

While a threatened Israeli ground invasion has not yet begun, not even a temporary ceasefire appears to be anywhere on the horizon. A UN Security Council resolution drafted by Russia calling for an immediate ceasefire the and release of captives held in Gaza was voted down on Monday. A vote on a draft resolution from Brazil that, unlike the Russian text, specifically condemns Hamas, has been delayed until late Tuesday. In the meantime, Gaza's morgues and hospitals continue to overflow with casualties. The Gaza health ministry recorded 108 Palestinian fatalities over the past 24 hours as of 6pm local time on Monday, bringing the death toll in the territory since 7 October to 2,778 people. More than 1,000 of those killed were children, accounting for more than a third of the fatalities. Forty-seven Palestinian families have been killed and wiped from the civil registry, according to the health ministry. Hundreds of people are missing and believed to be trapped under the rubble, according to the UN. Mohammad Abu Rukbah, a field researcher for the children's rights group in Gaza, said that the psychological repercussions of Israel's war will be catastrophic. Witnessing the deaths of other children compounds their distress, leaving indelible scars on their mental well-being, Defense for Children International-Palestine added. Entire families are being wiped out in the blink of an eye, shattering the very foundations of these households. Children have been left orphaned and will now grapple not only with the pain of the current situation in their city but also with the daunting challenge of navigating life without the foundational support of their families. Hospitals are about to run out of fuel to power generators, endangering the lives of thousands of patients, according to the UN. Meanwhile, there is an imminent risk of death or infectious disease outbreak with the collapse of virtually all water and sanitation services in Gaza. As many as one million people - around half the population of Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas on the planet - are internally displaced, with many people moving from northern Gaza to the south after Israel ordered its evacuation ahead of a threatened ground invasion. More than 50 Palestinians, including 16 children, have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Monday that at least 15 journalists were among the more than 4,000 dead on both sides since the war began on 7 October. The press freedom watchdog said that freelance journalist Salam Mema is among the 11 Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza during that period. Her body was recovered from the rubble three days after her home was hit in an Israeli airstrike in Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza on 10 October. Mema held the position of head of the Women Journalists Committee at the Palestinian Media Assembly, an organization committed to advancing media work for Palestinian journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists said. The New York-based group said that three Israeli journalists were killed on 7 October: Shai Regev, an editor for Maariv; Ayelet Arnin, a news editor with Israel's public broadcaster; and Yaniv Zohar, a photojournalist for Israel Hayom, who was killed along with his wife and two daughters. Issam Abdallah, a videographer for Reuters, was killed when Israeli shelling targeted a group of journalists marked as press near the Lebanese border on 13 October. Israel says that 1,300 people were killed in the 7 October surprise attack led by the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. However, evidence is emerging that a significant number died not at the hands of Palestinians, but from Israeli police and military fire. Israel says that 199 people were captured and taken into Gaza on 7 October, though Hamas officials gave higher figures on Monday. Israel says that it is holding the bodies of 1,500 Palestinian fighters killed during the 7 October attack. An unknown number of those who Israel claims were militants may have actually been unarmed civilians from Gaza. Israel said on Monday that military forensic teams examining the bodies of people killed in the 7 October attack found multiple signs of torture, rape and other atrocities. Israeli military officers repeated thus far unsubstantiated claims that children were beheaded. In its report on the new claims on Monday, Reuters said the military personnel overseeing the identification process did not present any forensic evidence in the form of pictures or medical records. While serious abuses surely did occur during the 7 October attack, sensational claims made by the Israeli military on Monday may be another attempt to justify atrocity crimes in Gaza. Shawan Jabarin, the director of the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, called for an international independent investigation on Monday. Speaking from Ramallah, Jabarin condemned the EU and US for facilitating Israel's aggression on the civilian population in Gaza, which he said reached the threshold for the crime of genocide. Jabarin urged third states to pressure Israel to allow the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry to enter and investigate all crimes committed regardless of the perpetrators. Israel continued to target residential buildings in its nonstop bombardment of Gaza between late Sunday and Monday. The UN said that 10 Palestinians were killed in a strike targeting a residential building in Jabaliya; at least 11 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed in the Musabah area of Rafah in Gaza's south; and 11 Palestinians were killed when a charity organization's building was hit in Rafah. On Monday morning, 22 Palestinians were killed when Israel targeted a residential building in Khan Younis. The UN said that several attacks occurred in close proximity to a hospital and main roads, creating significant access challenges. Palestinians are meanwhile rationing whatever food, water and cooking gas they still have. He warned of additional casualties if hospitals, which are being powered by emergency generators, run out of fuel. Meanwhile, 2,500 people were sheltering at al-Shifa hospital, the largest health facility in Gaza. This is an urgent appeal. Please, if you are a human ... please stop this. Save Gaza, please support Gaza. On Monday, UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, denied reports that one of its Gaza warehouses had been looted. Israeli media reported that UNRWA had tweeted that fuel and medical equipment had been removed by the Gaza health ministry without authorization before deleting the tweets. In an urgent clarification, UNRWA said that the images circulating on social media showed a routine transfer of medical supplies to its health partners. Meanwhile, footage showed an UNRWA warehouse that was said to have been hit in an Israeli strike overnight Sunday: Water cannot be pumped and distributed without electricity and damage to water infrastructure from Israeli bombardment will make it difficult to access water even if the electricity and fuel is restored, Gisha said. The group noted that the last of Gaza's water desalination facilities shut down yesterday for lack of electricity. Israeli warplanes bombed Rafah crossing along the Egypt-Gaza boundary for the fourth time while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was meeting with Israel's emergency cabinet in Tel Aviv on Monday. On Sunday, Blinken said that an agreement had been reached to open Rafah crossing on Monday morning to let foreign passport-holders out of Gaza and let desperately needed humanitarian aid into the territory. The Egyptian group Sinai for Human Rights said on Monday that Israel targeted the barriers on the Egyptian side. Those barriers were put there by Egypt last week to prevent a feared mass exodus of Palestinians from Gaza to the Sinai. Giora Eiland, a reservist major general, stated that creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the goal. Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist, he added. Israel announced on Monday that residents of 28 settlements in close proximity to the border with Lebanon would be evacuated. Cross-border fire between the Israeli military and Hizballah in Lebanon have raised fears of a regional escalation. Some two dozen communities in the south of Israel near the Gaza boundary have already been evacuated, including the city of Sderot. A large proportion of Ashkelon's residents have also reportedly left, the UN said. Meanwhile, the Biden administration in Washington was deploying more offensive forces into the Middle East, to back Israel and attempt to deter Iran and Hizballah from opening a second front on Israel's north, the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz reported on Monday. CNN meanwhile reported that the US was sending 2,000 Marines and sailors to join the warships it has already sent to the eastern Mediterranean. The Biden administration has put on a big show of seemingly unconditional solidarity for Israel and has demonized Palestinians and parroted Israeli propaganda to manufacture consent for the genocidal campaign underway in Gaza. Gallant said that this will be a long war; the price will be high. But we are going to win for Israel and the Jewish people, and for the values that both countries believe in. US President Joe Biden is traveling to Israel to make a display of support on Wednesday. But behind the scenes, US officials are reportedly pressing Israel to determine an endgame. The Biden administration is surely aware that the situation could rapidly escalate and embroil the United States in a broader regional war that will cost more American lives, as Sam Heller and Thanassis Cambanis state in an analysis for The Century Foundation. Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said on Monday that more than 200 people captured in the 7 October attack are being held in Gaza. He said that Hamas was holding 200 of the captives and that as many as 50 additional captives were being held by other factions. Islamic Jihad has previously said that it is holding 30 captives. He said that the captives were being treated humanely and that they eat what we eat, and they drink what we drink. Israeli airstrikes had killed 22 captives, Abu Obeida said, most recently a 26-year-old artist from Tel Aviv. He said that foreign nationals being held captive in Gaza are our guests and that they would be protected and released when circumstances allow. But the Qassam spokesperson said that foreign nationals who had joined the Israeli army to fight against the Palestinian people would be treated like Israeli soldiers regardless of any other nationality they hold. The Qassam Brigades also released its first video of one of the captives. The video shows a woman who identifies herself as Maya Sham and who says in Hebrew that she was captured in the Sderot area. The video shows Sham being treated for an injury to her hand. They have been taking care of me, providing medication, she says and asks please get me out of here as quickly as possible. Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas' diaspora office, said in a lengthy interview with AlAraby TV on Monday that the captives include high-ranking officers from the Israeli military's Gaza Division. He said that the resistance has enough captives to free all 6,000 Palestinians being held in Israeli jails and prisons. Both Meshaal and Abu Obeida reaffirmed that Palestinians in Gaza would not be uprooted. The Qassam spokesperson said that a threatened ground invasion does not intimidate us and would provide the resistance with an opportunity to punish the enemy for its crimes. Meshaal said that an expulsion of Palestinians to Egypt was not only contrary to the interests of that country, but also to Jordan, implying that an ethnic cleansing of the West Bank would come next. Meshaal indicated that resistance was now the only path to liberation since all attempts at a peace process have failed for decades. He expressed confidence that Israel's vows to destroy Hamas would fail, asserting that it had tried numerous times to destroy the resistance and had emerged defeated. Underlining that Hamas did not stand alone, he said that Hizballah thankfully took steps since the current confrontation began, but said that the battle requires more. That may soon come, as Iran's foreign minister said on Monday that preventive action by the resistance axis may happen in a matter of hours. Echoing the UN secretary-general, the world body's humanitarian aid chief Martin Griffiths called on Monday for the immediate release of Israelis and foreign nationals being held in Gaza. The International Committee of the Red Cross told Israeli media that it was speaking directly with senior Hamas officials to demand access to Israeli hostages, The Times of Israel reported. Israeli media, citing foreign diplomatic sources, reported on Monday that talks have been underway to secure the release of some of the captive. The Israeli military says that 199 civilians and soldiers captured on 7 October are being held in Gaza. The Israeli government has prioritized exacting revenge in Gaza and reestablishing deterrence over the release of the captives, saying that negotiations would take place only after the war. Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to have crashed a meeting between the prime minister and families whose relatives are being held in Gaza. Netanyahu has come under fierce criticism in Israel for not taking responsibility for the government's failure to prevent the 7 October attack. He did not meet with the families of captives held in Gaza for more than a week. Representatives of five families were present at the meeting that was coordinated with the prime minister's office at short notice. According to Israeli media, members of a family unknown to the organization representing the families of captives and missing persons joined the meeting. One of the members of the family unknown to the organization that coordinated the meeting said that he loves his daughter as much as the others love their family members. But at the end we have to look at the people of Israel and the future of our existence here - suggesting that he would rather that Israel pound Gaza than negotiate the release of the captives. An Israeli journalist whose family members were being held in Gaza accused Netanyahu of deliberately drawing divisions between the families of captives. Netanyahu's office denied planting people in the meeting. Meanwhile, parents of Israelis being held in Gaza who are camped outside of the Israeli defense ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, demanding that Netanyahu prioritize their release, are being attacked and threatened by Israelis who want to see the continued annihilation of Gaza. The father of a captive was even told I hope your daughter dies by an apparently right-wing activist, according to Israeli media reports.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israel's bombardment by air, sea and land against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza continued almost uninterrupted for a 10th day on Monday.

Residents of the city spent half the night listening to the wonderful 'tracks' of the impacts and detonation of ammunition. Later, the Ukrainian army's General Staff reported that the strikes destroyed two Russian helicopters, an ammunition warehouse, and an artillery system. What we know about situation in occupied Luhansk and Berdiansk The southern city of Berdiansk, Zaporizhzhia region, has been under Russian occupation since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. Now, explosions are being heard more and more often in Berdiansk, mainly near the local airfield. After the start of the full-scale war, the Russian occupiers used it to deploy their units and base helicopters. In mid-August, occupied Berdiansk was rocked by an explosion near the port. In late June, a series of explosions happened in the city, with more than ten strikes on the Russian troops and equipment. Recently, there have also been more and more explosions in Luhansk, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. In late September, the impact destroyed the Russian ammunition warehouse at the Yunist radio equipment and radio electronics factory. In mid-June, sounds similar to explosions were heard in the occupied Yuvileine, Luhansk region. Then, the Ukrainian armed forces released a video of the damage to the Russian missile arsenal in the Luhansk region. Luhansk hosts a large number of Russian occupiers.

This is significant not only because it would make the NNPC Ltd the first state-owned national company to sign onto the global initiative, it is committing to sustainable, socially responsible business practices, something the national oil company is not always reputed for. It could also signal, that the corporation, long accused of being opaque may now be ready to turn the corner. Launched in 2000, The United Nations Global Compact is a non-binding United Nations pact to get businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies and to report on their implementation. Under the Global Compact, companies are brought together with UN agencies, labour groups and civil society. Its founding principles are Human Rights -Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour: Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

Nwokolo - Executive Director, UN Global Compact Nigeria Environment: Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti-Corruption: Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Through these principles, it seeks to catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It seeks commitments to specific sustainability and social responsibility goals from CEOs and highest-level executives, and in turn, offers training, peer networks and a functional framework for responsibility. Why it matters In her remarks shortly after signing on behalf of the UN Global Compact, Naomi Nwokolo, the Executive Director, UN Global Compact Network Nigeria, described NNPC Ltd.'s move to become a participant of the UN Global Compact as a pivotal step in fostering a culture of ethical business conduct, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. This strategic alliance provides NNPC Ltd. with an invaluable platform to showcase best practices, engage in collective sustainability initiatives, and contribute substantially to the attainment of the 2030 Agenda. The event will catalyse the adoption of best practices throughout the Nigerian energy sector, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and environmental stewardship.

Nigeria is one of the largest producers of crude oil in Africa, a transition from an energy system driven by fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy will have a far-reaching impact on the economy. In the interim, the disposition of the current president and in fact, his policies have been geared towards more drilling, this could conflict with the stated goals of shift towards cleaner energy. By joining the pact, the NNPC Ltd is pledging an unwavering commitment. This momentous development holds profound significance, signifying a substantial leap towards the promotion of sustainable development and ethical business practices within Nigeria's oil and gas sector, the UN Global Compact said in its release. The quiet part about this pact is that companies also committed themselves to ethical business practices. For a company like the NNPC Ltd which has often been abused by successive governments to serve as a patronage system for politicians or other interests, it calls for better business practices. In the very least, the corporation will actively collaborate with a global community of more than 15,000 like-minded enterprises and over 4,000 non-business entities to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within Nigeria. In 2022, the corporation imported petrol with high sulphur content and there are legitimate concerns that its refineries are not being retooled to produce cleaner fuels.

Nicole Fahey is pictured getting a Covid booster shot in Los Angeles on November 3, 2021. Gary Coronado  Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file As the winter respiratory illness season fast approaches, this is the first year that four vaccines are being recommended during pregnancy. Yet, there are already signs that fewer pregnant women are getting vaccinated -- putting themselves and their newborns at increased risk of severe illness or death. We are meeting more resistance than I ever remember, said Dr. Neil Silverman, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UCLA Health. We did not get this kind of pushback on this scale before the pandemic. Now all vaccines are lumped together as 'bad,' he said. In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended for the first time that pregnant people get the RSV vaccine to protect against an infection that is usually mild in healthy adults but can be dangerous for children younger than 5. The new guidance means pregnant women will be encouraged to get four vaccines to protect against the flu, Covid and pertussis (also called whooping cough), as well as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. However, a recent CDC report found growing doubts about vaccination during pregnancy. Among almost 2,000 women who were pregnant during the height of last year's cold and flu season or when the survey was conducted in March and April, almost a quarter said they were very hesitant about getting a flu shot. That is a significant increase over the 17.2 who said they had the same level of reservations during the 2021-2022 respiratory illness season. That reluctance has translated to fewer pregnant women protected against influenza and other illnesses. Even prior to the pandemic, it was a struggle to get pregnant women vaccinated, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, vice president for medical affairs at the University of Iowa Health Care, as well as a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Since then, skepticism about vaccines has ballooned and spread to common flu shots that have been given to millions of pregnant women over several decades without any evidence of problematic side effects. Last year, the CDC study found, 47.2 of expectant mothers got their flu shots, down from 57.5 who got their flu shots during the pre-Covid 2019-20 season. Just more than half, or 55.4, got their Tdap vaccines and only 27.3 of women got the Covid booster before or during pregnancy last season, when omicron infections were filling hospitals. The Tdap vaccine protects newborns against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis and has been recommended during pregnancy since 2011. Tdap is just barely recovering from pre-pandemic levels, Jamieson said. The number of women vaccinated for Covid is disappointing. According to Dr. Linda Eckert, an OB-GYN and global health and immunization expert at the University of Washington, there is a bias that some patients have, more than they used to, about how they feel about a vaccine. When Eckert recommends a vaccine to her pregnant patients, more now react with, I am not going to talk about it, she said. Pregnant women are primed to question everything they put in their body, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. That instinct is a good one. It is protective mothering, said Dr. Jodie Dionne, associate director of Global Health in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for Women's Reproductive Health. We actually want women to question what they are putting in their body. There are a lot of myths out there, what I would call blatant disinformation that is intended to be more politically charged, not based in science, said Dr. Melissa Simon, an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The only way doctors can address those concerns effectively, Dionne said, is to create an open atmosphere where they feel comfortable telling you what they are worried about. A key finding in the CDC report is that when obstetricians or providers talked to women about the need for vaccination, they were less hesitant. A lot more people are vaccine hesitant than anti-vaccine, Eckert said. Vaccine hesitant individuals tend to be curious. Doctors perfected their skills addressing patients' vaccine concerns when Covid shots became crucial, said Dr. Sarah Pachtman, a maternalfetal physician at Northwell Health's Katz Women's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York. We have had so much practice, she said, adding that she is encountered less vaccine hesitancy this year compared to before the pandemic. I noticed myself spending more time counseling patients, she said. That helps decrease their hesitancy. During pregnancy, the belly enlarges, pushing up against the diaphragm, decreasing lung capacity. That makes pregnant women -- especially those late in their pregnancies -- more vulnerable to breathing difficulties, Simon said. When an infection like RSV or Covid or influenza gets into that lung space, it is even harder for people who are pregnant to breathe, she said. Pregnant women are one of the most at-risk groups for flu complications. Covid can also be harmful during pregnancy, and can increase the risk of preterm births and other complications. The virus almost killed Haeli Graham of Swansboro, North Carolina, and caused her son to be born three months early. On July 4, 2021, Graham, then 27 years old and six months pregnant, went to the emergency room, gasping for air, she said. I could not breathe and I could not feel my baby moving anymore, she said. A Covid test came back positive. Within days, her lungs collapsed and she developed two pulmonary embolisms. She was intubated and put into a medically induced coma to give her lungs time to heal. Graham had no idea that doctors had to deliver her baby early until she woke up more than a month later. I was speechless, she said. It was just shocking that me -- a very healthy, active 27-year-old female -- could have died. Her son, Colton, was born at just 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Despite some delays, he is now a healthy 2 year old. Though Covid vaccines were available by summer 2021, Graham's doctor at the time advised her against getting the shot, citing a lack of evidence about their safety. It was a very scary time, Graham said. We had no idea what to do. It was not until August 2021, a month after she had been hospitalized with Covid, that the CDC said it had gathered enough evidence to recommend the shots for pregnant people. Now is the time for flu, as well as Covid shots -- just ahead of the typical winter respiratory virus season, experts say. Those shots can be given at any stage of pregnancy, according to the CDC. Timing for the two other recommended shots is more specific and should be given during the third trimester. The Tdap vaccine is given between the 27th and 36th weeks of gestation, ideally during the earlier part of that timeline. That timing helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth, the CDC says on its website. That is especially important when it comes to protecting against whooping cough. Babies are not eligible for the shots themselves until they are several months old. Babies who catch whooping cough, especially those younger than 3 months old, are most likely to have serious problems, have to be cared for in a hospital, and possibly even die, Tami Skoff, a CDC epidemiologist, wrote in an email. Vaccinating women during every pregnancy is critical for providing the best protection to the youngest of babies. A CDC study published in February found that the number of babies 2 months and younger who developed whooping cough was significantly lower after the vaccines were recommended. The vaccine is given during each subsequent pregnancy because those antibodies decrease in the mother's body over time. The single-dose RSV shot from Pfizer is recommended between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. It was found to lower the risk of severe RSV among infants by 91 within the first three months after birth, a time when babies are especially vulnerable. Last winter, a surge of RSV among young children overwhelmed hospitals. Doctors insist there is no danger in vaccinations during pregnancy. We have been vaccinating pregnant people for decades, Silverman said. While any vaccine for any person, pregnant or not, can have a rare side effect, those serious side effects are exceedingly low. And none of these vaccines have ever been shown to have any negative impact on the fetus or newborn. Vaccines are a very efficient way to protect mothers and to protect their babies in one fell swoop, he said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Pregnant women have a higher risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses like the flu and Covid.

In 2019, the DRC created Entreprise Gnrale du Cobalt (EGC), which holds a monopoly on the purchase and sale of artisanal cobalt, in order to improve the working conditions of artisanal miners, known as creuseurs. Since then, the state-owned company has remained largely inactive. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people are working in disastrous conditions in informal cobalt mines in the DRC, the world's largest producer of this mineral essential for the manufacture of electric batteries, against a backdrop of accusations of child labour and corruption. Speaking on the sidelines of a cobalt workshop in Kinshasa, EGC's managing director told AFP that the company was studying eight pilot sites from which it could soon start sourcing. These sites are located on concessions belonging to state-owned Congolese mining company Gcamines, in Lualaba and Haut-Katanga, two provinces in the south-east of the country. We are in the process of analysing the mineralisation to ensure that we can use them as pilot sites, explained Eric Kalala. Confirmation of the designation of these sites is expected within the next few weeks, he added, explaining that the EGC would then endeavour to control access to the mines, distribute protective equipment and launch an ore traceability programme. This is a first step, he said. According to EGC officials present at Thursday's meeting, the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and delays in setting up a market regulator have contributed to the difficulties in getting the company off the ground. Speaking before the meeting, mining activist Franck Fwamba accused politicians with interests in the informal cobalt mines. He also referred to the supposed hostility of the Minister of Mines, Antoinette N'Samba, towards EGC and its monopoly, which she considered illegal.

Instead, they have evolved a repertoire of biological and behavioural techniques to resist undesirable advances, from expressing disinterest through body language to physically rejecting unwanted suitors. In some cases, however, they must get rather inventive. A new study, led by Carolin Dittrich and Mark-Oliver Rdel from the Museum fr Naturkunde in Berlin, delves into two such exceptional instances of creative rejection tactics exhibited by female common frogs. In the world of amphibians, particularly frogs and toads, romance is a high-stakes, high-speed affair. These creatures are known for their explosive breeding seasons, characterised by a brief and intense reproductive period that typically spans a few days to a few weeks. During this window, hundreds to thousands of frogs congregate at breeding sites. But here is the catch: female frogs often need to mature before they can reproduce, and they do not breed every year. As a result, males significantly outnumber females, leading to fierce competition among the males, who passionately latch onto anything that moves. Should a male mistakenly grab another male, a peculiar release call is used to signal the blunder to the fellow in error. It was previously thought that female frogs within these breeding aggregations were largely defenceless against male coercion. In the chaotic environment of amphibian amorousness, it is not unusual for numerous males to cling to a single female, forming a perilous mating ball that often results in the female's demise. Amidst this tumult, female frogs have developed peculiar behaviours as a means to escape the relentless pursuit of males. The most common tactic employed by these females is to rotate on their axis, effectively dodging the advances of eager suitors. But Dittrich and Rdel's research reveals that female frogs have more tricks up their proverbial sleeves to elude the tenacious males. In one of nature's more unconventional strategies, female frogs have been observed imitating the calls of males, producing a deeper, lower-frequency grunt that emulates the male's release call, effectively tricking their persistent paramours into releasing them. Elaborating on this behaviour, Dittrich said: Tonic immobility in the context of mating is exceptional and very rarely observed. I know of only a few studies that have found tonic immobility associated with mating, for example in spiders or dragonflies. It is generally assumed that this strategy is used as a last resort to avoid predation. Rdel adds: We, therefore, suspect that this defensive behaviour has evolved to protect the female from the formation of 'mating balls,' which can often lead to the death of the female. Calling allows females to show that they are not ready to mate, and if this is of no use, stressed females can fall into tonic immobility. The findings leave one pondering the intricate dance of nature, where even the most ordinary and well-studied species can spring forth surprises as captivating and imaginative as any tale of love in the human world. It is a testament to the art of survival, reminding us that in the animal kingdom, much like in our own, love often takes the most creative and unexpected forms.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Frogs have evolved a repertoire of biological and behavioural techniques to resist unwanted advances.

As representatives of 130 countries gather for a summit in Beijing to mark a decade of the project, AFP looks at some of the key issues surrounding the massive infrastructure project: - Debt, opaque costs - The Belt and Road is a landmark project in President Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas, with Beijing saying it has now inked over two trillion dollars in contracts around the world. Its most high-profile projects have laid down high-speed rail tracks crisscrossing South East Asia and massive transport, energy and infrastructure works through Central Asia. But the flip side of the massive infrastructure spending is the huge debts incurred by participating countries. China said this month that BRI participants owe more than 300 billion to the Export-Import Bank of China. And BRI nations were hit especially hard during the Covid-19 pandemic as soaring inflation and interest rates hurt their ability to repay debts. Critics have also pointed to opaque pricing for the projects built by Chinese companies, with countries including Malaysia and Myanmar renegotiating BRI deals to bring down costs. Residents of BRI nations have also complained that the majority of jobs at infrastructure projects are being done by Chinese workers who send their wages home rather than spend them in local businesses. China has been forced to hand out billions of dollars in bailout loans to BRI countries in recent years to allow the countries to extend their loans and remain solvent, according to a joint report this year by the World Bank and other institutions. - Chinese influence - The BRI has functioned as a diplomatic vehicle burnishing China's image as leader of the global South, while giving Chinese infrastructure firms a foothold in many emerging economies. That has fueled concerns, especially among Western nations, that China is seeking to rebuild the global world order to its advantage, while opposition voices in BRI countries have also decried what they see as increasing Chinese influence in local politics. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that China could use the initiative as a pretext to build up military bases around the world in the name of protecting BRI investments. - Environmental concerns - The initiative has also drawn scrutiny for its massive carbon footprint and the environmental degradation caused by massive infrastructure projects. The development of megaports, pipelines, railways and highways could render the Paris climate goals unreachable, researchers from China, the United States and the United Kingdom warned in 2019. Meanwhile, a report by experts at Boston University's Global Development Policy warned that Chinese-led hard infrastructure projects carry higher risks to indigenous lands and ecosystems due to the country's relative newcomer status in global development finance and its early stages of developing environmental and social risk management due diligence policies and procedures. China has sought to allay environmental fears, promising in 2021 not to build new coal power plants abroad, though many previously agreed projects are still in progress. - Economic benefits - China argues that the BRI brings high-quality development to partner countries -- insisting that while Western projects offer only short-term aid to the Global South, Beijing provides for long-term opportunities with lasting impact. The Boston University researchers noted the BRI's role in providing additional resources for the Global South and fostering significant economic growth. Chinese overseas development finance has been much more focused on industrial and infrastructure lending, they said. Chinese finance is thus more associated with economic growth, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and increased energy access. The World Bank has also said that BRI transport projects -- including railway lines and highways -- substantially improve trade, foreign investment, and living conditions for citizens in participating countries. BRI transport projects, if fully implemented, could raise global income by 0.7 to 2.9 percent, the World Bank estimates.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,Belt and Road Initiative has been criticised for saddling poor countries with enormous debt and causing environmental harm.

The election loss has been described in the media over the weekend as a bloodbath, horror show, utter devastation, a loss of biblical proportions, and a historic defeat. What are leftwing and progressive commentators saying about what went wrong and what Labour now needs to do? Labour's forgotten working class traditions Former Alliance president Matt McCarten, who was Labour's Chief of Staff under David Cunliffe and Andrew Little, is scathing about the current state of the Labour party, describing the party as disconnected from its voters, especially the poor and working class. McCarten told Newsroom's Aaron Smale that Labour has been taken over by middle class people and concerns: They look down on the working class. 'We love the poor, but they smell.' Because they are not part of them. They are in the leafy suburbs, the hip suburbs, the Grey Lynns of this world. And they do not live amongst the working class, they are not of them. They are missionaries. That is what Labour does, 'we do nice things for people. But we do not rock the establishment, we do not rock the middle classes. We keep them quiet'. According to McCarten, the Labour Party reflects a global tendency for leftwing political movements to eschew the working class in favour of managerialism and social issues, which means it can no longer articulate the problems and solutions of ordinary people. He says from the Helen Clark era onwards, the best Labour has been able to offer is to manage capitalism better than National and be nicer: They are not visionaries, they are just nice people. Well fck that, when you are poor, you do not care if they are nice or not nice. You just want hope. Leftwing political commentator Josie Pagani agrees, writing in the Post that Labour has lost its class focus: The priorities of traditional Labour supporters, working people on low incomes, were put lower on the agenda than the priorities of the urban middle class. Jacinda Ardern was willing to spend 678 million to subsidise businesses to decarbonise, for example, but said free dental care, at roughly the same cost, was an unaffordable dream. She argues Labour can no longer be identified with any great causes. Similarly, leftwing political writer Max Rashbrooke tweeted in the weekend that Labour has lost its identity and purpose, and this was a problem before the party won power in 2017: Labour did not have a clear set of priorities or a coherent view of the world it wanted. Had not done the work in opposition; and like global counterparts, unsure what being 'Labour' means now. As a result, Rashbrooke says Labour does not focus enough on the needs of working people: The failure to do anything meaningful on the colossal modern issue of insecure work - even though helping 'labour' is literally in the name - is especially striking and speaks to a long term failure of nerve, vision and willingness to shift the narrative on key issues. Priorities were never clear, except when they really dug in on something - like 3 Waters - and people went, 'Oh, so that is a priority. Who knew?' He says the Labour needs a deep rethink of its core ideology, strategy and policies. A failure to focus on economics Labour's disconnect from the importance of the economy and people's day-to-day struggles was epitomised by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's insistence that no cost of living crisis was occurring under her watch. By the time the election rolled around, it became all about the state of the economy and living standards and, according to Listener writer Danyl Mclauchlan, Labour never managed to grasp this: After promising to focus on the cost of living, Labour delivered piecemeal handouts - subscription subsidies, the GST exemption - which were more than cancelled out by their increases in fuel taxes. In a campaign in which the nation demanded change, Hipkins promised stasis. The Spinoff's Hayden Donnell also cites Hipkins' decision to reject radical tax reform for Labour's demise: Hipkins' 'captain's call' sealed off election opportunities for Labour.... Without real tax relief to offer people on lower incomes, Hipkins became a salesman with nothing to sell. And Donnell says that this was a real problem during a cost of living crisis: When it came time to present his alternative, Hipkins could only offer 45c off parsnips and some free dental for some people in three years' time. Leftwing political commentator Gordon Campbell also singles out Labour's weak economic policies as one of the main reasons the public lost faith in the government. In his column he argues the 2020 administration had a mandate to carry out the radical left wing surgery that the country's various ills required. Campbell lists what this might have looked like: A more radical agenda could have included a capital gains tax, a wealth tax, meaningful anti-trust action against the virtual cartels being run by banks and supermarkets, a windfall tax on their profits, making Working for Families income supports available to beneficiary families, funding Kiwibank so that it can compete significantly with the Aussie banks etc etc. Constitutional and co-governance reform If Labour was less focused on traditional leftwing, economic or working class concerns, then what has been the party's reform programme while in government? Some critics on the left have identified co-governance and related decolonisation agendas as filling the void in Labour's reform agenda, arguing that Labour's Mori caucus became increasingly dominant in the government and determined to deliver a radicalism that would help retain their seats from the revived Te Pati Mori. For example, writing for the Interest website, Chris Trotter paints a picture of the 2017-2023 government being equally as radical as David Lange's Fourth Labour Government, and having now been punished in a similar way to the 1990s when Labour's vote plummeted and even Phil Goff lost his Mt Roskill seat to National. But whereas the LangeDouglas Government was radical in terms of a rightwing economics programme, Trotter suggests the ArdernHipkins Government was radical in terms of wholesale constitutional reform and co-governance in particular - that were growing out of the Crown's newfound commitment to 'indigenisation' and 'decolonisation'. Trotter argues that Labour never managed - or even tried - to take the public along with its big reforms, seeking to suppress debate rather than openly communicate their changes: Massive changes in education and health policy were introduced without adequate explanation or justification. Jarring changes in the linguistic structure of official communications were implemented without consultation, leaving many New Zealanders feeling culturally disoriented and politically ignored. Although the Herald's Simon Wilson supports co-governance, he also blames Labour's approach to implementing this policy, saying good people felt estranged by co-governance. As with many of its other reforms, Wilson suggests that Labour did so in a top-down way, failing to take communities with them. Covid-19 and conservatism Wilson wrote that Covid-19 was partly responsible for Labour's demise, as the pandemic's hangover lingered: The social trauma has been far deeper and more widespread than expected. And he also blames Hipkins for not being bolder: He failed to grasp that voters who want change actually do want change and will not settle for trivialities. GST off the veges, but no structural tax reform? Was it a joke? Nope. It was a betrayal. Wilson also makes the very good point that Labour's fear of boldness and change was actually self-defeating, because voters did want action: Labour was scared of change. One of the great fallacies in politics is that there is a big middle ground of voters who like quiet moderation. Actually, voters want things to be better. Those who swing from one party to another are not looking to reinforce the status quo. They have become disillusioned and want a shake-up. Progressive business journalist Bernard Hickey argues that Labour's loss came from its desire to go into government promising great transformation that could not be delivered by remaining economically orthodox: Labour lost the 2023 election in 2017 when it committed to the Budget Responsibility Rules, while also committing to 100,000 Kiwibuild homes, the Auckland CBD-Airport rail line, welfare reform and a capital gains tax review. They were incompatible and the inevitable disappointment upon failing on Kiwibuild, light rail, and welfare reform. He believes that the government's Covid response was an additional factor in its demise: The revolt against government over the Covid restrictions in late 2021 punctured that 2020 election bubble. Listener writer Danyl Mclauchlan also cites Covid and failure to deliver on promises: Hipkins was indirectly responsible for much of his party's decline. He was minister for Covid, and the early phase was a triumph that voters rewarded in 2020. But 2021 saw one of the slowest vaccine rollouts in the OECD after the government failed to negotiate purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies. The lack of vaccine coverage led to the sustained Auckland lockdown of late 2021, a policy failure that the nation's largest city has punished them for by delivering a number of Labour's safest seats to National. Mt Roskill and New Lynn have fallen, Mt Albert and Te Atat look set to fall. Hipkins was also minister for health, education, police and public service: all areas in which his government's legacy is questionable at best. What happens next for Labour? It is clear that Labour now needs to do a lot of soul-searching, or even to rediscover its political and ideological soul. Unfortunately, the Labour caucus is rather lacking in personnel at the moment who might achieve this. Gordon Campbell argues that Hipkins' replacement cannot be Grant Robertson, who is not only past his 'use by' date, but has been more part of the problem than part of the solution, starting with his decision to bind Labour to Blairite budget constraints. He nominates David Parker as the best option among Labour's surviving roster of senior MPs who might have the will and the ability to shift Labour back in the leftwards direction necessary, and he is the only potential leader able to sort out Labour's pressing existential problem of deciding what its purpose is. Other leadership options currently being talked about include Carmel Sepuloni, Peeni Henare, and Barbara Edmonds. Whoever is chosen, Campbell recommends that they keep away from the lobbyists, businesspeople, and focus groups Labour has relied upon so heavily for the last six years in power. Only then will Labour be able to reconnect with its traditional values. Simon Wilson says Labour faces the existential question: What is the point of Labour in the 2020s? He suggests the problem is that the party is against change, and unfortunately, the political right has now claimed the role of giving optimism and hope to ordinary people. According to Josie Pagani, Labour needs significant renewal, and to reach outside the party for debate and ideas - something she says the party has not done for a long time. Finally, she offers the following example of how complacency can be fatal: The French Socialist party is a salutary reminder of the alternative. After many decades in and out of government, the party cratered on just 1.75 percent of the vote in 2022. Parties that do not change sometimes disappear.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Former Alliance president Matt McCarten is scathing about the current state of the Labour party.

Rite Aid seeks bankruptcy to deal with suits, losses NEW YORK -- Rite Aid has filed for bankruptcy protection and plans to sell part of its business as it attempts to restructure while dealing with losses and opioid-related lawsuits. The company said Rite Aid stores will continue to fill prescriptions, and customers will still be able to visit its locations or shop online while it goes through the reorganization. But that process also will allow it to speed up its plan to close underperforming stores and will help significantly reduce the company's debt while helping to resolve litigation claims in an equitable manner, Rite Aid late October 15. Rite Aid Corp. runs more than 2,100 stores in the YOU.S., mostly on the East and West Coasts, and has posted annual losses for several years. The company no longer has any retail presence in South Carolina. The company, which is marking its 60th birthday this year, has been cutting costs and closing some stores as it has dealt with long-standing financial challenges. The company, like its rivals, also faces financial risk from lawsuits over opioid prescriptions. Rite Aid already has reached several settlements, including a deal announced last year with the state of West Virginia for up to 30 million.

It now projects full-year adjusted earnings between 1.45 and 1.65 per share due to lower-than-anticipated revenue for Covid-19-related products and inventory write-offs. The company previously expected 3.25 to 3.45 per share. JPMorgan said the company's update solves an ongoing YOU.S. Paxlovid inventory debate and it anticipates the company's bigger-than-expected cuts to its sales projections will help put a floor under per-share earnings expectations for next year. Canadian car plant workers ratify GM offer TORONTO -- Canadian autoworkers have voted to ratify a three-year contract agreement with General Motors. Members of Unifor, the union representing about 4,300 Canadian workers at three Ontario GM facilities, voted 80.5 percent in favor of the deal, the union said October 15. The vote followed the pattern of an agreement reached earlier with Ford, and it leaves only Jeep maker Stellantis without a contract. Talks have yet to start with Stellantis, which has the largest Canadian manufacturing footprint of Detroit's three automakers. The GM agreement came after a brief strike last week by the workers at GM factories in Oshawa and St. Catharines, Ontario, and a parts warehouse in Woodstock, Ontario. GM says in a statement that the deal recognizes worker contributions while positioning the company to be competitive in the future. Unifor said that the deal includes pay raises of nearly 20 percent for production workers and 25 percent for skilled trades. Workers would get 10 percent in general pay raises in the first year, with 2 percent in the second and 3 percent in the third. The company also agreed to restore cost-of-living pay raises starting in December of 2024. Temporary workers would get pay raises, and those with at least one year of service would get permanent jobs. In the YOU.S., strikes continue by the United Auto Workers union with nearly 34,000 workers off their jobs at all three Detroit companies. Ford chair says carmaker's future at stake DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. executive chairman Bill Ford called on autoworkers to come together and end a monthlong strike that he says could cost the company the ability to invest in the future. In a rare speech during contract talks in Dearborn, Mich., Ford said high labor costs could limit future investments.

SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Summary The characters in the Netflix series The Fall of the House of Usher have significant nmes that connect to Poe's stories and poems. Many of the characters in the show face fates similar to their on-page counterparts, adding a dark twist to their storylines. The names of the characters hold deeper meanings that align with their personalities and actions throughout the series. Roderick Usher has six children who are dead by the end of The Fall of the House of Usher, and all of them have significant names. Since the Netflix show is based on Edgar Allen Poe's story of the same name, it is no surprise there are dark twists throughout its eight episodes. The characters in the show are spoiled and entitled, but they all get their comeuppance by The Fall of the House of Usher's ending. Their deaths are even connected to the meanings behind their names. Characters in a show based on Poe's work certainly could not have ordinary names, and The Fall of the House of Usher ensures they do not. In fact, all the names come from Poe's stories and poems. And although not every character faces a fate similar to their on-page counterpart, some of them do. This is a pretty clever way of honoring Poe and fans of his work in Netflix's The Fall of the House of Usher. From the youngest kid to all of Roderick illegitimate children, every character has a deeper meaning behind their name. Frederick Usher Frederick Usher was named after Frederick from Poe's first printed short story, Metzengerstein: A Tale in Imitation of the German. In German, Frederick is known to mean peace or peaceful ruler, which is ironic, as nothing about the Usher family suggests they live in peace. In Metzengerstein, Frederick exhibits cruel behavior due to his immense power at a young age. In the end, he dies in a fire after entering a burning castle. This is pretty similar to how Frederick dies in The Fall Of The House Of Usher: in the demolition of a building. However, Frederick's death is also inspired by Poe's story The Pit and The Pendulum. Tamerlane Usher In The Fall of the House Of Usher, Tamerlane Usher runs her own wellness brand. However, Tamerlane does not practice what she preaches, and she is pretty terrible to her husband. She dies a gruesome death after smashing the mirrors in her bedroom. The Usher child's name comes from Poe's poem, Tamerlane, which is about a ruler who sacrifices love for power. This plays well into the new Netflix series, which is seemingly all about power and money. The name itself is typically used for men, but it translates to power and resilience, two things Tamerlane strives for throughout the series. Victorine Lafourcade Victorine Lafourcade is one of Roderick Usher's illegitimate children. Her death is based on Poe's story The Tell-Tale Heart, but her name comes from a different story. Victorine dies in a murder-suicide after killing her girlfriend, who wants to expose her family. In the Poe story The Premature Burial, Victorine is accidentally buried alive by her lover, causing the narrator to also fear being buried alive. In Latin, Victorine means victory -- and while the Usher child does die, she is victorious in stopping her girlfriend from exposing her family. Camille L'Espanaye Camille L'Espanaye is also an illegitimate child of Roderick and runs public relations for the family. Camille's name comes from Poe's short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue. In the story, a woman and her daughter, Camille, are murdered by an orangutan after escaping a sailor's capture. This is pretty close to how Camille is killed in The Fall of the House of Usher, as she goes to Victorine's lab and is murdered by monkeys. Camille has French origins and is said to mean priest's helper, which connects to the way Camille is Roderick's helper, aiding him in controlling the public image of the family. Napoleon Leo Usher Napoleon Leo Usher is inspired by a character in Edgar Allen Poe's story The Black Cat. However, his name actually comes from another Poe story: The Spectacles. In the story, Napoleon is nearly tricked into marrying his great-great-grandmother. This is not showcased in The Fall of the House of Usher. Instead, Napoleon is dating a man named Julius, and he dies when he falls out the window of their apartment. The name Napoleon has many origins but is seemingly based on the Napoleon Complex (named after Napoleon Bonaparte), which the Usher family certainly has. Prospero Perry Usher Prospero Perry Usher is the youngest Usher to die and the first to be killed by Verna. Prospero hosts a wild party at a warehouse, which ends in him and most of his guests dying from acid rain. The masquerade party Prospero hosts comes straight from the Poe story The Masque of the Red Death. In The Masque of the Red Death, Prince Prospero hosts a masquerade party to avoid a plague, but he is killed by a masked figure during the festivities. Prospero translates to prosperous or fortunate, and while the character dies an unfortunate death in The Fall of the House of Usher, he does live a lavish life while he is alive. As the youngest, he is quite flashy, unapologetically showing up at his brother's wife's house in a fancy car and inviting her to his party. Lenore Usher Lenore is not Roderick's child. She is actually Frederick's daughter, making her Roderick's granddaughter. Lenore is different from the rest of the characters in The Fall of the House of Usher, as she is relatively innocent and does not deserve to die. Roderick even feels that Lenore shares positive qualities with his first wife, Annabel Lee. Lenore is based on the character from the Edgar Allen Poe poem The Raven. In the story, the main character is visited by a raven while mourning the death of his love, Lenore. The name Lenore has been interpreted as meaning shining light, which fits Lenore's character well, as she is the only decent member of the main family in The Fall of the House of Usher. Lenore gets a much more peaceful death than her relatives, which also fits well with her name. Unfortunately, the fact that she is an Usher means that her life cannot be spared. The way Roderick is haunted by Lenore's death is similar to the main character in The Raven who is mourning their love. It is also a nice way to pay homage to Poe's work in the Netflix series The Fall of the House of Usher.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Fall of the House of Usher is based on Edgar Allen Poe's story of the same name. Many of the characters in the show face fates similar to their on-page counterparts, adding a dark twist to their storylines. Roderick Usher has six children who are dead by the end of the series, and all of them have significant names. From the youngest kid to all of Roderick's illegitimate children, every character has a deeper meaning behind their name. This is a pretty clever way of honoring Poe and fans of his work."

A queer professor at Arizona State University was allegedly left bloodied after an altercation broke out last week between him and two members of a conservative group, in what authorities are investigating as a hate crime. David Boyles -- who teaches English and is the co-founder of Drag Story Hour Arizona -- was confronted on ASU's campus by two men with the right-wing group Turning Point USA on Wednesday. The next day the group posted online a 96-second video showing Boyles being followed by a cameraman and a personality named Kalen D'Almeida firing contentious questions regarding his work with Drag Story Hour. Drag Story Hour is a national group with local chapters across the country that organizes events where drag performers read children's books to kids at bookstores, libraries, LGBTQ centers and other public venues. You cannot run, D'Almeida said. It is best if you just talk to me on why you want to push sodomy to young people. The Turning Point USA video shows Boyles ignoring the men until the end of the clip, when Boyles appears to strike the camera and the video cuts out. Security footage released by law enforcement shows Boyles striking the camera and D'Almeida subsequently pushing Boyles to the floor, causing him to hit his face. Police told KPNX-TV, an NBC affiliate based in Mesa, Arizona, that they are investigating the confrontation as a potential bias or prejudicially motivated incident. A spokesperson for the Arizona State University Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for an update on the case. Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet told the local outlet that the cameraman plans to file a police report because of the altercation. Boyles posted a photo on Facebook last week showing the left side of his face bloodied. My physical injuries are relatively minor and I am doing ok, Boyles wrote. But I am also feeling angry, violated, embarrassed, and despairing at the fact that we have come to normalize this kind of harassment and violence against anyone who tries to support LGBTQ youth (ironically the topic of the class I had just finished teaching) or just LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups in general. He added, Whether it is bomb threats against children's hospitals and libraries, a store owner being killed for her pride flag, or the now standard rhetoric that anyone who supports LGBTQ youth is a 'groomer,' it has to stop. On Saturday, ASU President Dr. Michael Crow condemned the altercation in a letter posted on the university's website. It is astounding to me that individuals from Turning Point USA would wait for an ASU instructor to come out of his class to follow him, harass him and ultimately shove him to the ground, bloodying his face, Crow said. The ASU incident comes as anti-LGBTQ demonstrations and attacks have spiked in the last year across the country. From June 2022 to May, there was an average of 39 anti-LGBTQ protests per month, compared with just three per month from January 2017 through May 2022, according to a recent report by the Crowd Counting Consortium, a research group that tracks political protests. Additionally, there have been several high-profile acts of violence allegedly incited by anti-LGBTQ sentiments in recent months, including multiple bomb threats. In July, the fatal stabbing of a 28-year-old gay professional dancer, O'Shae Sibley in Brooklyn, New York, made national headlines. Police later deemed the stabbing hate crime. Similarly, the killing of Laura Ann Carleton, a California business owner and mother of nine, sent shock waves around the nation. Carleton was fatally shot during an altercation over a Pride flag displayed in her clothing store. Last month, police in Salt Lake City, Utah, New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, all responded to separate bomb threats to LGBTQ spaces or events within the same weekend.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"David Boyles is the co-founder of Drag Story Hour Arizona.

The PJ Media Slack channel lit up over the weekend with Twitter images of what was purported to be Israel's Iron Beam defense system in action, shooting down at least two incoming projectiles. But when I finally got around to checking Slack on Sunday night, every single tweet featuring Iron Beam had been deleted. Apparently, internet pranksters had again used videos generated by the Arma 3 platform to fool Twitter into believing that Iron Beam was already in use. While that does not appear to be the case, at least not yet, various sources report that Israel is working furiously on their close-in air defense system as the Hamas War rages on in the Gaza Strip. But about that name... Iron Dome is Israel's well-known and fully operational missile defense system. Unlike America's various ballistic missile defense, designed to shoot down small numbers of nuclear-tipped missiles incoming from China, Russia, or some rogue state like North Korea or Iran, Iron Dome is a strictly local affair. In service since 2011, Iron Dome is a truck-towed, mobile air defense system whose primary job is shooting down Hamas and Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israeli cities. The problem with Iron Dome is that while homemade missiles like Hamas and Hezbollah use are inexpensive, antimissile missiles run up to 150,000 a pop, and each missile battery costs about 50 million to manufacture. The costs do not exactly work in Jerusalem's favor. ASIDE: For the record, MTG never used the phrase Jewish space lasers. But, before she was elected to Congress, she did once share on Facebook a rumor about the possibility that secret lasers controlled by the Rothschilds -- intended to clear land for then-Gov. Jerry Brown's high-speed rail project -- had started a series of deadly wildfires. I have no room to criticize because my entire Twitter feed is one disqualification from public office after another. Enter, Israelis with fricken laser beams. Iron Beam is a: 100kW class High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS). It is designed to intercept a wide range of threats such as Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM) and UAVs. Israeli defense firm Rafael revealed Iron Beam at the Singapore Airshow in 2014. Its job is to defend at ranges too short for Iron Dome -- and for a lot less money, too. Firing a laser beam and an incoming projectile costs just 2,000. Cheap at twice the price! Just a year ago, Defense News reported that deployment had slipped to at least 2024, maybe 2025. Could Rafael speed things up in time for use during the current conflict? Rafael exec Michael Lurie told Defense News back then, We do not have a technology problem or a scientific problem anymore... it is now an engineering problem. Maybe they have rushed things along enough over the last 12 months to produce a working prototype but I would not bet money on that I could not afford to lose. But I would wager a mortgage payment that the IDF has at least one working battery in time for the next major war. What does it all mean?

The order from YOU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is a milestone moment in the federal case that accuses Trump of illegally conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Special counsel Jack Smith's team had raised alarm about a barrage of statements disparaging prosecutors, the judge and prospective witnesses. Those comments, prosecutors said, risked undermining public confidence in the court system and causing witnesses or people who might be picked as jurors for trial to feel harassed and intimidated.

In seeking a gag order, Smith's team accused the 2024 GOP presidential front-runner of using online attacks to try to undermine the public's confidence in the justice system and taint the jury pool. Trump's lawyer John Lauro accused prosecutors of seeking to censor a political candidate in the middle of a campaign. But the judge shot back that Trump does not have a right to say and do exactly as he pleases. You keep talking about censorship like the defendant has unfettered First Amendment rights. He does not, Chutkan said. We are not talking about censorship here. We are talking restrictions to ensure there is a fair administration of justice on this case. Chutkan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, repeatedly warned Trump's lawyer to keep politics out of the courtroom, and she cut him off when he suggested the case was politically motivated. Prosecutor Molly Gaston on Monday had told the judge Trump's lawyers were arguing their client is above the law and not subject to the same rules as other defendants. Gaston said Trump knows that his posts motivate people to threaten others, and she argued those can not only pollute the jury pool but also can chill witnesses. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio We have no interest in stopping the defendant from running for office or defending his reputation, she said. Chutkan also read aloud statements Trump has made about her, deriding her as a radical Obama hack. Although she said she was less concerned about statements that Trump has made about her, she said his free speech does not extend to language that knowingly invites threats and harassment of people who are simply doing their jobs. The gag order proposal underscored the unprecedented complexities of prosecuting the GOP presidential primary front-runner, who has made the line of attack central to his campaign. And it presented a big test for Chutkan, who must balance Trump's First Amendment right to defend himself publicly with the need to protect the integrity of the case. It marked the beginning of what could be an extraordinary fight over what limits can be placed on the speech of a defendant who is also running for America's highest public office. Any gag order from Chutkan is likely be challenged on appeal and could ultimately end up before the YOU.S. Supreme Court, legal experts have said. Trump's campaign had seized on the proposal of a gag order in fundraising appeals, and Trump falsely characterized it as an attempt to prevent him from criticizing President Joe Biden. Trump's defense called the gag order request unconstitutional and a desperate effort at censorship. The Chutkan hearing came on the heels of a judge overseeing Trump's civil fraud trial in New York imposing a more limited gag order prohibiting personal attacks against court personnel following a social media post from Trump that maligned the judge's principal clerk. Monday was the first time Trump's lawyers had appeared before Chutkan since she denied Trump's request to recuse herself from the case, which alleges Trump illegally schemed to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The defense had claimed Chutkan's comments about Trump in other cases raised questions about whether she had prejudged his guilt. But Chutkan said her comments were mischaracterized and there was no need for her to step aside. Trump has frequently used social media to attack Chutkan, prosecutors, likely witnesses and others despite warnings from the judge that inflammatory comments could force her to move up the trial currently scheduled to begin in March. Prosecutors noted in a recent motion that Trump's incendiary rhetoric continued even after their initial gag order request. They cited critical comments about witnesses referenced in the indictment -- such as former Attorney General William Barr -- and a social media post suggesting that Mark Milley, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had committed treason and should be executed. Prosecutors said their proposal would not have prevented Trump from publicly declaring his innocence. In court papers, they wrote that Trump was demanding special treatment by claiming he should have free rein to publicly intimidate witnesses and disparage others involved in the case. In this case, Donald J. Trump is a criminal defendant like any other, Smith's team wrote. Richer reported from Boston.

Piper Laurie, the strong-willed, Oscar-nominated actor who performed in acclaimed roles despite at one point abandoning acting altogether in search of a more meaningful life, has died. She was 91. She received Academy Award nominations for three very different films: The 1961 poolroom drama The Hustler; the film version of Stephen King's horror classic Carrie, in 1976; and the romantic drama Children of a Lesser God, in 1986. She also appeared in several acclaimed roles on television and the stage, including in David Lynch's Twin Peaks in the 1990s.

The settlement also prohibits the federal government from separating any migrant families crossing the border for eight years, unless the parents are considered a danger to their children or the public or they have previously entered the country illegally more than twice. The deal, announced by the Justice Department, may end one of the darkest chapters in YOU.S. immigration policy, in which families crossing the YOU.S.-Mexico border illegally in 2017 and 2018 were systematically separated. Children younger than 18 were sent to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, while parents were prosecuted by YOU.S. attorneys in federal court. But the settlement could be derailed by Republicans in Congress if they challenge the court's mandate to appropriate money to reunify and provide services to separated families. YOU.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw of the Southern District of California is expected to approve the proposed settlement, but he may be asked to review objections. Those objections could come from parties such as America First Legal, a conservative legal group run by Stephen Miller, the former Trump adviser who was considered the architect of the family separation policy. The families also sought financial compensation from the YOU.S. government, but the Biden administration's Justice Department abruptly walked away from those negotiations two years ago when President Joe Biden was asked if families would be receiving 450,000 each and he said it was not going to happen. Individual families are still seeking damages in civil court, where the Biden administration has been fighting them. While no settlement can ever wipe away this tragic episode in our country's history, the settlement is a much-needed step forward to help the thousands of families that were so brutally separated under the Trump administration, said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead counsel representing the families in the case. The settlement will allow little children to finally see their parents after years of separation and permit suffering families to seek permanent status in the YOU.S. Critically, it will also prohibit such a cruel policy in the future. Whatever one thinks about border policy generally, there can be no disagreement that ripping babies and toddlers from their parents is morally repugnant. On a call with reporters about the settlement, a Department of Homeland Security official said family separation was a cruel and inhumane policy. That official added that that more than 3,000 separated families have been reunified and hundreds more remain separated. The agreement also covers more than 290 children, who are YOU.S. citizens separated from noncitizen parents at the border by the Trump administration, who were not previously included in the lawsuit.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"More than 4,000 migrants who were separated from their families at the YOU.S.-Mexico border by the Trump administration reached a legal settlement Monday.

Dressed in an orange prison-issued jumpsuit, his hair disheveled, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba answered yes sir to the judge but otherwise sat quietly in a Will County courtroom where he was formally charged with three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery and two counts of committing a hate crime. Investigators said the deadly attack that resulted in the death of Wadea Al-Fayoume was linked to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East. In their petition requesting that Czuba be detained, prosecutors said that right before the attack, the landlord confronted the boy's mother, Hanaan Shahin, and told her he was angry at her for what was going on in Israel. Shahin stated she responded to him 'let us pray for peace', the petition said. Shahin stated Czuba gave her no chance to do anything... then attacked her with a knife. Czuba, the boy's mother told investigators, was an angry man. His wife, Mary, told investigators that Czuba listens to conservative talk radio on a regular basis and became obsessed with the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. Shahin also told police she had been texting Czuba's wife about her husband's hatred for Muslims. On October 11, Czuba said he wanted Shahin and her son move out of the home, Mary Czuba told investigators. Shahin told deputies that on that same day, Czuba confronted her about what was going on in the Middle East. Czuba's arraignment and detention came on the same day that hundreds of people were expected to say farewell to Wadea, who authorities said died Saturday after the landlord stabbed him 26 times. His 32-year-old mother was stabbed a dozen times while trying to protect her son and call for help, police said. She was still recovering at the hospital while mourners gathered for her son's funeral at the Mosque Foundation in suburban Bridgeview. Czuba was screaming you Muslims have to die when he barged into the ground floor apartment mother and son shared in suburban Plainfield, family friend Yousef Hannon told NBC News before the funeral, citing texts she sent to the boy's father. Hannon said Czuba also shouted, You are killing our kids in Israel. You Palestinians do not deserve to live. Shaheen did not have even one percent suspicion he would hurt the child because Czuba had been like a grandfather to Wadea and even built him a tree house, Hannon said. The child, when he saw Czuba, ran to him for a hug and instead was stabbed 26 times, Hannon said. Wadea was pronounced dead at the hospital, after which a forensic pathologist removed a military style knife with a seven-inch blade from his abdomen, the Will County sheriff's office said in a news release. The YOU.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, which is based in Chicago, opened a federal criminal hate crimes investigation into the killing of the little boy. The brutal assault was condemned earlier by President Joe Biden and sparked fears that ongoing war between Hamas and Israel could result in retribution attacks against Palestinian immigrants in the YOU.S. Hate has no place in America, Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement released Monday. We unequivocally condemn hate and Islamophobia and stand with the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities. Wadea's family came to the YOU.S. from the West Bank and settled in the Chicago suburbs about a dozen years ago to get away from the violence in the Palestinian territory, according to the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Reached by telephone, Czuba's brother, David, said the family was preparing a statement and declined to make any further comment. Czuba did not make any statements to detectives regarding his involvement in this heinous attack when sheriff's deputies responding to the unfolding tragedy found him with a laceration on his forehead sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence, the Will County sheriff's office said earlier. Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis, the sheriff's office said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Joseph Czuba, 71, is accused of stabbing 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume 26 times.

The move comes as fears mount of escalation as Israel stands poised for what government officials are saying will be the next phase of the war against Hamas with an all-out air, sea, and land invasion of Gaza. Royal Caribbean Group confirmed that it was working with the YOU.S. Its cruise ship, the Rhapsody of the Seas (78,878 gross tons) which had been idled in Cyprus, was dispatched to Haifa overnight. The cruise ship, which was built in 1997, had been operating cruises from Israel that were canceled last week after the war began. The embassy in Israel announced that embarkation would begin at 8:00 a.m. this morning local time advising American nationals who had the proper paperwork to arrive at the terminal by 8:00 a.m. and that boarding would be on a first-come basis. The embassy was only saying that space would be limited, but media reports said they hoped to load as many as 2,500 people aboard. The cruise ship, which is registered in the Bahamas, has approximately 1,000 passenger cabins and a normal maximum passenger capacity of just over 2,400 people along with 765 crew. It was unclear if everyone was being assigned a cabin or if the ship would take deck passengers for the trip, which was expected to last 10 to 12 hours. Israeli media were reporting the scene at the dock was chaotic today. Embassy personnel were trying to guide the process, but at times recommended people leave and return later in smaller groups. Each passenger was permitted just one suitcase of up to 50 lbs. and a small carry-on bag. No pets were being embarked on the ship. They were being told that food and Wi-Fi would be available onboard and the YOU.S. consular staff would be traveling to assist the people evacuating from Israel. The cruise ship departed Haifa shortly after 4:00 p.m. local time after about seven hours in Haifa and is returning to Cyprus. According to its AIS signal, it is sailing at about 10 knots and is due to reach Limassol at 8:00 a.m. local time tomorrow, October 17. The YOU.S. Embassy in Cyprus will provide buses from the ship to the two airports on Cyprus, but onward travel and accommodations is the individual's responsibility. The embassy in Israel was reporting that charter flights would be conducted out of Cyprus due to the limited availability of commercial service. On Sunday, the YOU.S. Embassy wrote in an advisory, We urge those wishing to leave to take advantage, of its travel arrangements which also included planned charter flights from Israel to nearby safe locations. With commercial flights remaining very limited out of Israel, the YOU.S. said it would be offering seats on a space-available basis on an unspecified number of charters. They advised the family members of YOU.S. government employees and some non-emergency personnel would also be authorized to depart. It is unclear if the YOU.S. has plans for any further emergency evacuations from Israel. All the major cruise lines last week suspended their port calls, as did most commercial airlines. It was reported that MSC Cruises chartered an Israeli-owned cruise ship, Crown Iris (40,000 gross tons), and on Sunday the cruise ship spent about 10 hours in Haifa disembarking Israelis that had been on an MSC cruise when the war broke out.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The YOU.S. State Department and the Embassy in Israel announced that it chartered a cruise ship to accelerate the departure of YOUS. nationals and their immediate families from Israel.

There were few initial details about the incident, as well as a rocket that struck a neighborhood just northwest of the airport, killing a child. The Taliban initially described the two strikes as separate incidents, though information on both remained scarce and witnesses heard only one large blast Sunday in the Afghan capital. The airstrike came as the United States winds down a historic airlift that saw tens of thousands evacuated from Kabul's international airport, the scene of much of the chaos that engulfed the Afghan capital since the Taliban took over two weeks ago. After an Islamic State affiliate's suicide attack that killed over 180 people, the Taliban increased its security around the airfield as Britain ended its evacuation flights Saturday. YOU.S. military cargo planes continued their runs into the airport Sunday, ahead of a Tuesday deadline earlier set by President Joe Biden to withdraw all troops from America's longest war. However, Afghans remaining behind in the country worry about the Taliban reverting to their earlier oppressive rule -- something fueled by the recent shooting death of a folk singer in the country by the insurgents. Two American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers. YOU.S. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the American military's Central Command, called the drone strike an action taken in self-defense. He said authorities continued assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time. We are confident we successfully hit the target, Urban said. Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid earlier said in a message to journalists that the YOU.S. strike targeted a suicide bomber as he drove a vehicle loaded with explosives. Mujahid offered few other details. The strike was the second by America since the airport suicide bombing. On Saturday, a strike in Nangarhar province killed an Islamic State member believed to be involved in planning attacks against the United States in Kabul. The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group's more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority, including a 2020 assault on a maternity hospital in Kabul in which they killed women and infants. The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a YOU.S.-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 911 attacks, which al-Qaida orchestrated while being sheltered by the group. The rocket attack struck Kabul's Khuwja Bughra neighborhood, said Rashid, the Kabul police chief who goes by one name. Video obtained by The Associated Press in the aftermath of the attack showed smoke rising from building at the site around a kilometer (half a mile) from the airport. No group immediately claimed the attack, however militants have fired rockets in the past. Meanwhile, the family of a folk singer north of Kabul say the Taliban killed him under unclear circumstances in recent days. The shooting of Fawad Andarabi came in the Andarabi Valley for which he was named, an area of Baghlan province some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kabul. The valley had seen upheaval since the Taliban takeover, with some districts in the area coming under the control of militia fighters opposed to the Taliban rule. The Taliban say they have since retaken those areas, though neighboring Panjshir in the Hindu Kush mountains remains the only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces not under its control. The Taliban previously came out to Andarabi's home and searched it, even drinking tea with the musician, his son Jawad Andarabi told the AP. But something changed Friday. He was innocent, a singer who only was entertaining people, his son said. They shot him in the head on the farm. His son said he wanted justice and that a local Taliban council promised to punish his father's killer. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, told the AP that the insurgents would investigate the incident, but had no other details on the killing. Andarabi played the ghichak, a bowed lute, and sang traditional songs about his birthplace, his people and Afghanistan as a whole. A video online showed him at one performance, sitting on a rug with the mountains of home surrounding him as he sang. There is no country in the world like my homeland, a proud nation, he sang. Our beautiful valley, our great-grandparents' homeland. Karima Bennoune, the United Nations special rapporteur on cultural rights, wrote on Twitter that she had grave concern over Andarabi's killing. We call on governments to demand the Taliban respect the humanrights of artists, she wrote. Agnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, similarly decried the killing. There is mounting evidence that the Taliban of 2021 is the same as the intolerant, violent, repressive Taliban of 2001, she wrote on Twitter. 20 years later. Nothing has changed on that front. Also on Sunday, private banks across Afghanistan resumed their operations. However, they limited withdrawals to no more than the equivalent of 200 a day. While some complained of still being unable to access their money, government employees say they have not been paid over the last four months. The Afghani traded around 90.5 to 1, continuing its depreciation as billions of dollars in the country's reserves remain frozen overseas.

PALOS HEIGHTS, Illinois -- Hours after the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy who was allegedly killed at the hands of a landlord was buried, family and friends retreated to a quiet diner to look back fondly on a once promising life cut short. Wadea Al-Fayoume was remembered Monday evening as a happy child, full of life and spunk, who had grown close to the neighbor and landlord who now stands accused of attacking him and his mother in a hate crime. Friends and family gathered for a dinner at Al Basha Cuisine in Palos Heights, Illinois less than two hours after Wadea was laid to rest. It was in this small restaurant where those who knew Wadea shared details about the boy's short-lived life. He did not have any hate or anger and he was always on a natural high, Mohamed Aly, 41, a close friend of the family who first met the boy on the day he was born, told NBC News during the dinner. More than 100 people gathered to celebrate the child's life over mansaf, a rice and lamb dish known in Palestinian culture. Wadea died Saturday after being stabbed 26 times at his Plainfield home. The Will County Sheriff's Office arrested and charged landlord Joseph Czuba, 71, alleging he targeted and stabbed Wadea and his mother because they were Muslim. Czuba's wife told investigators that Czuba had become obsessed with the war between Hamas and Israel. Wadea's mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, was stabbed more than a dozen times during the encounter, but is expected to survive. Those at the dinner in Palos Heights said the mother and son lived along the upper level of a townhouse, while the landlord resided in the basement. Aly said that in ways, Czuba, who was known to have several signs in his yard supporting former President Donald Trump, adopted the boy as a grandson, buying him a swing, trampoline, toys and gifts. He said Wadea's father, Odey Al-Fayoume, had been wary of them living in Czuba's house because he was a Trump supporter, but they stayed. Shahin told investigators that Czuba was an angry man. In a petition requesting that Czuba be detained, prosecutors said that right before the attack, the landlord confronted Shahin and told her he was angry at her for what was going on in Israel. Shahin stated Czuba gave her no chance to do anything ... then attacked her with a knife. The sheriff's office said Shahin ran into the bathroom and fought off her attacker as she called for help. Following the attack, Shahin asked her son if he was ok. Wadea looked up at his mother and said, I am fine, mama, his final words before passing away, Aly said. Shahin came to the YOU.S. 12 years ago from the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. Wadea's father came to the YOU.S. nine years ago, and Wadea was born in the YOU.S. CAIR executive director Ahmed Rehab said the boy's father told him that they came to the YOU.S. in part to escape violence. He said, 'Part of the reason we came here was to escape the settler violence in which situations like this could occur with impunity and it chased us all the way to the United States,' Rehab said Sunday. As Aly spoke, Odey Al-Fayoume sat at the head of the next table in the middle of the room hugging loved ones and embracing others. Neighbor Abdelbaset Emar, 53, said Wadea befriended his son and together they watched cartoons to help learn English. He would come over all the time, Emar said as he left the dinner. He added that both children played with action figures and often competed in football. Aly thinks back to the day Wadea was brought home from the the hospital after he was born. I saw another angel come into earth. I saw a baby who could fit in the palm of my hand, Aly said. But life did not come without early troubles. Friends said that by age 3, the boy started showing signs of special needs and was later diagnosed with ADHD. Family friend Yousef Hannon, 59, paid for the dinner. When a tragedy like this happens, I have to act, he said. This hate crime affects every Muslim, every Arabic, every Palestinian.

Little is known about the Burevestnik, which translates as Storm Petrel and was code-named Skyfall by NATO. On Russia's defense ministry website, Burevestnik is described as a nuclear-powered cruise missile with an unlimited range. Its nuclear propulsion could allow it to cover a longer distance and stay airborne for a much longer time than other missiles, but may also make it more unreliable, according to experts. Animation shared in 2018 shows the missile flying around the planet, bypassing missile defense systems and eventually reaching the Pacific Coast of North America. But there have been doubts about how quickly Russia could develop a major new weapon of this scale and how easy it would be to handle. A suspected failed test of Burevestnik in 2019 killed five scientists and caused a radiation spike in a nearby city. Technologically, the weapon is not that much of a challenge, said Alberque, but safely deploying it is much more difficult. There is a reason the YOU.S. abandoned this technology in the Cold War. It is just a bad idea, he added. The failed test in 2019 illustrates the dangers of this technology, he added. Talking about its testing may primarily be an attempt to intimidate the West and force concessions on Ukraine, but Moscow withdrawing from the nuclear test ban treaty would be a huge deal, Alberque said. Russia is part of the global monitoring system that helps detect nuclear explosions and losing Russian sensors would deal a hammer blow to that ability, he added. According to the United Nations, the Soviet Union's last nuclear test took place in late 1990, so the resumption of nuclear testing by Putin's Russia would be a major development that could further escalate global tensions. Putin's rhetoric follows months of nuclear threats from some of Russia's most ardent war supporters. Since the early months of the invasion, pundits on Russian state TV have called for nuclear strikes on Western capitals in response to their military aid to Ukraine. Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, has also promised to unleash Russia's nuclear arsenal on multiple occasions. But it appears one of the Kremlin's full-time nuclear war-mongers went a step too far this week. Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Russia's English-language RT network, suggested Sunday that there is no need for nuclear strikes on Washington when a thermonuclear explosion over Russian territory, like Siberia in Russia's far east, would knock out all radioelectronics and satellite systems, in a major blow to the West. Nothing so terrible would happen to the area or locals, she said, adding that it is one of the most humane options she sees available. The comment sparked outrage from some Russian officials, including those in Siberia. The Kremlin has tried to distance itself from Simonyan's comments, saying she does not hold any government positions so her words do not always reflect its official position. Simonyan appeared to backtrack on her words after the wave of outrage, saying she never actually suggested any such heresy.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Little is known about the Burevestnik, which translates as Storm Petrel and was code-named Skyfall by NATO.

Storms, floods, fires and other extreme weather events led to more than 43 million displacements involving children between 2016 and 2021, according to a United Nations report. More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released on Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report -- more than half of them in Somalia -- but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering cities, and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring overlapping crises -- where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who was not involved with the report. When you are desperate, you do things that you normally would not do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they do not have the ability to stand up for themselves, she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become shock-responsive, portable and inclusive, to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children's needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we are just not working fast enough, Healy said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"UNICEF: More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades.

Ice-cold floodwaters swept through mountain towns in India's Himalayan northeast, killing at least 31 people, washing away houses and bridges, and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes, officials said Friday. The flood began shortly after midnight Wednesday, when the waters of a glacial lake overflowed, cracking open Sikkim State's biggest hydroelectric dam and then cascading through towns in the valley below. It was the latest deadly flood to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, record rains in July killed more than 100 people over two weeks in northern India. 6 DEAD, 38 INJURED IN MUMBAI AFTER FIRE ENGULFS 6-STORY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING More than 2,000 people were rescued after Wednesday's floods, the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority said in a statement, adding that state authorities set up 26 relief camps for more than 22,000 people impacted by the floods.

We are evacuating them through helicopters provided by the army and the air force, he said. The South Llonak Lake has been rising in recent years as a warming climate melts the glaciers that feed it, putting pressure on the dam that contains it, but it was not clear what triggered the breach Wednesday. Experts and varying government reports have pointed to sudden, intense rains in the area, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said. Several towns, including Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin, were flooded, and schools in four districts were ordered shut until Sunday, the state's education department said.

However, it was not immediately clear whether they were among the 22 missing soldiers, or had died separately. One soldier who had been reported missing on Wednesday was later rescued by authorities, the army said in a statement. The army is providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen in north Sikkim, the army statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said in a statement that the government would support state authorities in the aftermath of the flooding. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity -- enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes -- and began operations in 2017. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite risks to dams due to increasing frequency of extreme weather, the Indian federal government aims to increase India's hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in India's Himalayan region during the June-September monsoon season. Scientists say they are becoming more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers there. This is, incredibly sadly, another classic case of a cascading hazard chain that amplifies as you go downstream, said Jakob Steiner, a climate scientist with the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, commenting on Wednesday's flash flooding. Earlier this year, Steiner's organization published a report saying that Himalayan glaciers could lose 80 of their volume if global warming is not controlled. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand state in northern India.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Ice-cold floodwaters swept through mountain towns in India's Himalayan northeast, killing at least 31 people.

Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, record rains in July killed more than 100 people over two weeks in northern India.."

We can say the third terminal is the first milestone to realise Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's dream to make Bangladesh an aviation hub, Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (Caab) chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman told BSS today. He said the PM will partially open the new scenic terminal witnessing the trial of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight from the new establishment. The Caab chairman said 90 percent work of the new terminal has been done for the soft launching, and from Saturday airlines would be able to use the new parking bay of the terminal. The third terminal will be fully operational for use by passengers at the end of next year after completion of systems integration and calibration. The new terminal will change the country's image with all world-class amenities and passenger services, said the Caab chief. He said the third terminal's features, with immaculate floor and eye-catching patterns on ceiling and sufficient natural light, are very sophisticated. Passengers will appreciate the world-class facilities of the new terminal which we never had here before, he added. The 12 boarding gates with double entry bridges will be operational by next year while an additional 14 boarding bridges are expected to be installed afterwards. The third terminal project, costing Tk 21,300 crore, commenced on December 28, 2019. The government contributed Tk 5,000 crore, while the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided the remaining funds. Covering an area of 5,42,000 square metres, the third terminal will boast a floor space of 2,30,000 square metres, housing 115 check-in counters, 66 departure immigration desks, 59 arrival immigration and 3 VIP immigration desks. Upon full-fledged operation of the terminal, Dhaka airport's annual passenger and cargo handling capacity is expected to double. The annual passenger handling capacity of the HSIA would be 24 million (including the old terminals) which is now only eight million and the airport can handle 5,00,000 tonnes of cargo each year. The construction work of 37 new aircraft parking areas and two taxiways connecting to the apron area have already been completed. The third terminal is designed to connect with a multimodal transport system to enable passengers to enter and exit the international airport smoothly. The new terminal will be connected with the elevated expressway, underground railway (MRT-5, Kamalapur to airport portion) and also with the airport railway station through an underground tunnel. It is expected to be operated and maintained by a Japanese company under public-private partnership. Ahead of the third terminal's full operation, different foreign airlines are eyeing to start their operation from Dhaka Airport, which is expected to play a great role to take the country's aviation sector forward, experts said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will soft launch the much anticipated third terminal of the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) tomorrow.

Violent thug Amraj Poonia ambushed Mohammed Shah Subhani, 27, at RJ Plumbing in Hounslow, west London, on May 7, 2019. After entering the premises, Mr Subhani was killed and his body rolled up in a carpet to be transported to woodland where it was burnt and buried. Later the same day, Poonia 'unashamedly' went to the Subhani family home in Hounslow and acted as if nothing had happened, an Old Bailey jury was told. The case was initially treated as a missing persons inquiry before a murder investigation was launched and possible suspects identified. Mohammed Shah Subhani was lured to Amraj Poonia's family plumbing business where he was ambushed and murdered Poonia, pictured, was caught on camera ranting and raving at his victim's family as he was arrested Mohammed Shah Subhani, known as Shah, was reported missing on May 7, 2019 when he failed to return to his home in Hounslow, west London The breakthrough came around six months later when an individual, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, walked into a police station, admitted to taking part in the disposal of Mr Subhani's body and named his killer. Acting on the information, Mr Subhani's badly decomposed body was found miles away in woodland in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. The court was told that Mr Subhani was killed at the Poonia business after falling out over a kilo of cannabis that went missing after it was given to Amraj Poonia for safekeeping. But Poonia stole the drugs instead and staged a 'theft' of them from a car as a cover for this. Associate Mohanad Riad had recruited two local drug dealers to help stage the fake theft but suspicions erupted into incidents of violence in the weeks before the killing, jurors heard. The loss of the drugs left Mr Subhani in debt to a local drug dealer and believing Poonia to be responsible caused increasing animosity between the two. According to the Met Police, there were assaults against Poonia by the Subhani family and as a result and threats were made against them for retribution. Contact was made between Poonia and Mr Subhani and an agreement was amde to meet at Poonia's family plumbing business. Mr Subhani arrived at the industrial estate in Hounslow and shortly after entering the premises he was ambushed and murdered. Following Mr Subhani's disappearance, his family reported him missing on May 7 and a full missing person investigation was started. The family attended Derby Road industrial estate to conduct their own CCTV enquiries on 13 May. Here they encountered Poonia and a fight ensued between him and the Subhani brothers. Because of the fight, police were called as Poonia had been seen on bus CCTV footage to be in possession of a large knife. Following the fight, a witness described how they had heard Amraj Poonia say to one of the brothers 'I will kill you like I killed your brother'. Pictured, detectives investigating disappearance and murder of Mohammed Shah Subhani Mr Subhani's remains were found in woodland between Beaconsfield and Gerrards Cross, Buckinhamshire, shortly before Christmas 2019 Poonia was arrested for the affray and, just after his arrest, was recorded on an officers' body-worn video saying: 'I am telling you this on live camera (He then named one of Shah's brothers). You pig rat, snitch, gangster wannabe, you are dead, yeah.' Officers then conducted an extensive forensic search of the plumbing business and small samples of blood were located which matched that of Mr Subhani. The investigation was then passed on to a Homicide team of the Met's Specialist Crime Command. At first, there was insufficient evidence to charge the suspects because they could not find Mr Subhani's body. It was six months later that the breakthrough came when the unnamed person present at the burial site, and not involved in the murder, told the police where to find him. A post-mortem was unable to determine the because of death, due to the loss of some of the remains, significantly, the hyoid bone. But the pathologist did comment that the circumstances of the burial indicated an 'unnatural death'. Following an Old Bailey trial, Amraj Poonia, 28, aka Bigs, from Horley, was found guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice. On Thursday, he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years. His brother Raneel Poonia, 26, aka Ace, from Slough, was jailed for seven years for perverting the course of justice.

In victim impact statements, Mr Subhani's family condemned the killers as 'cowardly animals'. His sister Iqra Subhani said her brother had been robbed of his life 'in the most cowardly and heinous way by his so-called friends'. Addressing the dock, she said: 'Even after you brutally killed him, you did not spare him - you continued to torment him after he was dead. 'My brother had the spirit of a lion. But a lion can only do so much when he is ambushed by hyenas and that is what you cowardly animals did.' Mr Subhani's father, Gul Subhani, described his son's murder as 'pure evil', saying: 'They disregarded his body like a piece of rubbish. He did not go there to fight. He was a lover, not a fighter.' The thought of his son's body being rolled into a carpet and set alight 'makes our skin crawl', he said. He added: 'This is an unending pain for all of us, a pain we will take to our grave. 'How can we have closure when we could not even have 100 per cent of our boy back?' Mr Subhani's partner Thelma, who was pregnant with their child when he was killed, told the court: 'He was my best friend and confidante all in one.' Following the convictions, Detective Chief Inspector Vicky Tunstall said: 'Amraj Poonia is a dangerous individual and I have no doubt that the streets of west London are far safer now he, and his accomplices, have been convicted - I hope that this outcome and the diligent investigation that led to their conviction improves the trust that communities can have in the Metropolitan Police.'",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Amraj Poonia ambushed Mohammed Shah Subhani, 27, at RJ Plumbing in Hounslow, west London, on May 7, 2019.

It is supposed to reach the triple digits this weekend in Los Angeles. Jose Gonzales knows it will be a tough few days -- he and his wife live in an RV along 1st Street in Boyle Heights. We open the windows but the thing is because there is a lot of traffic going by, it picks up a lot of dust, Gonzales told me. He keeps the windows facing the road closed, even though it can be suffocating. When the sun shifts, he unrolls the outside tarp to add more shade. Officials across Southern California are trying to crack down on RV encampments that bloomed during the pandemic, amid complaints from neighbors. But stable housing remains elusive for many encampment residents and yet another heat wave is underscoring just how brutal the wait can be for those without homes. As my colleagues Rachel Uranga and Paloma Esquivel reported recently, many RV dwellers are waiting on Section 8 housing voucher applications as they navigate a labyrinth of alternative options. RV encampments have proliferated on the streets of Los Angeles since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, met with mixed reviews from neighbors. Last year in April, the Los Angeles City Council voted to lift a towing moratorium after growing complaints from residents about waste disposal and drug usage by RV dwellers. The council recently also backed efforts to regulate RV rentals to homeless populations and is considering restricting RV parking around schools and homes. But for many city residents who may not be able to afford rental units, RVs provide a community and home, if an imperfect one as temperatures soar. During the pandemic, Gonzales' wife lost her part-time job, leaving the warehouse worker as the only income earner in their household. When they tried to apply for an apartment, their income was not enough for rent, leading to the choice of an RV for the last two and a half years. Although he has a working air conditioning, Gonzales says that keeping it on drains the battery. He tries to keep his generator rumbling for about four hours maximum during the day. When they run out of options, he and his wife sometimes walk outside toward the park, where the air flows better. Not everyone is blessed with a working generator though. And keeping your RV cool and still keeping other appliances going may force a short circuit. He keeps two fire extinguishers inside his home, just in case Numerous fires have burned through RV encampments, some allegedly due to arson, while others have been sparked by residents trying to keep warm. Gonzales said he keeps a watch on his neighbor's RV. Down the street, Anselmo Villareal sat inside his AC-less RV on Thursday with the windows down, his shirt off. His head was covered in beads of sweat. Right now, I was just going to take a bath to open myself up, Villareal said to me. He relies on showers to keep cool. Sometimes he avoids staying inside the RV altogether, occupying himself with work during the day and arriving back at night. A few vehicles away, another couple cleaned a refrigerator with a bucket of water, splashing droplets on their heads to cool down. Water helps sweat to evaporate. Gonzales also increases his showering frequency in the heat, but even that comes with a cost. He must empty out what he calls gray water every two weeks, instead of the usual three, for 30 at the Pico Rivera RV storage, where he can legally dump waste. The ultimate cooling solution may just be to sit outside. As the RVs became too suffocating, Gonzales said he will pull up chairs with his peers along the street. We parked here, and we parked over there. And that is our home because that is where we are at, he said. 'Flying syringes' and conspiracies: The far-right battle for a mosquito control board.

The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake with enough force to break through the concrete of a major hydroelectric dam downstream. It then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people and forced thousands to flee their homes. Police said that 22 of the dead were found miles downriver in West Bengal state, while 100 people are still missing. It was not clear what triggered the flood. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. The deadly flood was the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, and record rains in northern India killed more than 100 people over two weeks in July. The design and placement of the 6-year-old Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built, part of an Indian push to expand hydropower energy. Local activists argued that extreme weather caused by climate changes makes dam-building in the Himalayas too dangerous, and warned that the dam's design did not include enough safety measures. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified the lake the Teesta 3 dam was built to contain as highly vulnerable to flooding that could cause extensive damage to life and property in downstream areas, warning of the risk of flash floods that could break through dams.

It was huge for her.Albert Baez  Magnolia Pictures One of America's best-known folksingers was around 13 the first time somebody called her a dumb Mexican. Joan Baez says in a new film that a teacher told her that she was the highest breed of Spanish. But Joanie Baez, as she was then called, was not having it. I told her no, I am not. I am a Mexican. I was defending the Mexican race. Now a new documentary takes a look at the life and legacy of the iconic singer, songwriter and activist. In Joan Baez: I Am a Noise, filmmakers follow her on her final concert tour in 2018-19 and delve into her archive of home movies, artwork and diaries. In addition to highlighting Baez's lifelong commitment to social justice, the film explores issues of fame, identity, aging and forgiveness. Baez, 82, was raised in the San Francisco Bay area. Her father was a Mexican-born physicist, and her mother was of Scottish descent. Converts to Quakerism, Baez's parents instilled a social consciousness in her from a young age. Baez recalls in the film that, as a child, I was aware that there were sorrows way greater than mine. Growing up, Baez often felt like an outsider. I thought I was inferior, especially to the white kids, and the rich kids, Baez says in the film. Most of the time at school, I felt 'less than.' I Am a Noise Miri Navasky, one of the film's three directors, said that Baez's Mexican American heritage was foundational for the singer. It was huge for her, both as an insecurity, and as a source of empathy. ... I think that followed her through her whole life, and to some degree, still does. Singing was Baez's escape, her source of joy -- and it led to what became an extraordinary career. A college dropout, Baez was singing barefoot in small coffeehouses around Boston when she was invited to perform at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival. There she was discovered and began a meteoric rise to fame. She sang at Carnegie Hall before she was 18 and landed on the cover of Time magazine at 21. For whatever reason, Baez says in the film, I think I was the right voice at the right time. Baez's crystal-clear soprano and her activism placed her at the center of several musical and political movements. She sparked a resurgence of American folk music, sang at both the landmark 1963 March on Washington and at Woodstock, and helped bring Bob Dylan to prominence. She was in the fields with Cesar Chavez when he was organizing farmworkers and was visited in jail by Martin Luther King Jr. after being arrested for protesting the Vietnam War. She has always believed in the fight for the underdog, in social change, in nonviolence. She is never wavered from these areas of political activity, said I Am a Noise co-director Maeve O'Boyle. She is fought for what she believes in, her entire life. And running parallel to this is an incredible musicality, a love of creativity across the board. In the post-war years, there were many young people excited about the possibilities of new forms of self-expression and new ways of thinking, said New York University arts professor Richard Litvin. Then this brilliant young woman comes on the scene; she has obvious musical gifts and is charismatic, courageous and willing to be present for causes she believed in.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A new documentary takes a look at the life and legacy of the iconic singer, songwriter and activist.

Although internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, the region and its predominantly ethnic Armenian population had been under a de facto separatist government since the 1990s. This resulted from a bloody war -- fought from 1988 to 1994 -- that saw Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia pitted against Azerbaijan, coinciding with the Soviet Union's dissolution. The First Nagorno-Karabakh War, as it is now known, killed around 30,000 people on both sides and displaced more than a million others as Armenians left Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis fled Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and seven adjacent territories that came under Armenian control. In the decades after the 1994 ceasefire, intermittent deadly clashes continued along the line of separation, escalating into intense fighting in April 2016 and then all-out war in September 2020. The hostilities lasted just six weeks but resulted in more than 7,000 military and around 170 civilian casualties. More than 130,000 people were displaced from their homes, mostly Karabakh Armenians who returned by the thousands after a peace deal was reached. Three years on, we are witnessing a mass exodus once again -- one that marks the end of the self-declared Artsakh Republic. For The Beet, journalist Teresa Di Mauro recounts how the fall of Nagorno-Karabakh happened slowly, and then all at once. This story first appeared in The Beet, a weekly email dispatch from Meduza covering Central and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Sign up here to get the next issue delivered directly to your inbox. Lusine Hambardzumyan was at her office in Stepanakert when Azerbaijani forces began attacking Nagorno-Karabakh on September 19. The children were at school, and I was sitting at work. Suddenly, we heard some loud, intense sound of bombs. It was horrific, Lusine recalls. The strikes were a frightening disruption to Lusine's already fragile daily routine. The Nagorno-Karabakh region -- an enclave internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but home to a self-governing and predominantly ethnic Armenian population -- had been under an Azerbaijani blockade for more than nine months. The resulting humanitarian crisis was dire, and months of contending with shortages of food and other essentials had left Lusine and her compatriots exhausted. As Azerbaijani troops blitzed the regional capital with drones and artillery, videos showing damage to Stepanakert's residential areas slowly began appearing online. Widespread Internet outages were hindering communication, leaving locals cut off from each other as the offensive unfolded around them. Within hours, Azerbaijani troops had broken through the front line and encircled several of Nagorno-Karabakh's strategic settlements. I do not know what is happening. I am at the university. They are bombing us, Larisa Nersisyan wrote in a message that reached The Beet's correspondent hours after the attack began. Larisa, a student, was in class at Artsakh State University at the time and could not get in contact with her loved ones. I do not know where my family members are. There is no connection here, she said. Nagorno-Karabakh's unrecognized government, the Republic of Artsakh, capitulated within 24 hours, announcing on September 20 that it had agreed to a ceasefire. In a televised speech, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev declared that Baku had restored its sovereignty with an iron fist. The fall of Nagorno-Karabakh did not actually happen overnight. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the region, which goes back decades, escalated into a full-blown war in the early 1990s and again in the fall of 2020. The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War lasted 44 days, ending with a Moscow-brokered ceasefire that saw Azerbaijan regain part of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent territories it had lost in the 1990s. To maintain the ceasefire, Russia deployed peacekeepers to the region. But this did not prevent intermittent skirmishes and tensions were rising again by 2022. That September, renewed hostilities along the border with Azerbaijan spilled over into towns in southeastern Armenia and left hundreds of soldiers dead. Just a few short weeks later, however, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan held talks with Azerbaijan's Aliyev in Prague, after which they released a joint statement recognizing the territorial integrity of each other's countries. According to Ahmad Alili, the director of the Baku-based Caucasus Policy Analysis Centre, this signaled to Azerbaijan that the recent flare-up had paid off. Then, in December, Baku-backed activists blocked the Lachin Corridor -- the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. The blockade left Karabakh residents stranded without access to essential supplies and services, paving the way for a humanitarian crisis. International calls to end the blockade poured in from the European Union, the United States, Russia, and the United Nations. But Baku ignored them, arguing that Nagorno-Karabakh was an internal affair. After Azerbaijan installed a checkpoint on the Lachin Corridor in April, Pashinyan condemned the move as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing. Nevertheless, the prime minister continued to reiterate Armenia's readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan -- with the caveat that any peace agreement must ensure the rights and security of Karabakh Armenians and provide international guarantees for direct talks between Baku and Stepanakert. Karabakh's human rights ombudsman, Gegham Stepanyan, reported the first death from starvation on August 15. In an interview with The Beet about a month later -- coincidentally on the very eve of Azerbaijan's lightning offensive -- Stepanyan said Nagorno-Karabakh was experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe. People are not able to find food for their families, he explained. We also face huge problems in the healthcare sphere ... All pharmacies are completely empty. All surgeries are suspended. Humanitarian aid supplies through the Lachin Corridor had also resumed that day for the first time since June 15. But Stepanyan warned that the deliveries were woefully inadequate. The 120,000 people of Nagorno-Karabakh, including 30,000 children, cannot rely on humanitarian aid for a long time, he underscored. A month into the Nagorno-Karabakh blockade, in January 2023, President Aliyev suggested that anyone unwilling to take Azerbaijani citizenship should leave the region. The road is not closed; it is open, he insisted. They can leave. No one will hinder them. At this juncture, the prospect of leaving Nagorno-Karabakh was unthinkable to most local Armenians. And this remained the case even as the humanitarian situation deteriorated in the spring and summer of 2023. Most of these people want to live here, Stepanyan told The Beet on September 18. They want to live in their homes. Everything they have is here. When interviewed in early September, both Lusine and Larisa said they and their families intended to stay. The bodies of those who lost their lives in the 44-Day War are here, Lusine said. Leaving would be like betraying them. They gave their lives for us to live here. After the war, this place became like a sanctuary. Larisa said she dreamed of buying an apartment in Krkjan, the Stepanakert neighborhood where her mother grew up. I have so many nice memories there. I used to have so much fun there as a child. That is probably why I would like to live there, she mused. A week before Azerbaijan's 24-hour offensive, political analyst Tigran Grigoryan, who heads the Regional Center for Democracy and Security in Yerevan, described the prospect of evacuations from the region as a worst-case, catastrophic scenario. That is one of the reasons nobody's talking about evacuation publicly. Nobody wants to legitimize this narrative because, for some actors, this might be like the easy solution, said Grigoryan. If this happens in the 21st century, with all the international principles, it would put an end to any notion of comprehensive goals in the South Caucasus, he added. It is impossible to talk about peace at the cost of one side. After the ceasefire announcement on September 20, Stepanyan reported that Azerbaijan's offensive had killed at least 200 people in Nagorno-Karabakh, including at least 10 civilians, and wounded more than 400 others. In turn, Azerbaijan's Health Ministry said that 192 Azerbaijani troops were killed and 511 wounded, adding that one Azerbaijani civilian also died in the hostilities. Overall, it is around 200 people -- 200 young people in 24 hours, Alili said, referring to Baku's losses. It shows that the Azerbaijani government wanted to finalize it as soon as possible. Violence, not diplomacy, has always determined key outcomes in the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, wrote Thomas De Waal, a Carnegie Europe senior fellow, in an article for Foreign Affairs. He argued that Azerbaijan's gains in the 2020 war had tilted international negotiations in Baku's favor. Then, Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine again changed the power dynamics in the South Caucasus. When the war in Ukraine started, one local observer told me Azerbaijan was like a young lady everyone wants to marry. And that was the case, said Olesya Vartanyan, Crisis Group's senior analyst for the South Caucasus region. Azerbaijan has become more important, not just for the European Union or some leaders in the Middle East, but also for Russia. This shift was on full display in the aftermath of Azerbaijan's 24-hour offensive. While the YOU.S. and E.YOU. expressed concern and condemned the attack, Armenia's purported key ally, Russia, demurred. Rebuffing accusations of inaction, Vladimir Putin's spokesman pointed to Yerevan's recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan, adding that Russian peacekeepers in the region were working night and day to help evacuate civilians. Kremlin press guidelines (obtained by Meduza) even instructed state-controlled media to shift the blame for the assault onto Armenia and its Western partners. Meanwhile, Armenian officials were sounding the alarm over the consequences of Azerbaijan's actions. Speaking at the YOU.N. General Assembly, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan described it as the final act of a tragedy aimed at the forced exodus of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. Indeed, despite Azerbaijani officials pledging to treat them as equal citizens, Karabakh Armenians feared reprisals and started fleeing the region en masse. On September 28, officials in Stepanakert announced that the Republic of Artsakh would formally dissolve itself as of January 1, 2024. By that point, more than 65,000 refugees had arrived in Armenia. In the days that followed, this number swelled to more than 100,000. And Armenia found itself dealing with a humanitarian crisis for which it was completely unprepared -- despite earlier claims that the country was ready to accommodate 40,000 displaced families. Most refugees we spoke to either had a temporary host family arrangement or nowhere to go at all, Eurasianet reported on September 29. There are people spending days and nights on the streets, and the hygiene conditions are really bad, said photographer Eugene Shalnov, who was covering the situation in the border town of Goris. They lost everything they had, and many blame Armenia for not supporting them, he added. Earlier, the Armenian government had announced that it would offer a one-time payment of 100,000 drams (about 256) to each displaced person and allocate 360 million drams (just under 1 million) to regional governors to purchase humanitarian aid for refugees. A YOU.N. mission arrived in Nagorno-Karabakh on October 1. But journalists were already reporting that the Stepanakert was a ghost town. According to Stepanyan, the last bus from Artsakh reached Goris that same day. Larisa and Lusine, meanwhile, had both made their way to Yerevan. The last days in Stepanakert were so chaotic. Everyone was waiting for fuel to be able to leave, Larisa recalled. (Amid the chaos, a massive explosion at a fuel warehouse near Stepanakert had killed at least 170 people.) Thankfully, my family and I are together. We are all healthy, and that is the most important part, said Lusine. I am living with my mom, dad, brother, sister-in-law, their eight-month-old child, my two sisters, and our grandmother. We are in a small apartment. On October 2, Azerbaijan's presidential office presented its reintegration plan for Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenians. But according to the YOU.N. mission's report, this population has dwindled to between 50 and 1,000 people. I think there is little doubt that we have seen the end of Nagorno-Karabakh as we knew it, said Laurence Broers, an associate fellow at Chatham House, in an interview with Meduza. The question now is whether there will be any Armenian presence left in the territory at all. Several international experts have suggested that the exodus of Karabakh Armenians constitutes the war crime of deportation or forcible transfer or even a crime against humanity. However, Azerbaijani officials have rejected any and all such accusations. We cannot accept accusations of ethnic cleansing or genocide, Hikmet Hajiyev, a diplomatic advisor to Azerbaijan's president, told AFP. We opened the gate and respected their civilians' freedom of movement, freedom of choice. Azerbaijan emphasizes that it is a civic nation, a multicultural nation that has cordial relations with different ethnic and religious minorities. But I think it is a stretch to imagine that Karabakh Armenians could feel safe, Broers told Meduza. There is a very distinct and specific history the Karabakh Armenians have been through. And that is why we have this discussion about security guarantees. According to Azerbaijan's reintegration plan, Baku pledges to ensure the rights and security of Karabakh Armenians who accept Azerbaijani citizenship. But after years of official rhetoric propagating dehumanizing stereotypes and hatred, experts remain skeptical. Armenophobia legitimized Aliyev's regime for decades because the image of the external enemy is what creates unity and neutralizes internal contradictions, said Bahruz Samadov, an Azerbaijani political activist and doctoral candidate at Charles University in Prague. Peaceful coexistence can only be possible if this deep hatred is changed, but I do not think official discourse needs this, he continued. In Azerbaijan, nationalism is the basis of the regime's legitimacy. They could not force us to live there, said Larisa. It would have been inhuman.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Until two weeks ago, the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh was home to the breakaway Republic of Artsakh.

Several weaponized drones hit the Homs Military Academy's courtyard where families were gathered with the new officers on Thursday, minutes after defense minister Ali Mahmoud Abbas had left. Syria declared three days of mourning. There have been no claims of responsibility for the attack. Syria's defence and foreign ministries blamed what they described as terrorist groups, without specifying further, and vowed to respond with full force. On Friday morning, coffins carrying victims and draped in the Syrian flag were sent out from the Homs Military Hospital. A military band played somberly and lined up troops gave the salute. At the scene, Abbas said the blood spilt was precious. Syria's health ministry said 89 people had been killed, including 31 women and five children. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports on the Syrian conflict, put the toll at above 120. Throughout the night and into the early morning on Friday, Syrian government troops blasted artillery shells into rebel-held territory in the northern provinces of Idlib and Aleppo, according to the Observatory and the civil defense group known as the White Helmets, which operate in opposition-held areas. At least 12 civilians have been killed in that bombardment, according to the Observatory. Authorities have cancelled group Friday prayers, fearing that mosques could be attacked. Thursday's strike was an unprecedented use of drones against government forces in the war, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and spiraled into a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. In June, a drone attacked Assad's hometown of Qardaha in the province of Latakia. But Thursday's attack involving a swarm of drones represented the deadliest and most coordinated use of the weapon yet against the government side.

The coronavirus is not the only pathogen that can cause symptoms that last months, or even years, after an initial infection is overcome, a new study published Friday in The Lancet's eClinicalMedicine suggests. In an analysis of data from 10,171 YOU.K. adults, the researchers found evidence of a long cold syndrome that can follow infection with a variety of common respiratory viruses, including common cold viruses and influenza. While some of the symptoms of long Covid and long colds overlapped, the study noted that people with long Covid were more likely to continue to experience lightheadedness, dizziness and problems with taste and smell; lingering long cold symptoms were more likely to include coughing, stomach pain and diarrhea. Experts said the new research could help shine a light on the types of long-lasting symptoms that come after recovery from an illness, including chronic fatigue syndrome. These syndromes are not a new phenomenon, but existing research has largely focused on people who survived a severe infection, often having been hospitalized, said the lead author, Giulia Vivaldi, a statistician and epidemiologist at Queen Mary University in London. The emergence of long Covid has shown us that people can be burdened with long-lasting symptoms regardless of the severity of their own infection, and our findings suggest that this may not be unique to SARS-CoV-2. A study published this year found that the percentage of patients who developed a long flu syndrome after having caught influenza was similar to that of patients who developed long Covid after SARS-CoV-2 infections. It is not yet clear why some people develop long-lasting symptoms after infections, Vivaldi said in an email. The study suggests that more severe illness -- whether from Covid or other respiratory infections -- can increase a person's risk of long illness. But, she added, we know that this is not the only driver of risk in long Covid, and so may not be the only driver of 'long colds' either. To take a closer look at whether respiratory viruses other than Covid might cause syndromes similar to long Covid, Vivaldi and her colleagues turned to a dataset called COVIDENCE UK, an ongoing population-based observational study of Covid-19. The researchers focused on participants not vaccinated against Covid who filled out a questionnaire in early 2021 about respiratory illnesses and long-lasting symptoms. Around 13 of the people in the study had been diagnosed with Covid at least four weeks before, and another 4.6 had been diagnosed with non-Covid acute respiratory infections, such as influenza, common cold, bronchitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and ear infection. People were more likely to develop post-infection syndromes if they had more severe symptoms during their initial infections, but long-lasting symptoms could develop even in those with milder courses of illness, the researchers found. The new findings are a step forward, showing that Covid is not alone in causing long-lasting symptoms, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. The study is rigorous and large, Schaffner said, adding that the findings might help researchers better understand how people develop post-infection syndromes, including chronic fatigue syndrome. No viral culprit has been identified yet as a because for chronic fatigue syndrome, but I have high hopes we will learn something useful, he added. People are looking for inflammatory markers that might indicate an immune response overreaction. Find those and then you can work back to see how a virus triggers that response. Long Covid research may offer a unique opportunity to help scientists better understand what leads to long-lasting symptoms in those who have developed post-infection syndromes related to other viruses and bacteria, said David Putrino, a professor of rehabilitation and human performance at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. That is both because so many people have developed long Covid and because it gives researchers a clear example of a virus' leading to long-lasting symptoms, Putrino said. Neither Schaffner nor Putrino were involved with the new research. Putrino has been involved with long Covid research since reports of lingering symptoms in Covid patients first emerged early in the pandemic. Last month, he co-authored a study, published in the journal Nature, identifying immune system differences in the blood of people who have long Covid and those who do not. A number of factors probably determine whether a post-infection syndrome develops, including genetics, the type of pathogen and whether a person was in good physical health before having encountered the pathogen, Putrino said. Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said the exact details of what goes wrong and triggers a post-infection syndrome have not been worked out yet. Most doctors, however, have seen patients with those kinds of long-lasting symptoms after acute infections, Covid or otherwise, said Ray, who was not involved with the new research. It is not an uncommon pattern, he said. Studies like this one, Ray said, make a good case for doing what you can to avoid being infected in the first place. It is good to be aware that there can be long-term consequences from these infections, he said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Study: Symptoms can persist for weeks after common respiratory infections like the common cold.

The death toll in India's Sikkim state has risen to 40 after heavy rainfall in the northeastern state caused a glacial lake to overflow and flood surrounding areas with ice-cold water. In one of the worst disasters in the region in 50 years, the floods washed away houses and bridges, and forced thousands of people to leave their homes on Wednesday. Damage to key infrastructure and continuous rainfall has cut off the capital city, Gangtok, and made rescue operations more difficult. Fifteen bridges in the state have been washed away, including all bridges downstream of an NHPC hydropower station Teesta-V, according to the Indian government. We are evacuating people through helicopters provided by the army and the air force, Vinay Bhushan Pathak, Sikkim state chief secretary, said on Friday. About 2,400 people have been rescued since Wednesday and 26 injured individuals were taken to hospitals. Rescue workers are still trying to locate almost 100 people, including 23 army personnel. Officials in the neighbouring downstream state of West Bengal told Reuters that emergency teams recovered another 22 bodies that had been washed away. A statement from West Bengal cited by the Press Trust of India also said that the bodies of four army soldiers had been found. However, it was not immediately clear whether they were among the 23 missing soldiers. One soldier who had been reported missing on Wednesday was later rescued by authorities, the army said in a statement. More than 22,000 people have been affected by the flood, prompting state authorities to set up 26 relief camps, according to the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority. About 7,600 people were in relief camps, Tseten Bhutia, a state official, told Reuters. The disaster came ahead of a popular festive and tourism season in the state, leaving nearly 3,000 tourists and 700 taxi drivers stranded, added Pathak. The army said they will use helicopters to try to evacuate 1,500 tourists when the weather improves. In a press conference on Thursday, Pathak said that the tourists were safe in Lachen and Lachung, while the army is also providing them with internet communication so they can advise friends and family that they are safe. He also added that there is no shortage of essential commodities but unsuitable weather conditions are hindering the National Crisis Committee from starting rescue operations. The weather department said Sikkim received 101mm (four inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels, unleashing floods worse than one in October 1968 in which an estimated 1,000 people were killed. We thought the water level would not rise as it was very low, but as the water was released from the dam, the levels started to rise slowly and after the dam burst our houses were washed away, said Keval Tamong, a Sikkim resident. Intense rainfall had caused the high-altitude Lhonak lake to burst and make a Sikkim dam collapse after rushing downstream on Wednesday. The south Lhonak lake has also been rising and putting pressure on the dam in recent years as a warming climate melts source glaciers. Areas affected by the flooding include Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin. Schools in four districts have also been ordered shut till Sunday, according to the state's education department.

We are worryingly witnessing an increased number of attacks on critical infrastructure, even in places which had been considered relatively safe to date, said Marysia Zapasnik, IRC's Ukraine Country Director. The previously ruined homes and power grids have not been fully repaired, while intense shelling and deaths caused by landmines and other unexploded ordnance are now a daily reality. As temperatures plummet, Ukraine will likely suffer from intensified barrages of missile strikes, and a more widespread destruction, she continued. The combination of ongoing conflict, destroyed infrastructure, and harsh weather conditions can make life incredibly tough for the people in affected areas. At least 51 civilians were killed Thursday in a Russian rocket strike on a village store in Groza, eastern Ukraine, one of the deadliest attacks in recent months. The attack, which killed a child, happened on the sidelines of a Ukrainian soldier's funeral. Zelenskyy denounced the attack on the store and cafe in the village of Hroza as a demonstrably brutal Russian crime and a completely deliberate act of terrorism. He urged Western allies to help strengthen Ukraine's air defences, saying that Russian terror must be stopped. Russia's president claimed on Thursday that the plane crash which killed Yevgeny Prigozhin was caused by a hand grenade denoting. He suggested the mercenary boss may have also been on drugs. Notorious Prigozhin died when his private plane crashed on 23 August, two months after he launched an abortive mutiny against the Kremlin. In his first comments since the crash, Putin suggested the plane was blown up from inside, saying the head of Russia's investigative committee had reported to him a few days ago. Fragments of hand grenades were found in the bodies of those killed in the crash, Putin told a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club think-tank in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. There was no external impact on the plane - this is already an established fact, Putin said, challenging Western reports the aircraft was shot down. Putin did not elaborate on how grenades could go off onboard but implied drugs and alcohol might have been involved. Unfortunately, no examination was carried out to determine the presence of alcohol or drugs in the blood of the victims, Putin said. He said that in searches of Wagner's offices in St. Petersburg, the FSB security service had found 10 billion roubles (100 million) in cash and 5 kg (11 pounds) of cocaine. Prigozhin's mutiny was one of the most serious challenges to Putin's rule since coming to power in 1999. His guns for hire briefly captured the southern city of Rostov, a key military hub for Russia's campaign in Ukraine, and marched on Moscow. It was called off in a secretive deal brokered by Belarus, though Western diplomats say it exposed strains on Russia of the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has rejected as an absolute lie the suggestion that Putin had Prigozhin killed in revenge. Russia claimed to have shot down eight Ukrainian drones in western Russia on Thursday evening, without mentioning any possible damage or injuries. All were intercepted by Russian air defences over the Belgorod and Kursk regions. Since Kyiv began its counter-offensive in June, Russia has accused Ukraine of attacking its territory with drones or shells on an almost daily basis. Bar some exceptions, most strikes lack a clear military objective and almost always because no casualties or damage, especially when they are often intercepted by Russian air defences. But experts told Euronews in September there were key strategic objectives behind Kyiv's drone war against Russia.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"International Rescue Committee warns of increase in Russian strikes.

Against the backdrop of such attacks, the British Foreign Office said in a statement Wednesday that Russia wants to deter the export of Ukrainian grain by covertly targeting cargo ships. Information declassified today shows Russia may continue to target civilian shipping in the Black Sea, including by laying sea mines in the approach to Ukrainian ports, it said. Russia almost certainly wants to avoid openly sinking civilian ships, instead falsely laying blame on Ukraine for any attacks against civilian vessels in the Black Sea. Ukraine says it has, indeed, seen Russia laying more mines in the Black Sea, said Andrii Chernyak, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence agency. The Russian warships cannot get close enough to the Ukrainian coastline, as they are afraid of being hit by our missiles, he said. So they have really put efforts to mine the sea to the maximum, as they still aim to make navigation in the Black Sea impossible. Part of the reason the Black Sea is so important is that Kyiv has traditionally used it to export grain and other agricultural products, of which it is one of the world's top producers and sellers. Russia abandoned a deal in July that allowed Ukraine to export food products, hiking international food prices and threatening a hunger crisis in some of the poorest parts of the world. Since then, Ukraine has set up a humanitarian corridor, defying the de facto Russian blockade. And it is that corridor that the British Foreign Office says Russia seeks to target. The world is watching -- and we see right through Russia's cynical attempts to lay blame on Ukraine for their attacks, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in the statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Spain on Thursday rallying support from European leaders at a summit he said would focus on joint work for global food security and protection of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea. Russia has consistently denied targeting civilians, but it has a well-documented record of carrying out attacks on civilian and nonmilitary infrastructure in Ukraine, as well as in previous conflicts in Syria, Georgia and Chechnya. The Russian Defense Ministry has not responded to a request for comment about the British allegations. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual keynote foreign policy event, in the Russian city of Sochi, which is also on the Black Sea. Putin has suffered setbacks in the area after a series of high-profile attacks by Ukraine since August. Kyiv claims to have damaged several ships and a submarine and injured or killed dozens of officers. The commander of the Russian fleet was, however, shown in video a day after Ukraine claimed he had been killed. Ukraine's success in the Battle of the Black Sea is all the more remarkable as the country does not currently have a functioning navy, the Atlantic Council wrote in a briefing Wednesday. Instead, Ukraine has relied on daring commando raids along with a combination of domestically produced drones and long-range cruise missiles provided by the country's Western partners. Despite the limited arsenal, the attacks have been deployed with the kind of ingenuity that has become the calling card of the Ukrainian military, it said. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Black Sea Fleet had withdrawn the bulk of its ships from its main base in Sevastopol, in the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which Russia occupied in 2014, to its base in Novorossiysk, a port on the Russian mainland. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday that he could not comment on the report and that it was a matter for the Defense Ministry, which has not responded to a request for comment.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The British Foreign Office says Russia may continue to target civilian shipping in the Black Sea.

The reality check from across the Capitol could weigh on GOP lawmakers as they grapple with who should replace Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker. A band of far-right rebels led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., removed him from the position Tuesday, freezing the chamber. The eight Republicans who voted to boot McCarthy complained that he relied on Democrats to keep the government open and failed to advance their conservative policy priorities. But any new Republican speaker will inherit the divided government that befell the last one, as fears grow about how to prevent a shutdown on November 17, approve new aid to Ukraine and advance other must-pass bills to keep agencies functioning. McCarthy spent his nine months as speaker dancing on a knife edge of functionality and paralysis, constantly struggling to balance the demands of his aggressive right flank and the necessity of dealing with a Senate and a White House run by Democrats. So you get more conservative and that attracts more liberals to work with you on consensus policy? Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said of the House in jest. I have not read that book. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said the eight rebels who ousted McCarthy, as well as others in the House GOP, should remember who controls the rest of the government. To keep the government funded or to do anything consequential around here, they are going to have to get Democrats. So that is the dilemma they have. And as they select a speaker, I think they are going to have to think through that, Thune said. I do not know how these eight people are going to play into the speaker's race or what impact they might have, he said. But at the end of the day, whoever is leading the House on the Republican side is going to have to figure out how to do basic things. Democrats -- including red-state senators facing re-election -- have similar warnings about what the House is doing. They need to elect somebody that will work with both parties, said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. If the lesson here is you move further to the right to get things done, that makes no sense. ... Who comes up with stuff like that? I do not understand the logic of any of that. All I know is people hate Washington when it does stupid things like that. Referring to McCarthy's short-term bill to prevent a government shutdown, Brown said: If they do it the way they did last weekend and they are willing to work with Democrats, then it will work. And that is what I hope happens on a rail bill, what happens on RECOUP a bill to claw back bank executives' compensation and what happens on other issues. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said that the chaos in the House makes governing harder but that the Senate would moderate any extreme legislation it were to pass. I cannot see how this makes it better, Tester said. But who knows? It is been kind of a s--- show there for nine or 10 months. They might get their poop in a pile and things average out here. So far, two candidates have jumped into the fray for speaker: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Neither has the votes to win at this stage as Republicans are beginning to choose sides. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he has only one piece of advice for House Republicans in picking a new speaker: I hope whoever the next speaker is gets rid of the motion to vacate. I think it makes the speaker's job impossible, and the American people expect us to have a functioning government. In an interview Thursday, Jordan, who has a long history as a right-wing firebrand, was noncommittal on the motion-to-vacate rule and downplayed the prospects of further YOU.S. aid to Ukraine without a clear sense of the endgame for defeating Russia. What is the objective? he asked. What is the goal? Gaetz told NBC News he was thrilled that Scalise and Jordan were the two options at the moment. I am certain that under the stewardship of either Mr. Scalise or Mr. Jordan, the House of Representatives will be in far better stead than we were with Mr. McCarthy, he said. Asked what they could do that McCarthy could not, Gaetz said they would pass the Republican appropriations bills that include a host of spending cuts and conservative policy provisions. But those bills have no chance of passing the Senate, which could revive the same anxiety that led to McCarthy's ouster. There is little recognition of that political reality among a narrow but influential group of House hard-liners. In an interview Thursday, Jordan struggled to explain how he would have been able to avoid a shutdown without relying on Democrats had he been in McCarthy's spot last week. His argument rested on the belief that with McCarthy, the dislike among some conservative members toward him was personal -- and that he would not have that problem. Yeah, but you are assuming that I cannot bring the Republicans together. I think that is why I am running. Someone is got to be able to bring a Republican team together, he said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said: Let me say this to the next speaker of the House, whomever that may be. Think carefully about what happened to your predecessors before trying to coddle the hard right. Each of your predecessors got burnt each time. I urge the next speaker not to make the same mistake, not just for their own future, but for the country's. Whomever the house elects as speaker will not be able to ignore the realities of divided government, no matter what the hard right demands. Some GOP senators are pleading with them to see political reality. I do not have a lot of advice for my House colleagues, other than this: Follow your heart, but take your brain with you. The American people expect us to govern, said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. I would also advise all of my House colleagues to be sure to take your meds.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Senators warn that electing a more right-leaning speaker would not be enough.

Jerilee Bennett  AP Authorities in Colorado say they are investigating after bodies were found being improperly stored at a building owned by a funeral home that is known for offering green burials. Deputies were first dispatched to a building in Penrose, Colorado, on Tuesday to investigate reports of a suspicious incident, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office said in a news release Thursday. When they arrived, they learned the building was owned by the Return to Nature Funeral Home based in Colorado Springs, it said. The following day, the sheriff's office executed a search warrant at the property, along with the Fremont County Coroner's Office and the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, and found human remains were being improperly stored at the site. The sheriff's office did not state what condition the bodies were in, but said a criminal investigation was underway. The Return to Nature Funeral Home did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment from NBC News. Overnight phone calls to a line that the funeral home states is available 24 hours a day also went unanswered and the voicemail inbox was full. On its website, the funeral home says its Mission has ALWAYS been Green Burial. Green Burial is a natural way of caring for your loved one with minimal environmental impact, the website states, adding: Green Burial aids in the conservation of natural resources, reduction of carbon emissions and the preservation of habitat, WITHOUT the use of harsh embalming chemicals, metallic, plastic or unnatural items. Under Colorado law, green burials are legal, but remains that are not buried within 24 hours must be properly refrigerated. The funeral home appears to reflect this on its website, stating: In the state of Colorado within 24 hours the body must be either embalmed or placed in a regulated temperature controlled environment, meaning under refrigeration, dry ice, etc... Nearby residents told The Associated Press that a putrid smell had emanated from the building. We just assumed it was a dead animal, Joyce Pavetti, 73, told the news agency. She said she saw lights from law enforcement swarming the building Wednesday night and knew something was amiss. The sheriff's office said it was working with the Fremont County Coroners' Office, The Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, the Colorado Department of Public Health, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to investigate the matter. The sheriff's office asked that family members of deceased loved ones left in the care of the funeral home contact them by email at 23-1941fremontso.com or by phone through the Fremont Emergency Management call line at (719)-276-7421. This is an active investigation with resources being brought in from several different agencies, it said. The sheriff's office said media inquiries would not be responded to, but that a news conference will be held at the sheriff's office on Friday at 10 a.m. local time (12 p.m. ET.)",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Deputies were first dispatched to a building in Penrose, Colorado, on Tuesday to investigate reports of a suspicious incident.

The 'ticking time bomb' finally went off in the early hours of October 4, when a cloudburst event triggered its explosion. Water came rushing downstream, destroying everything that stood in its wake. Two days have passed since disaster struck but the Eastern Himalayan state of Sikkim very much remains in the clutches of floods and inclement weather. Amid the torrential rains that continue ravaging the state, the death toll has risen to 21 compared to 14 yesterday. Of the 23 army officials that went missing in the Burdang area, seven bodies were recovered from different locations downstream while one of them has been rescued. The search is on for the other 15 jawans. Apart from the army officials, at least 103 people remain missing, primarily from the Mangan, Pakyong, Namchi and Gangtok districts. Meanwhile, the overflowing Teesta river has caused massive damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. In fact, 11 bridges in the state were destroyed, of which eight were washed away in the Mangan district alone. With a massive section of NH10 caving in, over 3,000 people have been left stranded in Lachen and Lachung. Despite the army establishing a telecommunication facility to allow stranded tourists to speak to their worried families, prevailing bad weather over Sikkim continues to hamper operations. Today, a 25-member NDRF team carrying communication equipment, including several satellite phones, failed to land in Chungthang due to the unfavourable weather conditions. A defence spokesperson said the Army's Trishakti Corps had managed to save hundreds of tourists and locals and install them in the multiple relief centres set up across the state. As many as 26 relief camps have been set up in different areas, where the Indian Army is providing food, medical aid and any other required assistance. In light of the grim situation, Sikkim's education department announced that all government and private institutes will remain closed state-wide until October 15. Meanwhile, the release of both instalments of the Center's share of State Disaster Response Fund to Sikkim, amounting to Rs 44.80 crores in advance for the year 2023-24, has been approved to help the state in providing relief measures to the affected people.

Matt Gaetz led an effort to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker, Gaetz and Rep. Matt Rosendale, a fellow Freedom Caucus member, denounced as a political stunt Republicans' high-stakes effort to impeach President Joe Biden, according to a video obtained by NBC News. At an invitation-only fundraiser held over Zoom last week, Gaetz, R-Fla., and Rosendale, who is said to be plotting another Senate run next year, heaped skepticism on the probe. I do not believe that we are endeavoring upon a legitimate impeachment of Joe Biden, Gaetz told Steve Bannon, a podcaster and onetime political adviser to former President Donald Trump, who was moderating the discussion. They are trying to engage in a, like, 'forever war' of impeachment, Gaetz said. And like many of our forever wars, it will drag on forever and end in a bloody draw. As they fielded questions from high-dollar conservative donors, Gaetz and Rosendale were just days away from moving to end McCarthy's speakership -- and tipping the Republican caucus into its own protracted battle over who will lead the conference. Gaetz, Rosendale and the small faction of Republicans who ousted McCarthy, R-Calif., still hold tremendous leverage as the House tries to find a replacement. Whether the group could seek to use that leverage to extract concessions from the future speaker -- including how the House proceeds on issues like impeachment -- is yet to be seen. One of the impeachment leaders is also a candidate for speaker, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. During the fundraiser, Rosendale joined Gaetz in denouncing the Republicans' hotly tipped impeachment inquiry. Rosendale likened Congress' probe of Biden to the federal indictment of the president's son Hunter, which critics say has been tainted by preferential treatment and argue is a smokescreen intended to deflect attention from more serious crimes they accuse Hunter Biden of having committed, like working for foreign interests to influence YOU.S. policy. They are doing the exact same thing, Rosendale said. Gaetz said: I just do not get the sense that it is for the sake of impeachment. I think it is for the sake of having another bad thing to say about Joe Biden. While Republicans have largely united behind the effort, some misgivings have emerged despite Rep. James Comer's declaration that the probe had uncovered a mountain of evidence that Joe Biden had leveraged his position in office for his family's gain. Still, in the video, Gaetz told the attendees he meant no offense to Jordan or Comer, R-Ky., the chair of the Oversight Committee, who are overseeing the closely watched probes. But, he added, according to the recording, if this was serious, we would have sent a subpoena to Hunter Biden. Billed as an exclusive briefing on federal funding, according to an invitation seen by NBC News, the event took place Sept. 26 as Congress appeared to be careening toward a government shutdown -- a funding fight led by Gaetz and a band of hard-line allies against McCarthy. At the time of the event, Gaetz was days away from launching the effort to unseat McCarthy. Rosendale voted with Gaetz and six other Republicans to oust McCarthy. Gaetz's and Rosendale's remarks are sure to prompt scrutiny as attention mounts on the speakership battle and on where conservative loyalties will fall. In addition to Jordan, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., is also running for the speaker's job. Filing the vacancy comes with the potential of a drawn-out conflict between conservative factions. Gaetz has criticized the impeachment inquiry before. But underpinning the remarks is the tension of whether the sentiment could play into Gaetz's and Rosendale's support for Jordan in the speaker's race. Asked about his remarks, Gaetz told NBC News: Kevin was not serious. Jim Jordan is. Rosendale did not respond to a request for comment. Gaetz is also contending with backlash among fellow Republicans, who are angry he triggered the vote that allowed eight Republicans to join all of the Democrats to oust McCarthy. Some Republicans have called for expelling Gaetz from the Republican Conference. Jordan said he would not support such a move in an interview Thursday. NBC News obtained the full video of the event, which Bannon hosted alongside Caroline Wren, a Republican fundraiser who helped organize Trump's rally near the White House on January 6, 2021. While Gaetz's remarks about the impeachment inquiry have not previously been reported, other remarks at the fundraiser had been made public. During the event, Wren detailed a conversation in which she advised a wealthy donor to leverage a campaign donation to pressure a Gaetz ally who appeared to be wavering about whether to oppose a stopgap funding measure to keep the government open, The Daily Beast reported. At the same event, Rosendale admitted praying that Republicans in the House would have a large majority after the 2022 midterms, the news site The Messenger reported. The small majority has given rebels like Rosendale and Gaetz more leverage. Rosendale did not respond to a request from The Messenger for comment.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Rep.

A major clash in the disputed waters could potentially involve the United States, which has vowed to defend the Philippines, its treaty ally, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under armed attack.

A collision was averted when one of the two Philippine coast guard vessels, the BRP Sindangan, rapidly reversed its engine to avoid slamming into the Chinese coast guard ship that crossed its bow at a distance of only a meter, Tarriela said.

A ski boot warmer stored in luggage sparked a bomb scare at Queenstown Airport that prompted an evacuation and emergency response on Friday morning. Airport chief executive Glen Sowry said the electrical device was spotted during screening of checked luggage about 8.40am. It sat under other dense material inside a bag alongside a computer and had wires hanging from it. Aviation Security staff had a close inspection and determined that it was a serious concern, he said. Police examined the image and contacted the New Zealand Defence Force, which also believed the object was suspicious and flew its Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit to the airport by helicopter from Christchurch. The unit deemed the reported items posed no threat, and the airport reopened at 3pm. Throughout the day, about 25 flights were disrupted or cancelled. Sowry said airlines were scheduling extra domestic and international flights over the weekend to get people to their destinations. I think it will take most of the weekend to be able to work through this, he said. About 250 passengers were taken by bus to the Queenstown Events Centre, near the airport, and were provided with food, drinks and activities until the airport reopened. Queenstown Airport thanked members of the public for their patience and understanding. The police cordon had been lifted and passengers were free to collect luggage and vehicles, while those with a confirmed flight reservation were also requested to come to the airport. If you have been impacted and do not have a confirmed booking, please contact your airline, was the authorities advice. The airport had been evacuated, and its emergency security protocols activated, with passengers taken by bus to a secure location earlier on Friday. At 11am, Queenstown Airport said it would likely take several hours while authorities worked through the risk assessment process. Food and shelter had been arranged for passengers who required it at the Queenstown Event Centre. Queenstown Lakes District mayor Glyn Lewers said the the event centre had accommodated approximately 200 passengers that were evacuated. Lewers said about 11.30am they were waiting for the Defence Force to arrive from Christchurch. Police advised people to avoid the airport and there were no flights in or out of Queenstown during the incident. Do you know more? Email newsroomstuff.co.nz Further updates on flight details were to be provided on the Queenstown Airport Facebook page. Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said due to the incident, four inbound flights had been cancelled, and one flight had returned to Christchurch. Six outbound flights from Queenstown had also been cancelled. They were flights to Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. We apologise to our passengers for the disruption, especially as this has happened at the end of the busy school holidays period. Safety is our number one priority, and we are working with the relevant authorities, Morgan said. A Jetstar spokesperson said two flights have been affected by the incident so far. Wnaka resident Hayley Barbour said her mother-in-law, also from Wnaka, had her flight cancelled and was waiting in the rain with other passengers in one of the airport's car parks, about 10.30am, as they were being moved by bus to the event centre. Barbour said they had been advised that the delays would be a few hours. Louella, her mother-in-law, was catching a flight on her way to her great-niece's wedding tomorrow, and had caught an early bus from Wnaka to the airport, to make sure she was on time. But one hour later, Barbour said Air New Zealand had been amazing and Louella was booked on another flight tomorrow morning to get to the wedding. It was a shame that the family had got more information from Facebook than the airport had given to passengers waiting outside, she said. A person who walked past the airport said police were everywhere. Tom Clarke and Luisa Navanteri, a couple from Sydney, were waiting at the airport for a flight that was supposed to leave at 2.25pm and had been pushed back to 3.30pm. They had been in Queenstown for a week on holiday and said they presumed that the flight was still going ahead. When they arrived at the airport, they were told nothing and said security was just as much in the dark. We have just been waiting here, Navanteri said. They had heard there was a bomb threat but were waiting around to see if there would be an update. Clarke said it was a little bit frustrating but it is just one of those things. NZ 'dark pop' singer and songwriter Michele Ducray was supposed to be on her way up to Auckland to promote the release of her new EP Throne of Mine when she was moved away from the airport by security. When I was walking up to the airport, security just started rushing everyone out and mass crowds started forming, Ducray said. She was told to go to the field by the 'welcome to the airport' sign and confirmed security were in the dark about the situation as well. It was not until everybody went online that they found out it was a bomb threat, she said. Ducray said everybody felt confused and inconvenienced.

Tobacco growing - the base from which Virginia was settled - is shrinking fast. There were just 306 Virginia tobacco farms in 2017, the latest year for which figures are available, down from 895 in 2007 and 6,067 in 1997. That was a year before the Master Tobacco Settlement in which tobacco companies agreed to pay states billions of dollars per year to settle state lawsuits that sought to recover health care costs related to tobacco illnesses. Tobacco was the leading cash crop in Virginia as late as 2003 before falling behind crops such as tomatoes, soybeans and corn. Tobacco no longer is among Virginia's top 10 agricultural products in cash receipts for farms, ranking far behind commodities such as chickens raised for meat production, cattle and calves, turkeys, dairy products and soybeans. But in 2022 tobacco products were among Virginia's top five agricultural and forestry exports at 215 million. Some 137 miles up the road, Altria Group's big Philip Morris USA plant in South Richmond makes billions of cigarettes in a plant the size of a football field, filled with a modern version of the nearly 150-year-old Bonsack machine that first mass produced cigarettes made out of that Old Belt leaf. Most of the tobacco those machines roll into the tubes of flimsy thin cigarettes that fly through their works is still from the Virginia and North Carolina Old Belt. Far fewer people smoke these days - 50 years ago, more than 4 out of 10 American adults smoked; these days, it is more like 1 out of 9. While the Richmond plant still churns out the nation's most popular cigarette - Marlboro, which accounts for more than 40 of the YOU.S. cigarette market and more than half of the largest, non-discount, segment of that market - it is also making Altria's new on! brand pouches of tobacco-derived nicotine. Finding alternatives The plant will also run a pilot line of tobacco capsules that would be heated in a hand-held device similar to an e-cigarette. The capsules would deliver something that tastes more like a cigarette than vaping does, but it would not look as much like cigarettes as the new Marlboro-like sticks that the Richmond center will also make for Altria's joint venture with Japan Tobacco to market that firm's heating device with Marlboro-style sticks. Finding alternatives to burning tobacco in a cigarette - which generates more than 90 cancer-causing and toxic gases and particles - is where Henrico County-based Altria sees its future, chief executive office Billy Gifford told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. We are not interested in attracting people to cigarettes, Gifford says. What we know is about half of adult smokers are interested in an alternative, some way to safely enjoy tobacco. Public health advocates are skeptical. Many doubt Altria and other tobacco firms' promises that they want to make products that reduce the harm tobacco use causes. Some believe cigarette makers really want to increase the number of people addicted to the nicotine in tobacco. I think it is greenwashing, said Chris Bostic, policy director of Action on Smoking and Health. If they really wanted harm reduction they would stop making combustibles. While the master settlement pushed cigarette prices higher, encouraging some smokers to quit, he said cigarette makers just turned to more effective marketing efforts, via social media. That also lowered the profile of a controversial industry to the wider world of those who do not smoke, easing public pressure on the companies. Virginians, including high school students, are more inclined to use tobacco than other Americans, according to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. It says 12.4 of adult Virginians smoke, compared with the national average of 11.5. It reports that 2.8 of Virginia high school students smoke and 11,100 minors a year try cigarettes. Health care costs in Virginia for smoking-related diseases total 3.6 billion annually, the campaign said. The 11.9 million Virginia spent on tobacco use prevention efforts was just 13 of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend. The shift in focus started with the Master Tobacco Settlement, 25 years old next month, under which Altria and other cigarette makers pay billions of dollars a year to states. Formally, the idea was to reimburse states for Medicaid programs' expenses in caring for smokers. In addition, the settlement forced up the price of a pack to levels that discouraged many smokers - and pulled back on ads and marketing efforts. The master settlement, it was really about saying to society we are going to reduce underage smoking, but with it we saw that the adult smoker was interested in alternatives. ... We have been at this for a while, Gifford said. The grower The tobacco world is changing. Thompson is one face of that. He is not a farm kid. And he only started raising tobacco 11 years ago - some seven years after many older growers in Virginia, as in other tobacco states, took the YOU.S. Department of Agriculture buyout of their quotas, a price support mechanism that in many cases their fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers acquired back in the 1930s, and stopped growing tobacco. Ending the quota ended the government-sponsored safety net: the Flue Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corp. It would buy tobacco at a price that aimed to cover growers' costs and the work they put in their crop if they could not get that at the warehouse auctions that were how leaf was sold. Ending the quota also ended the USDA's tobacco grading service - the impartial judges who could look at a 300-pound pile of leaf and set standardized ratings detailing stalk position - lugs, cutters, leaf of tips - color and body - the feel of a cured leaf that gave a good indication of sugar and nicotine content. These days, Thompson and other growers negotiate contracts directly with buyers. That usually happens around the time in February that Thompson and his helpers will be bent over ice cube-like trays of potting soil, carefully setting tiny pink tobacco seeds. It is finicky work. A line of 15 seeds will barely reach 18th of an inch. Contracting The contracts specify the pounds the grower is to deliver, and detail varieties to raise, and the stalk position - lugs, cutters, leaf or tips - the buyer wants. But when it is time to deliver, it is up to the buyer to say; he may say the color's not good, he does not like the body, the sugar or nicotine are not right, Thompson said. He may say he will not take it, he may offer you a reduced price. Buyers all have somewhat different preferences - and their preferences can evolve as they and their colleagues in other areas start bringing in tobacco. There is always a chance that bales that do not please one buyer a grower contracts with will be just the thing another is looking for. That is why Thompson, for instance, opted to arrange contracts with six different buyers this year. Some years, he gambled on raising more tobacco than he had contracts for, betting that the harvest in other tobacco growing areas might fall short - a hurricane hitting tobacco farms in the Carolinas in the big growing regions east of Interstate 95 could send buyers scrambling for leaf. But that is a big gamble, given a cost of about 5,000 an acre to raise tobacco on the Old Belt. There is special fertilizer, the cost of running his cultivar with its spiders - think rimless spoked wheels - to pull and cover weeds, and above all the wages growers pay people to pull leaf. Labor is 65 of a typical grower's cost. For the most part, those wages go to seasonal workers admitted for temporary stays with an H2A visa, with minimum wages dictated by the YOU.S. Department of Labor. This year, for people working in Virginia fields, they rose by just over 5 to 14.91; over the past five years, they have increased by nearly 22. Thompson opts for people to pick his leaf instead of the mechanical harvesters some growers use. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  Stitcher  RSS Feed  Omny Studio You need people to say if a leaf is ripe or not, he said. You get a lot cleaner bale, too - no weeds or trash - and buyers want clean. Growers can likely gross about 5,500 an acre from tobacco. As a margin over costs, it is not way out of line with soybeans raised on Old Belt soil - but beans might gross a farmer 500. Farms in Southside Virginia simply are not big enough for that kind of gross income per acre to yield enough money for anyone to be a full-time farmer. Shrinking As the number of Virginia growers and the acreage planted fell in the 25 years after the master settlement, the value of what they sold fell to 107.6 million from 187.4 million - but the average gross for the small number of growers who kept raising tobacco rose to 352,000 from just under 32,000. Margins are squeezed, though. Under the settlement, from 1998 to 2022 cigarette makers had paid 159 billion and those payments are to continue as long as the companies sell tobacco products. States were free to use the funds as they chose, though the settlement urged them to step up spending on tobacco control and prevention programs. Last year, states used about 11 of the 6.38 billion of settlement payments they received for prevention and control efforts. Virginia has so far received more than 3 billion. It used the promise of future payments to issue bonds, and invested the proceeds. Half of the income from those investments funds the state's Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission's efforts to ease the impact of falling tobacco sales on farmers and the towns that long depended on tobacco growers' income. The commission paid growers some 479 million to compensate them for losses they suffered as the YOU.S. Department of Agriculture cut tobacco quotas - the limits on the amount of tobacco they could sell - before USDA ended the program altogether by buying back quotas for 7 a pound (with 3 more for growers who held quotas). Many producers used the money to pay off debt and keep their farms running while they shifted to other crops - but the big notion that they could grow vegetables never really panned out. The processing, distribution and marketing systems that are needed to attract interest from supermarket chains did not come. On top of that, soils in the Old Belt are not the most fertile. That is good for tobacco, because it forces the plant to ripen quickly once its white or lavender-colored flowers are pulled off - topped as growers say. Other crops do not do as well. Fewer cigarettes Growing tobacco is shrinking. So is smoking. The fraction of American adults who smoke cigarettes fell to 12.5 as of 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An additional 3.7 used e-cigarettes, 2.3 used smokeless tobacco - dip, snuff or snus - and 3.5 smoked cigars. Just 2 of high school students smoked cigarettes. In 1997, 37.7 of high school boys and 34.7 of girls smoked cigarettes - more than double those numbers had tried it at some point, CDC reports show. But vaping is popular: 14.1 of high school students use e-cigarettes - devices that often use synthetic nicotine rather than the tobacco-derived compound. The year before the settlement, American tobacco companies sold 478.6 billion cigarettes, down sharply from the 1981 peak of 636.5 billion. But by 2020, the latest year for which data are available, sales had dropped to 203.7 billion, the Federal Trade Commission reported. The way the companies market cigarettes changed dramatically, too. Promotional allowances - basically, price discounts - already the biggest marketing expense in 1997, the year before the settlement, at 2.44 billion, have climbed to 7.47 billion. Meanwhile, the public presence of cigarettes almost disappeared. The companies stopped spending on sponsorships, endorsements, entertainment events, sampling and advertising in newspapers, while magazine advertising fell to 4.3 million from 237 million, billboards to 1.8 million from 295.3 million. Spending on point-of-sale store displays fell from 552.6 million to 47.1 million. The 1,600-strong field sales force at Henrico County-based tobacco giant Altria, manufacturer of the nation's No. 1 cigarette brand, Marlboro, who regularly visit stores with ideas for selling cigarettes, have also convinced 197,000 retailers to sign contracts requiring them to post We Card signs. The signs warn buyers they may have to prove they are over 21 if they want to buy cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars or oral tobacco. Altria signed up more than 137,000 stores for a scanner and software system based on an electronic scan of a consumer's government-issued identification, such as a driver's license, to purchase any tobacco product. When a sales clerk scans a tobacco product for a sale, the system requires a scan of a driver's license or similar ID before the transaction can continue. The scanner includes software that can confirm that the ID has not expired and that buyer is over 21. Making cigarettes - and other items At Altria's Richmond Manufacturing Center, its 1,700 employees are not only running the machines that make 75 billion Marlboro cigarettes a year. They also produce more than 90 of one of the new products - on!, pouches with tobacco-derived nicotine and plant fiber, said Scott Myers, president and chief executive officer of Altria Group Sales and Distribution Co. A pilot line at the plant is making parts for another smoke-free product Altria is developing: a handheld device, called SWIC, that looks much like a vaping device, but that will heat a capsule of tobacco, inside of a liquid with either tobacco-derived or artificial nicotine, the addictive ingredient in tobacco plants. Those capsules are what the Richmond pilot line is making. SWIC is meant to appeal to tobacco users who want to inhale a stronger tobacco flavor than vaping liquids now deliver, but that does not look like a cigarette, which Altria thinks will appeal to smokers who might feel embarrassed when others see them smoking, or who worry others will be offended by that stale smell of smoke. Compared with cigarettes, SWIC prototypes are delivering low levels of the 93 chemicals that because cancer or lung disease, the company says. Altria scientists, engineers and marketers are still working on last-minute refinements to the device, but I think we are really close to delivering a final product, Altria chief operating officer Jody Begley has said. Altria, meanwhile, expects to file with the Food and Drug Administration in 2025 for preliminary permission to market a Richmond-made, Marlboro-based stick to be used with a heating device that Japan Tobacco has developed. The two tobacco giants have formed a joint venture to market a system comprising pint-sized cigarettes that fit into a handheld heating device. The idea here is to have a product that offers smokers some of the sensory signals that cigarettes do - the tapping of a cigarette on the pack, for instance, that for many is the preliminary to that first deep drag that the heated sticks also provide. Because the stick is heated, rather than burned, it does not create some of the chemicals and toxic carbon monoxide that cigarette smoke contains, Altria says. By pairing Japan Tobacco's device, already for sale in its market, with Marlboro-brand sticks, Begley says it should appeal to smokers who might be hesitant about trying something new. Flue-cured leaf Heated sticks mean opportunity for Old Belt growers, because they would need the same high-quality flue-cured or bright tobacco grown along the Virginia-North Carolina line - and maybe even proportionally more, said Stephen Barts, a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent specializing in tobacco. Combustible cigarettes often use blends that include lower-quality leaf because Old Belt flue-cured tobacco can mask the taste of that leaf, whether imported from Brazil, Zimbabwe, Zambia or Malawi or from growers farther south on the lighter soils of coastal plain North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, Barts said. But heated tobacco sticks are smaller than cigarettes and use less tobacco overall. Bright tobacco makes up about three quarters of the leaf in an American-style cigarette and all of the leaf in British or Canadian-style brands. American-style cigarettes also use burley tobacco, a variety still grown in Southwest Virginia but mainly in Kentucky, and oriental style leaf, which is usually imported from Turkey or the Balkans. Oral tobacco and the advanced products, such as pouches, use a different kind of tobacco, like the dark air-cured and dark fire-cured leaf that is still grown in Charlotte County. As fewer Americans smoke, and with dark tobacco in demand for two of the main alternatives to cigarettes - oral tobacco and pouches, overseas buying of flue-cured tobacco - from China, notably - has become the mainstay of Old Belt growers, Barts said. We are an export market, he said. There are more smokers in China than people in the United States. Vaping advice: How to help kids dodge cigarette, vaping, and pot marketing and stay smoke-free  Whether or not you smoke cigarettes or support legalizing marijuana, you probably do not want your kids lighting up. But the rise of e-cigs vaporizers like the Juul, and decriminalized pot may make your standard anti-smoking arguments -- it causes cancer, it is illegal -- feel a little shaky. Add in celebrities posting pictures of themselves smoking various substances, and you might wonder: Is it possible to raise drug-free, smoke-free kids in the era of Smoking 2.0? Yes, but it helps to have a little ammunition. Vaping is an especially tough one, because kids encounter tons of information about it online. According to a November 2019 survey conducted by Common Sense Media and SurveyMonkey: Vaping is popular among teens, and it is happening regularly at school. One-third of teens (33) say they see classmates vaping in school a few times a week or daily. More than half (54) say they see it monthly. Nearly eight in 10 (78) say vaping is popular among people their age where they live. Most teens think vaping is as harmful as smoking. Just over half of teens (52) say vaping is about as harmful as smoking, while 31 say it is more harmful and 17 say it is less harmful. Among those teens who say vaping is less harmful than smoking, 43 say they have gotten messages online telling them that vaping is healthier than smoking cigarettes. One in four teens first learned about vaping on social media. A plurality of teens (44) say they first learned or heard about vaping from someone they know, while 23 first heard about it on social media, 9 from TV or a movie, and less than that from outdoor ads, in a store, on a website, on the radio, or on a podcast. Vaping is common in teens' social media experiences. When thinking about their typical experience using social media, 59 of teens say they are likely to see a post that mentions or shows vaping. If you are feeling outspent, out-messaged, and out-cooled, take heart. There are plenty of ways to fight back. Here is how to help your kids resist the marketing of traditional cigarettes, vaporizers, e-cigs, and pot. TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES -- Explain how bad smoking is for you. Kids think they are immune and immortal. The death statistics could be eye-opening, even for the it will not happen to me age group. -- Talk about how addictive nicotine is. Nicotine is really difficult to quit. Discuss the signs of physical addiction and the risk of getting addicted. -- Help them resist gimmicks. Traditional cigarettes are trying to capture smoker interest by using kid-friendly tricks -- for example, the Camel Crush cigarettes with a menthol ball inside. But the cigarettes still really are bad for you. Explain that Big Tobacco just wants to addict you. When cigarette smoking declined, tobacco companies such as Altria bought the vaping company Juul. VAPORIZORS AND E-CIGS -- Share the facts. E-cigarettes and vapes reduce exposure to some of the harmful chemicals of tobacco cigarettes, but no one really knows the impact of these products on kids' health. And studies show they contain formaldehyde. -- Tell them to wait. Tell them it is important that they wait until their brains and bodies have developed fully before they consume something potentially harmful. -- Talk about addiction. Kids can get hooked on nicotine but also on the physical habit of reaching for a pipe. -- Get your doctor involved. Have your pediatrician talk to your kid about the dangers of ingesting any chemical you do not know much about. -- Help them see through the hype. Talk about marketing methods such as using celebrities and how companies try to make e-cigs seem as though they are healthier and better for the environment than tobacco cigarettes. -- Cite the death statistics. Dozens of people have died from vaping -- and many more have become sick. MARIJUANA Impart your values. Teens are still listening to their parents, despite much evidence to the contrary. Discuss what is important to you: good character, solid judgment, and belief in a bright future -- all of which are compromised by smoking pot. -- Explain the health consequences. Study after study indicates that pot negatively affects a teen's developing brain. -- Encourage waiting. For some kids, forbidding might backfire, so focus on preventing them from starting to smoke in the first place, delaying it as long as possible. -- Look for warning signs. Be on the lookout for things that might be affecting your kid in other areas of his or her life -- for example, social exclusion, school problems, and emotional instability. -- Pull back the curtain on pot marketing. Kids and teens do not like to be tricked, and advertising is full of sneaky ways to get people to buy a product, including branding pot products with names such as Bob Marley and Willie Nelson. Instead of lecturing, help your kids break down the ads to see how they try to influence emotions, choices, and behavior.

As the head-end locomotive traversed the gap, a train-initiated emergency brake application occurred. Shortly after, crew members observed a large explosion behind them as the head-end locomotive and first car separated from the train. Subsequent inspection determined that 33 cars derailed, of which 20 tank cars had breached, and the released product ignited, resulting in a large pool fire that burned for nearly 24 hours. There were no injuries, and no evacuation was required. The investigation determined that the south rail had likely failed under a previous train, causing an undetermined length of rail to break away and separate from the track and expose the rail ends. The condition of the track components (anchors, ties, and ballast) did not provide adequate resistance to the rail forces initiated by the cold weather at the time of the accident, which contributed to the breaking of the rail. Despite regular track visual inspections and ultrasonic rail flaw detection testing, which exceeded regulatory requirements, the broken rail went undetected before the arrival of the train. Although the train was operated in accordance with the Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes in place at the time of the occurrence, the train speed (44 mph) contributed to the number of cars that derailed, breached, and lost their product. If company risk assessments do not adequately consider increases in traffic tonnage, the use of heavier rail cars, and the potential for more rapidly degrading track structure, regular track maintenance activities may no longer be sufficient to maintain track to the required standards, increasing the risk of track infrastructure failures that lead to rail accidents. Since this occurrence, CP has implemented a number of safety measures including a wayside system for detecting rail breaks in non-signalled territory, such as the Sutherland Subdivision, increased its number of autonomous track geometry measuring systems, and upgraded the track infrastructure on the Sutherland Subdivision.

The vessel reportedly experienced an explosion at approximately 0920 UTC (GMT). The vessel dropped anchor for a short period to assess the damage, said security consultancy Ambrey in an update. At 1210, the vessel resumed sailing. The incident occured near the entrance to the Sulina Canal, a strategic waterway connecting the Black Sea to the Danube River. The canal is one of several key arteries for Ukraine's grain trade, and the anchorage near its entrance is perennially busy. Turkish shipping observer Yoruk Isik told Reuters that the vessel was the general cargo ship Kafkametler, and that the blast caused minor damage to a ballast tank. No injuries were reported. As of Thursday night, Kafkametler was anchored on the northern branch of the Danube River delta, near the Ukrainian port of Vylkove. Yesterday, UK defense intelligence warned that it had reason to believe that Russia may use sea mines to target civilian shipping on the approaches to Ukrainian ports, then blame the damage on Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine's port infrastructure for grain exports, seeking to damage its agricultural economy. Abkhazia allows Russia to build a new naval base Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia, has agreed to allow the Russian Navy to build a naval base on the territory under its control. We have signed an agreement, and in the near future there will be a permanent base of the Russian Navy in the Ochamchira district, said Aslan Bzhania, the head of Abkhazia's Russian-supported government, speaking to Russian state media on Wednesday. This kind of interaction will continue. There are also things I cannot talk about. In 2008, after NATO signaled that it would consider Georgia's application to join, Russian forces intervened in support of ethnic separatist groups in the border regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After several months of Russian preparation, the hostilities were over in two weeks. A ceasefire agreement required Georgia to withdraw troops from the regions; the Russian Army was supposed to withdraw as well, but expanded its presence on the ground with permanent base infrastructure. Though Abkhazia is democratically governed, Russia supplies most of its state budget, according to Freedom House. Only Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria recognize Abkhazia as a sovereign nation; all other UN member states consider it to be part of Georgia. Given the context, the Georgian government reacted angrily to Bzhania's announcement, calling it a flagrant violation of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. A base in Abkhazia would give the Russian Navy a new safe harbor, further away from Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has no seagoing naval fleet, but its unmanned surface drones, cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles have made the western half of the Black Sea a challenging operating environment for the Russian Navy. In response to repeated attacks, Russia has ceased naval patrols near the Ukrainian coast and withdrawn most of its fleet from Sevastopol to the port of Novorossiysk, on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. The functional defeat of the Black Sea fleet - and I would argue that is what it is because it has been forced to disperse to ports from which it cannot have an effect on Ukraine - is an enormous credit, said UK armed forces minister James Heappey on Thursday.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A cargo ship hit a mine off the coast of Romania, sustaining minor damage.

Details of the Lhonak Lake warning system have not previously been reported. Scientists and government authorities were working on an early warning system for glacial floods at a Himalayan lake in northeast India when it broke its banks this week with deadly consequences. Sikkim plunged into chaos on Wednesday as floods spurred by heavy rain and an avalanche killed at least 19 people. It was one of the worst disasters in the region in 50 years. The first part of the system, a camera to monitor Lhonak Lake's level and weather instruments, were installed last month, officials involved in the project told Reuters. If fully operational, the warning system could have given people more time to evacuate, scientists said. One scientist said glacial early warning systems can typically give residents a few minutes to an hour of notice. Details of the Lhonak Lake warning system have not previously been reported. It is quite absurd, really, said geoscientist Simon Allen of the University of Zurich who is involved with the project. The fact it happened just two weeks after our team was there was completely bad luck. He said they planned to add a tripwire sensor that would trigger if the lake was about to burst. That would typically be connected to an alert system or siren that would warn residents to immediately evacuate to higher ground. The Indian government was not prepared to do that this year, so it was being done as a two-step process, he said. The monitoring devices were supposed to send data to authorities, but the camera lost power for an unknown reason in late September, according to a source at the Swiss embassy, which supported the project. As climate change warms high mountain regions, many communities are facing dangerous glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Lakes holding water from melted glaciers can overfill after heavy rain and burst, sending torrents rushing down mountain valleys. More than 200 such lakes now pose a very high hazard to Himalayan communities in India, Pakistan, China, Nepal and Bhutan, according to 2022 research. In recent years, glacial flood early warning systems have been deployed in Nepal, Pakistan, and Bhutan. The early warning systems at Lhonak Lake, and another at nearby Shako Cho in Sikkim, were to be among the first in India for glacial lake outburst floods, sources told Reuters. Scientists have for years said the two lakes are at risk of outburst floods, but the design process and search for funding caused time to pass without progress. India plans to install early warning systems at several other glacial lakes, said Kamal Kishore, a senior official at India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). He did not answer further questions on the Lhonak project. However, Farooq Azam, a glaciologist at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore, noted that even if the system had been in place, the potential benefits were not clearcut. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Such kind of events are so fast that even if we have some kind of early warning system ... we may only gain some minutes, maybe an hour, he said.

A basket carrying relief supplies on a makeshift zip line across the Teesta river in SIkkim. NEW DELHI: India aims to install the first part of an early warning system at some high-risk glacial lakes in the Himalayas next year, a senior official said on Monday, as the country responds to deadly floods this month that killed at least 60 people. There are 56 at-risk glacial lakes in India and the urgency to monitor them was stepped up after Lhonak Lake in the eastern Himalayas burst its banks two weeks ago and caused widespread damage in Sikkim, a small mountainous state wedged between China, Nepal and Bhutan. Reuters was the first to report that India was working on a pilot project with Swiss experts to set up the country's first early warning systems at Lhonak Lake, and also at nearby Shako Cho lake. If the systems had been installed, they could have given 90 minutes warning before floods engulfed homes and structures. We will try some monitoring systems at lakes that are at risk, Krishna S. Vatsa, a member of India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), told Reuters. The NDMA is co-ordinating with Indian and international institutes for the project. State governments will provide recommendations on which of the 56 at-risk glacial lakes in India need to be prioritised for setting up the monitoring systems, Vatsa said. Vatsa said authorities will aim to set up some of these systems by next year to monitor the weather and environment at the lakes as a first component of an early warning system. The full system would be installed later based on the outcome of monitoring. He added though that this was easier said than done given the difficulty in reaching these lakes high in the mountains, which can be accessed only during summer months. Also, these will be unmanned systems running on solar or battery power. As climate change warms high mountain regions, many communities are facing dangerous glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Lakes holding water from melted glaciers can overfill and burst, sending torrents rushing down mountain valleys. More than 200 such lakes now pose a high hazard to Himalayan communities in India, Pakistan, China, Nepal and Bhutan, according to 2022 research, and India currently lags behind its South Asian neighbours in deploying glacial flood early warning systems. The Economic Times newspaper reported on Monday that top officials from multiple ministries will meet on Wednesday to formulate a plan for early warning systems.

Kolkata: From the daily struggles of autorickshaw drivers to trafficking and abuse of women to blatant use of child labour in hotels, Durga puja committees in Kolkata have highlighted different social issues to generate awareness among people this festive season. At Hazra Park Sarbojonin Durgotsav, one of the oldest pujas in the city, the hand-to-mouth survival tales of autorickshaw drivers have been narrated using replicas of the green and yellow three-wheelers adorning the marquee. To give it a real feel, real-life auto drivers will interact with pandal hoppers during the puja days. Sayandeb Chatterjee, spokesperson of the puja committee, said, From the familiar role of auto drivers competing against each other to net passengers and haggling for exact fares, we present their humane side, working 24x7 to feed their families while juggling roles as a parent, a spouse or a son. Though their daily earnings are meagre, they try to keep their families happy and put in all that they can for the good education of their kids, he added. Auto driver Sambhu Sana, who will be felicitated at the pandal on one of the festive days, said, We negotiate through the city streets and its alleys defying severe weather conditions. We ferry passengers from dawn till midnight. Many of us will be present at the pandal in the evening hours this time to interact with pandal hoppers.

As one enters the pandal, there are models of girls with chains tied to their feet, juxtaposed with models of girls holding books. We have tried to portray that despite hundreds of Durgas in our households being ill-treated, violated and abused, yet they aspire to defy all odds to realise their dreams, puja committee general secretary Somen Dutta said. The 'Pathuriaghata Pancher Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab' has chosen the theme 'Ritumati' (the issue of menstrual hygiene) to debunk prejudices and create social awareness. Ellora Saha, the working president of the puja committee, said, We sought to drive home the message that menstruation is a biological process of every young woman and they should not be made to feel shy, embarrassed, awkward to discuss it. The puja committee through various images drives home the lessons of personal health and hygiene for girls as well as educating boys to handle this issue with an open mind, she said. The puja committee took three months and Rs 18 lakh to make the pandal, she said. The Banerjee Para Pujo Committee at Shyamnagar in the northern fringes of the city has chosen the theme 'Haturi Noy Hate Khari, Sishu Shram Bandho Kori,'' (No use of hammers by children, let us give them chalks and dusters) through models and posters.

This event, organized by the rail industry and the British Transport Police, aims to educate individuals on how to recognize and intervene in such situations, as well as report incidents. The latest survey conducted by UN Women UK reveals that sexual harassment is a prevalent issue, with 71 of women in the UK having experienced it in public spaces. The VR film being screened illustrates how small actions, such as offering to change seats or diverting the attention of the perpetrator, can prevent incidents from escalating. It is crucial for everyone to play a role in reducing harm by reporting any witnessed incidents. British Transport Police can be contacted by texting 61016 or by using the Railway Guardian app. In emergency situations, always call 999. This event is part of wider initiatives to combat sexual harassment within the public transport system. Northern, a train operator, has collaborated with students from the Bradford City Community Foundation to raise awareness about the issue. The film being screened at Birmingham New Street station was originally showcased at London Waterloo station. Jacqueline Starr, Chief Executive of the Rail Delivery Group, emphasizes the commitment of the industry to address all forms of sexual harassment and ensure the safety of passengers. She encourages individuals to report any uncomfortable situations. Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley and Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, expressed her support for the campaign, stating that everyone has the right to feel safe on railways and intervene to protect others. Jo MacPhail, HR Director and Deputy Managing Director at West Midlands Trains, stressed the importance of supporting this campaign, as sexual harassment is a real problem in our society, including on public transport. MacPhail believes that equipping individuals with knowledge on what to do in such situations can reduce harm and challenge these damaging behaviors. David Whitehouse, Safety and Security Director at Avanti West Coast, highlighted the commitment of the railway industry in ensuring the safety of passengers. He urges the public to be aware of different forms of sexual harassment and the role they can play in safely intervening and reporting incidents. This virtual reality experience serves as a valuable tool in raising awareness and equipping individuals with the necessary skills to create a safer environment on trains. By working together, passengers and railway authorities can help prevent and address incidents of sexual harassment.

Currently, gasoline is up to 4.25 a gallon. Tucson and most of Arizona is very car dependent due to geography. Our bus system runs every 30 minutes -- weekdays and hourly on weekends. The system has a phone app. What if you do not have a phone, if your phone is out of charge, if you cannot find the app? The bus stops have posted route numbers. There are no bus schedule or maps with routes. Inside of the bus, there is no posted information. As a result of this, bus drivers are continually beleaguered by a thousand questions. LyftUber: During the day, the cost, per mile, may be 1.78 per mile. Later, the cost can be 3 per mile. Evening rides -- 30 each way! With better public transportation, then we would not be stuck in the giant maw which is the automotivepetrol complex. Courtney Webb Northeast side Kudos to Gov. Hobbs Kudos to Gov. Hobbs for halting Fondomonte Corp's lease of AZ Trust Land for uncorrected land use violations. They are also growing (and exporting) feedstock for a giant Saudi dairy, paying just 21.60acre, including free groundwater. I agree with AG Mayes' statement that exporting said feedstock out of country is outrageous... given the current state of our water crisis. The 1980 Groundwater Management Act initiated the AZ Dept. of Water Resources, resulting in designated Active Management Areas (AMAs) to address groundwater overdraft. Rural counties rapidly losing groundwater would benefit from AMA designation as well. What is the right rate to pump, when groundwater is not being adequately replenished? Water should not be underpriced, but what price water -- our most precious resource? Gov. Hobbs has appointed a Water Policy Council, with recommendations due December 2023 to guide our state's water policy. We the people must write our Legislators and ACC, urging them to listen to these experts, prioritize equitable groundwater policy, and insure AZ's water future for generations to come. Barbara Reuter Southeast side Exposure to the abomination That sorry network is doing it again ... now promoting a national war in its desperate need to gain our attention! As disgusting as has been their incessant lying, they have now invoked this new low as they pander to a certain segment of our population. Such noise goes right along with the Trumpeter's clumsy use of lies, insults, threats, and encouraging violence, predictably parroted by equally disgusting elements of the Republican cult, as they try to overcome the indictments he has earned from our democratic institutions. We of course must continue to subject the unlawful and autocratic behavior of this person and his entourage to those institutions, allowing them to pursue their roles in guaranteeing honesty, fairness, equal treatment under the law ... and un-intimidated execution of justice! As we are exposed to what this abomination is willing to ferment, we are able to appreciate even more what our democratic values have brought us, knowing these and our common decency will bring us past these blights upon our existence! Frank Parsons Northeast side Domestic violence  gun violence Dear Editor, October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month -- a time to remember victims of domestic violence and advocate for its survivors. Unfortunately, last year the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against survivors and advocates in United States v. Rahimi: it is unconstitutional to prohibit people subject to Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs) from accessing firearms. Individuals under DVROs should not legally have access to firearms. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times as likely that a woman will be killed. Prohibiting dangerous people from accessing deadly weapons -- including domestic abusers -- is consistent with the Second Amendment. On November 7th, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to honor the work celebrated in October and protect survivors of domestic abuse. If Rahimi is not reversed, the Supreme Court will put the lives of families living in domestic violence in jeopardy. Sincerely, Students Demand Action at the University of Arizona Grassroots, youth-led gun violence prevention group Instagram: studentsdemand.uaz Mary Cline: President and Founder; Louise Taylor, Vice President; Adriana Grijalva, Chief Data Officer Adriana Grijalva, Chief Data Officer Midtown Not all possess humanity Re: the October 11 letter Humanity. The letter writer equates humanity as a quality all humankind possesses; it is not. In order to survive, humans will fight for their land and ultimately their survival. The letter writer fondly looks back to the 1960s, when flower power and endless love made the world better. It was not that way; I know, I was there. He dares to say, ... sure, we had Vietnam, when comparing what he thinks are frivolous wars today. Namely the wars in the Ukraine and the most recent conflict between Hamas and Israel. The letter writer seems to have overlooked the fact that our involvement in a war between two foreign powers (Vietnam) was ordered by the powers that be in the 1960s. Over 200,000 US soldiers died fighting for another country. Compare those fighting in the Ukraine and for both sides in the current conflict in the Middle East; these soldiers are fighting for their land and survival. And there was a six-day war in 1967; the third ArabIsraeli war. The letter writer forgot that as well. Karen Papagapitos Northwest side Employers, employees need fair rules Businesses are seeing more and more of these so-called neutrality agreements, which raises important questions about the rights and freedoms of employers and workers. Neutrality agreements sound innocuous enough. But a closer look reveals they are neither neutral nor are they agreements. Employees have a right to organize. That is not the issue here. What is the issue is the requirement of employers to remain silent during a union-organizing campaign, as these agreements do. Workers are left with only one side's opinion and that side is under no obligation to disclose facts the employee may want or need. And it is a stretch to call these arrangements agreements. In some cases, the federal government literally requires businesses to abide by these contracts in order to conduct federal business. Unions are not inherently bad, but neutrality agreements are. Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly should work to end this practice. Michelle Rill Midtown Act to prevent genocide I lived in Israel and felt the shudder of a Katusha rocket hitting the earth and that vibration moving through my body. That was in 1984. The violence Israelis and Palestinians are experiencing is so much more horrific than that. In order to prevent genocide of Palestinians, it is crucial to call for a cease-fire and condition aid to Israel on adhering to international law. Sincerely, Dev Mayaan Three Points Solar  ACC Re: the October 11 letter Go solar, save water. Kudos to the writer for bringing into sharp focus the water wasting consequences of the current Arizona Corporation Commission's all out assault on rooftop solar. Using tried and true identity politics' messaging by claiming the solar industry is a gigantic subsidy that must be vanquished, the Commission through Nick Myers is waging a multi pronged attack on the solar industry. First, reduce the amount that the utilities pay to rooftop solar ownersleasers and then revisit the 2017 heavily litigated, multi party solar energy export rate structure Agreement. At today's ACC hearing on the solar issue that could cost over 8,000 family wage jobs and decimate an entire industry Myers was called out for playing on his cell phone and purposely not paying any attention to the parade of passionate speakers opposing his scheme. Let them eat cake Nick? People will not forget how you favored out of state Utility shareholders over the water needs of Arizona citizens. Rick Rappaport Oro Valley America's sadism problem In the past ten years I have noticed a sharp upturn in people gaining delight in others' suffering. There are purposeful attack on others' politics, religion or ethnicity. Sadism is a punishment upon those whom are felt to be inferior, unworthy or just different. Our current sadism epidemic can mostly be traced to the rise of fascism, which promotes sadism, belligerence and hate. Sadism is a part of fascism because in most cases, fascism is led by a sociopath. Sociopaths love to inflict pain on others. Once the sociopathic fascist becomes a role model, followers emulate his vile traits. Sadism now becomes normalized in the fascist culture as acceptable behavior. We saw an increase in sadism that manifested itself in Asian hate crimes in the past five years and also obvious antisemitism. We are not going to solve our national sadism problem unless we solve our fascism problem. Fascist role models should not be heroes nor emulated. Doing so, makes us just as sadistic as our abnormal hero. Steve Rasmussen Foothills Corporate water hogs Thank you Governor Hobbs for canceling Fondamonte Corporation's leases of Arizona state trust land. Saudi-owned Fondamonte grows alfalfa for export to Saudi Arabia. They found a free water paradise in Arizona. Private citizen's wells are running dry in rural areas of our state, and there is a severe, ongoing drought affecting the Colorado River basin. It is time to end the practice of allowing these corporations to pump an unlimited amount of groundwater for free. That is why Governor Hobbs needs to apply the same principles and common sense to prevent Canadian-owned Hudbay Corporation from developing the Copper World open-pit mines in the Santa Rita mountains, south of Tucson. A loophole in Arizona's groundwater law allows mining companies to pump unlimited groundwater for free! We do not need another foreign-owned corporation depleting our aquifers for another product that will be exported for refining and sale, while the federal government is paying farmers here to leave their fields fallow. Arizona's most precious resource is not copper; it is water. Rick Johnson Sahuarita Saudi leasing land for their horse feed I am very happy that Gov. Hobbs has stripped the Saudi company from leasing state land for farming state land for alfalfa and wasting our precious water, that the Saudi government will not allow in their own country. I understand this leaves an issue relating to the state land use. May I suggest a way to replace the revenue and maybe improve it. Use the state land for a solar farm, goats managing the weeds under the solar cells (Agrivoltaics), and additionally making use of some of the land under the solar cells for an AquaponicsHydroponics operation. This type of system uses 90 less water than traditional farming, Adaptive redevelopment of infrastructure, and Nutrient management. Overall a yield of more than 3,000acreyr and around 70 Megawattsday electrical generation. An AquaHydroponic farm can also generate revenue, but using various internet sources this could also be in the area of 5,000 per acreyear. Richard Barnes Northwest side Walls work DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who should have been impeached already for dereliction of duty, announced that because of the dire conditions at the border in Texas, 20 miles of wall structure will be built. He will waive environmental regulations to do so. At the same time, he and President Biden said they opposed walls because they do not work. Guess that is why the DHS spent over 400,000 in building a wall around Biden's beach house in Delaware. Guess that is why in 2006, he voted for The Fence Act, that was supposed to build a dual layered fence along 700 miles of border. It was never completed. The Israelis built a wall along the Gaza strip, which curtailed the almost daily suicide bombers that were coming from there. Fences and walls work. Just think about the concrete wall around your backyard. Border walls work too. They stop, delay and impede illegal immigration and narcotics smuggling. I think Democrats oppose a border wall because they want unobstructed illegal immigration. Langhorne Bilby Marana View Comments Tags Localop Subscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Sayed Kazim Rafiqi, 42, a Herat city resident, said he had never seen such devastation before, with the majority of houses damaged and people terrified. Rafiqi and others headed to the hospital to donate much-needed blood. We have to help in any way possible, he said. The earthquakes on October 7 flattened whole villages in Herat, in one of the most destructive quakes in the country's recent history. More than 90 of the people killed a week ago were women and children, YOU.N. officials reported Thursday. Taliban officials said the earlier quakes killed more than 2,000 people across the province. The epicenter was in Zenda Jan district, where the majority of casualties and damage occurred. The initial quake, numerous aftershocks and the third 6.3-magnitude quake on Wednesday flattened villages, destroying hundreds of mud-brick homes that could not withstand such force. Schools, health clinics and other village facilities also collapsed. Besides rubble and funerals after that devastation, there was little left of the villages in the region's dusty hills. Survivors are struggling to come to terms with the loss of multiple family members and in many places, living residents are outnumbered by volunteers who came to search the debris and dig mass graves.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"NEW: Save the Children says four people have died, 153 injured.

ICE Brent settled 5.69 higher on the day, taking the front-month contract back above US90bbl - to its highest since early October. Uncertainty and concern over the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war continue to support the oil market. In recent days, Iran has warned about the risk of a wider conflict, while there are reports that Saudi Arabia has frozen talks to normalize relations with Israel. Providing a further boost to the oil market was the US Treasury imposing sanctions on two companies who apparently shipped Russian oil above the US60bbl G-7 price cap while using US-based shipping services. This is the first time we have seen the G-7 price cap enforced, which will raise fears that it will become more difficult to ship Russian oil and tighten the market up further. The US will be careful about enforcing the cap too strongly, particularly given the growing tension in the Middle East. Despite recent developments in the oil market, speculators remain reluctant to jump into the market. The latest positioning data shows that speculators reduced their net long in ICE Brent by 65,161 lots over the last reporting week to 153,174 lots as of last Tuesday. This move was largely driven by longs liquidating. The last week also saw a bit more activity from US oil drillers with the US oil rig count increasing by 4 last week to 501. While only a modest increase, it is still the largest weekly increase since March. Rig count changes in the weeks ahead will need watching because if this continues, it will suggest that US producers could be relaxing the capital discipline we have seen from them in recent years amid the higher price environment. China released its first batch of September trade data on Friday, which showed that crude oil imports averaged around 11.17MMbblsd over the month, down 11 MoM, but still up 14 YoY. This leaves cumulative imports over the first nine months of the year at 11.39MMbblsd, up 14.5 YoY. As for the calendar this week, the market will obviously continue to follow closely how the Israel-Hamas situation evolves. While for natural gas markets, workers in Australia are set to resume strike action at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities on Thursday if involved parties cannot resolve their differences in final negotiations. Metals - Gold breaks higher Spot gold saw significant strength on Friday. Prices settled more than 3.4 higher on the day, taking the market back above US1,900oz and to their highest since mid-September. A fall in US treasury yields will have provided some support to the gold market, while the ongoing uncertainty in the Middle East will likely have boosted demand for safe-haven assets. That said, when looking at weekly changes in gold ETF holdings, we do not see strong evidence of investor buying yet. In fact, ETF holdings in gold fell by 397koz last week to 86.7moz. The gold market has now had 20 consecutive weeks of ETF outflows. However, if uncertainty in the Middle East lingers and rates have peaked, we could start to see gold looking increasingly attractive to investors. Agriculture - Ukraine's corn and soybean harvest jumps The latest data from Ukraine's Agriculture Ministry shows that the domestic grain harvest is up 31 YoY to 35.6mt as of Friday. The increase was driven largely by corn, with the harvest increasing to 5.8mt from 1mt over the same period last year. Similarly, the soybean harvest rose to 3.8mt, up from 1mt last year. Trade data from China Customs released on Friday show that China's soybean imports fell 23.6 MoM and 7.3 YoY to 7.15mt in September, due to weak crush margins, slow presales of soymeal, and poor hog margins. However, cumulative imports are still up 14.4 YoY to 77.8mt over the first nine months of the year. The latest CFTC data show that money managers reduced their net bearish bets in CBOT corn by 46,742 lots to 112,691 lots as of 10 October. The fall was led by short-covering with the gross short decreasing by 36,609 lots to 286,547 lots. For soybeans, speculators decreased their net bullish bets by 2,835 lots to just 2,166 lots - the lowest since the week ending 30 May. Meanwhile, CBOT wheat saw speculators add to their net short by selling a further 5,547 lots, leaving them with a net short position of 104,335 lots.

Russia's Blac The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has been reporting that the major Russian offensive in the vicinity of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk Oblast, is flagging. Ukrainian military officials say they have continued to repel Russian attacks against their positions. Russian milbloggers (and again, these tend to be hard-war ultras, so to a certain extent their complaints count as statements against interest) attribute some of the Russian difficulties to inability to clear Ukrainian minefields, presumably under fire. One milblogger repeats complaints that worn out gun tubes are reducing the accuracy of Russian artillery fire. This is possible, and gun tubes (cannon barrels) do wear out with firing and need replacement. This, if true, is a logistical and management issue. This same source comments that over-optimistic assessments of unimportant local advances against unfortified sections of the zone may lead Russian forces to 'beat on concrete' fortifications until these forces run out. US and Ukrainian officials said that they would anticipated the Russian attacks, and were confident that Ukrainian forces would hold. John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, said, as paraphrased by the ISW, that Russian forces appear to be using human wave tactics, wherein the Russian military uses masses of poorly trained and equipped Russian soldiers to attempt to advance - the same practice Russian forces used during their failed winter offensive in winter 2023. Sunday's update from the ISW saw signs that President Putin is seeking to cool the more enthusiastic expectations of success around Avdiivka. He is described the operations around Avdiivka as an active defense, not an offensive, or even active combat operations. Sunday morning the UK's Ministry of Defense (MoD) described the importance of railroads to Russian logistics. Rail logistics continues to be a vital component in sustaining Russia's invasion. Russia uses its rail networks to move ammunition, armour, fuel and personnel into Ukraine. The rail network in occupied Ukraine remains largely viable but vulnerable to sporadic interdiction by Ukrainian artillery, air launched missiles and sabotage. In previous conflicts, attrition of rail transportation has required focused, sustained, and repeated attack by air andor ground forces. Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication in Ukraine and is constructing a new railway line to Mariupol which will reduce travel times for supplies to the Zaporizhzhia front. Russia is using civilian contractors and equipment to complete this project, likely calculating this will complicate targeting and preserve military railway troop capabilities for urgent tasks elsewhere. The new line falls within the notional range of Ukrainian long-range precision strike capabilities. Since suffering a series of strikes in August and September, the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) has highly likely doubled down on its defensive and reactive posture, the UK's MoD wrote Saturday. It has relocated many of its prestige assets - including cruise missile capable ships and submarines - from Sevastopol to operating and basing areas further east, such as Novorossiysk. Since July 2022, Ukraine has gained the initiative in the northwest Black Sea, forcing the powerful BSF to defend itself from uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs) and missile attacks as well as special operations. With notable and embarrassing exceptions, however, the BSF has mostly continued to train, maintain and defend itself whilst launching cruise missiles into Ukraine. It can almost certainly continue to do so from the eastern Black Sea. The Black Sea Fleet is now risk-averse. Despite the BSF's largely intact capabilities, there is only a realistic possibility of it using its conventional superiority in firepower to seize the initiative in the Western Black Sea. The risk of further military losses and the dire political consequences of Russian naval forces overtly attacking merchant shipping would highly likely outweigh any gain from attempting to enforce a blockade of Ukrainian-bound trade. The ISW reported that Ukrainian forces hit two Russian naval vessels, the Professor Nikolai Muru tugboat and the Pavel Derzhavin patrol ship, on October 13. As the Black Sea Fleet redeploys to Kerch, Novorossiysk, and Feodosia, lack of pier space and drydock facilities seem to have led them to retain a presence in Sevastopol. Redut seems to have replaced the Wagner Group as the leading private military company. The purported Private Military Company (PMC) Redut is recruiting mercenaries under the guise of volunteers, including former Wagner personnel, the UK's MoD reported this morning. The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) likely supervises and finances the group's activities, including its recruitment. Since the start of the invasion, Redut has been involved in combat operations in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Luhansk oblasts. The group highly likely has over 7,000 personnel. At present, Redut is one of a number of PMCs and Volunteer Corps units being utilised by the Russian Ministry of Defence to augment Russian regular forces. It is a realistic possibility that the Russian Ministry of Defence's practise of recruiting through 'volunteer' units has contributed to Russia avoiding further unpopular mobilisations. Trend Micro describes the recent activities of Void Rabisu, which it describes as an intrusion set associated with both financially motivated ransomware attacks and targeted campaigns on Ukraine and countries supporting Ukraine. In this case the intrusion was directed against the Women Political Leaders (WPL) Summit that convened in Brussels between June 7th and 8th of this year. The Summit's goal was to increase the participation of women in politics, and while that may not have been something the threat actors necessarily approved of, it seems likelier that the conference was simply a target of opportunity, a occasion to prospect and compromise devices and systems belonging to political leaders. The ultimate payload Void Rabisu delivered was a new version of ROMCOM backdoor that we have dubbed as ROMCOM 4.0 (also known as PEAPOD). Void Rabisu is an interesting mixed case of a organization (or, if you will an intrusion set) that has been financially motivated, that trades in the criminal-to-criminal market, but which engages in espionage and, once it is on its target, acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT). Void Rabisu also acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor when it targets governments and military. In June 2023, Void Rabisu exploited the vulnerability CVE-2023-36884 -- still a zero-day vulnerability then -- in campaigns using the Ukrainian World Congress and the July 2023 NATO summit as lures. The extraordinary geopolitical circumstances surrounding the war in Ukraine drives some of the financial-seeking threat actors (including Void Rabisu) toward campaigns motivated by espionage. Some of its earlier, more clearly financially motivated actions have been thought to be associated with a Cuba ransomware affiliate, BleepingComputer notes, but the activity now seems focused on zero-day exploitation for the purposes of espionage. There is no attribution of the activity so far. While we have no evidence that Void Rabisu is nation-state-sponsored, Trend Micro writes, it is possible that it is one of the financially motivated threat actors from the criminal underground that got pulled into cyberespionage activities due to the extraordinary geopolitical circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine. And in general Void Rabisu has consistently acted against Ukrainian interests.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has been reporting that the major Russian offensive in the vicinity of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk Oblast, is flagging.

Oye! Times,"The Indiscriminate Use of White Phosphorus - A War Crime? Remember this from back in May 2023? My, what a stir that caused in the world's media. Back then, the use of white phosphorus in civilian areas was considered a war crime by the BBC. Bad, bad Russia. Well, it looks like it is happening again but this time, it is new players getting in on the white phosphorus act. Apparently, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has determined that verified video and witness accounts show that Israel has used white phosphorus in military operations on both October 10th and 11th in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip respectively. Here is a collection of videos showing the recent use of white phosphorus against Israel's neighbours: As background, when white phosphorus is deployed in military operations, it is contained in artillery shells, bombs and rockets. It ignites when it is exposed to oxgen, burning at more than 800 degrees Celsius (1500 degrees Fahrenheit), creating a thick white smoke. It can ignite anything that it comes into contact with including fuel, ammunition, structures and, most concerningly, human flesh. Even small fragments have the capability of burning human flesh right the bone. Tiny fragments can also lodge in the flesh and spontaneously burst into flames at a later time. It can also be absorbed through inhalation, severely damaging the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart. While not for the faint of heart, here are some photos of rather horrifying white phosphorus burns from an article in the Lancet: Here is a FAQ sheet from the YOU.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry about white phosphorus: White phosphorus has two uses in military operations: 2.) to create a smokescreen to hide military movements. Since military operations use white phosphorus as a smokescreen, its use is not always forbidden by international law because military and political leaders can claim that it was not being used as an incendiary weapon. White phosphorus can be either groundburst or airburst; when it is deployed in an airburst fashion, it covers a larger area, however, its incendiary effects spread over densely populated areas far beyond where the munitions were deployed. According to the United Nations Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, the United Nations aimed at banning or restricting the use of certain types of weapons that could be considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to either combatants or which indiscriminately affect civilian populations. Protocol III aka the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the use of Incendiary Weapons of the Convention restricts the use of incendiary weapons which are designed to set fire to objects or because burn or respiratory injury to people: Included in these prohibited weapons are both napalm, heavily used by the United States during the Vietnam War, and white phosphorus. In total, 50 nations have signed the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and there are 127 parties that have approved, accepted, acceded to, succeeded to or ratified the Convention. Israel approved the Convention on Marcy 22, 1995 but has not signed it and has added the following declarations: Israel as also stated that it does not consent to be bound by Protocol 3, the aforementioned ban on the use of incendiary weapons. In contrast, both the Russian Federation and the United States have both signed and ratified the Convention as a whole. Israel's historical use of white phosphorus suggests that it is part of Israel's plan to subjugate its Palestinian neighbours as shown in this 2009 analysis, also from Human Rights Watch: Here is a quote from the 2009 HRW report with my bolds: This report documents Israel's extensive use of white phosphorus munitions during its 22-day military operations in Gaza, from December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009, named Operation Cast Lead. Based on in-depth investigations in Gaza, the report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repeatedly exploded white phosphorus munitions in the air over populated areas, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital. White phosphorus munitions did not kill the most civilians in Gaza - many more died from missiles, bombs, heavy artillery, tank shells, and small arms fire - but their use in densely populated neighborhoods, including downtown Gaza City, violated international humanitarian law (the laws of war), which requires taking all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm and prohibits indiscriminate attacks. The unlawful use of white phosphorus was neither incidental nor accidental. It was repeated over time and in different locations, with the IDF air-bursting the munition in populated areas up to the last days of its military operation. Even if intended as an obscurant rather than as a weapon, the IDF's repeated firing of air-burst white phosphorus shells from 155mm artillery into densely populated areas was indiscriminate and indicates the commission of war crimes. In any case, Israel's use of white phosphorus for any purpose in the extremely densely populated Gaza Strip can only be described as a cruel punishment against those whose only crime is to live in Gaza. History does appear to show that white phosphorus is one of Israel's weapons of choice even though its use as an incendiary weapon is prohibited by Protocol III of the YOU.N. Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, a key part of the convention that Israel cleverly chose to not sign. Apparently, using white phosphorus during a military conflict is only a war crime when it is Russia using it.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) has determined that verified video and witness accounts show that Israel has used white phosphorus in military operations on both October 10th and 11th in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip respectively.

He had been due to visit CS wind, the world's largest facility for wind tower construction, which just so happens to be in the congressional district of far-right Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert.

'The president's trip to Colorado is postponed and it will be rescheduled,' said a White House official. 'The president will remain at the White House to participate in national security meetings.' A day earlier he condemned an apparent hate crime in Illinois after a six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death. The boy was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch serrated blade, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. His 32-year-old mother also suffered multiple stab wounds but is expected to survive after the attack in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles from Chicago. The suspect, Joseph Czuba, 71, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the sheriff's office said. 'He knocked on the door and that he attempted to choke her, and said, you Muslims must die, and attempted to stab her, and stabbed her,' said Ahmed Rehab, president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Chicago. 'And, she went to the bathroom and called 911. And, this was all in her own words.' Biden said the boy's family were Palestinian Muslims who 'came to America seeking what we all seek - a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.' 'This horrific act of hate has no place in America, he said. Israel was evacuating civilians Monday living in villages close to the border with Lebanon and threatened to 'destroy' the country if the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah enters the conflict. The military issued the evacuation order to residents living within 1.2 miles of the Israeli-Lebanese border as Israel fears reprisals from Hezbollah for its imminent invasion of the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah terrorists have vowed to 'respond' to any move to invade Gaza with the group's chief saying they are 'fully prepared' to join Hamas in its war against Israel, raising already heightened fears of an all-out conflict in the Middle East. Residents of the 28 villages and settlements close to the Lebanese border will now be evacuated and put up in guesthouses in towns in the centre of Israel that are considered safer - but Hezbollah's huge arsenal of rockets can strike any target in Israel including the main city Tel Aviv. The evacuation order comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the nation was 'approaching a fateful hour' with more than 400,000 Israeli soldiers now gearing up for a battle in Gaza that will see street-fighting erupt in the tiny 25-mile long enclave. More than one million people have now fled their homes in northern Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair in a desperate attempt to escape Israel's imminent invasion and continued aerial bombardment of the Hamas-ruled territory. But the United Nations has warned that a 'spectre of death' looms over Gaza where millions are stranded amid Israel's total siege that is blocking food, water, medicine and fuel from reaching the enclave.

Hamas did not do that for the families slaughtered in their beds': Israeli diplomat defends military's response to terror atrocity, with 2,750 now killed in Palestine Advertisement Israel declared war on Hamas terrorists on Sunday - a day after waves of its gunmen broke through the border and massacred 1,300 Israelis including women and children. Some 199 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - higher than previous estimates of 150, the Israeli military said today. In the days since, Israel has launched a relentless barrage of airstrikes that have obliterated entire neighbourhoods in Gaza and killed 2,750 Palestinians and wounded 9,600 more civilians. The UN said today that 47 entire families, amounting to around 500 people, have been wiped out in Israel's bombing campaign. But undeterred by the comments of human rights observers over recent days, Netanyahu said preparations were being made around the clock to launch the ground offensive, with nearly 400,000 soldiers gearing up for battle in Gaza. He said menacingly: 'They are ready to take action to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us. Hamas thought that we would come apart - we will demolish Hamas.' The Israeli military's rules of engagement have reportedly been 'loosened' for the land, air and sea attack to allow fewer checks before shooting. Israeli forces, supported by a growing deployment of YOU.S. warships in the region and the call-up of some 360,000 reservists, positioned themselves along Gaza's border and drilled for what Israel said would be a broad campaign to dismantle the terror group. But much of Hamas' military infrastructure is concealed in urban areas, where street-by-street fighting would likely because mounting casualties on both sides if Israel invades with a ground offensive. Meanwhile, Hamas-backer Iran and Lebanon's terror group Hezbollah, which is also supported by Tehran, have warned that an invasion of Gaza would be met with a 'response'. Last week, Hezbollah chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said the group was 'ready' and would 'contribute' to confrontations against its southern neighbour. And yesterday rockets, artillery fire and anti-tank shells were exchanged between Lebanon and Israel, threatening to drag the region into open warfare. Hezbollah militants also started destroying surveillance cameras on several Israeli army posts along the border with Lebanon. The terror group released a video Monday showing snipers destroying surveillance cameras placed on five points along the Lebanon-Israel border, including one outside the Israeli town of Metula. Hezbollah's aim appears to be to prevent the Israeli army from monitoring movements on the Lebanese side of the border. Meanwhile, as Israeli jets have carried out bombing runs in Lebanon, the IDF threatened to 'destroy' the country if Hezbollah entered the war. Tzachi Hanegbi, an Israeli national security advisor, has warned the Iran-sponsored terror group to stand down from creating a second combat front - or reckon with 'the destruction of Lebanon'. And IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari today said Hezbollah will face a 'deadly' response if it continues to carry out attacks against Israel. 'Hezbollah carried out a number of attacks yesterday in order to try to divert our operational efforts away from the Gaza Strip, under the direction and backing of Iran, while endangering the state of Lebanon and its citizens,' Hagari said. 'We have increased our forces on the northern border and respond aggressively to any activity against us,' he said. 'If Hezbollah dares to test us, the reaction will be deadly. The United States is giving us full backing,' Hagari said. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister threatened 'no one can guarantee non-expansion of war' if Israel invaded Gaza. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden, who has repeatedly proclaimed support for Israel, said that while invading and 'taking out the extremists' was needed, any move by Israel to occupy Gaza would be a 'big mistake'. The warning comes just days after Biden said Israel's retaliatory action must be 'according to the rule of law'. Thousands of families have fled their homes in the north of Gaza, carrying whatever belongings they can, following an Israeli order to move south. 'No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I am losing my humanity,' said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south of the enclave, and is having to stay with strangers.

'There is currently no truce and humanitarian aid in Gaza in exchange for getting foreigners out,' a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. Hospitals in Gaza are expected to run out of generator fuel in the next 24 hours, endangering the lives of thousands of patients, according to the UN. Gaza's sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the enclave following the Hamas attack. The World Health Organization said hospitals are 'overflowing' as people seek safety. 'We are concerned about disease outbreaks due to mass displacement and poor water and sanitation,' it said. Four hospitals in northern Gaza are no longer functioning and 21 have received Israeli orders to evacuate. Doctors have refused, saying it would mean death for critically ill patients and newborns on ventilators. Israel's decision to cut off water supplies, combined with a lack of fuel for pumps and desalination stations, has caused shortages, putting 3,500 patients in 35 hospitals across Gaza at risk. 'Water is needed to ensure sanitary conditions on inpatient wards, in operation rooms, and emergency departments. It is essential for the prevention of hospital associated infections and for the prevention of outbreaks in hospitals,' the WHO said. The YOU.N. health agency said life-saving assistance for 300,000 patients is currently awaiting entry through Rafah. In Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of 3. Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital, where fuel is expected to run out by Monday, said Dr. Mohammed Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex. There were 35 patients in the ICU who require ventilators and another 60 on dialysis. If fuel runs out, 'it means the whole health system will be shut down,' he said, as children moaned in pain in the background. these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.' Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of pediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility did not evacuate despite Israeli orders. There were seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators, he said. Evacuating 'would mean death for them and other patients under our care.' Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the regional director of the World Health Organization, said hospitals were able to move some mobile patients out of the north, but most patients cannot be evacuated, he said. Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory's largest, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its morgue overflowed. Tens of thousands of people seeking safety have gathered in the hospital compound. Gaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege. 'An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes,' said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the YOU.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

The military says it is trying to clear away civilians ahead of a major campaign against Hamas in the north, where it says the terrorists have extensive networks of tunnels, bunkers and rocket launchers. Hamas urged people to stay in their homes, and the Israeli military released photos it said showed a Hamas roadblock preventing traffic from moving south. Nevertheless, a million civilians have fled their homes - fearing that if they did not, they would face certain death. Meanwhile, Israel's ambassador to the UK today defended her military's brutal bombardment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, arguing this morning that Tel Aviv's military at least gave Gazans warning that the attacks were coming. Tzipi Hotovely, 44, gave an impassioned and defiant speech, pointing out that Hamas terrorists launched their attacks with no forewarning and slaughtered innocent, unarmed Israeli citizens. 'Hamas are in charge of any harm that will be happening in Gaza to their own people. If we see innocent people get killed in Gaza, it is Hamas in charge,' she said. 'It is not Israel's responsibility - we do not have any obligation to bring Gaza water. 1,300 Israelis were targeted, slaughtered... they did not get 24 hours to flee or protect themselves.' Later, when pushed by a BBC Radio 4 interviewer on allegations that Israel is doling out collective punishment on the Palestinian people, Hotovely hit back, bringing up the Royal Air Force's carpet bombing of German cities amid a bitter campaign to defeat Nazi Germany in WWII. '600,000 Germans were killed in your attacks on Hamburg and Dresden. Why? Because you knew this was the only way you could defeat the Nazis,' she declared. 'We are giving the people in Gaza the opportunity (to flee) that (Israelis) were never given... they were slaughtered in their beds,' she concluded. As more than a million civilians in Gaza fled their homes, analysts suggested Israel could become bogged down for more than a year hunting for terrorists in the 25-mile long enclave. Nimrod Novik, a former senior Israeli diplomat and security adviser, said some military and political leaders wanted soldiers to undertake 18 months of door-to-door arrest operations to root out the Hamas top brass.

The Israeli military also reported shooting at one of its border posts. The fighting killed at least one person on the Israeli side and wounded several on both sides of the border. Meanwhile, the country has been urged by its allies - including Britain - to be 'restrained' in its response so as not to inflame a furious backlash in the Arab world. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducted a whistle-stop tour of Arab states at the weekend in order to preserve the fragile peace in the wider region. He reiterated that Washington stands with Israel 'today, tomorrow and every day' but it must take 'every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians'. But his various Arab hosts did not necessarily share the same view with Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi saying after Blinken's visit to Cairo that Israel had already 'exceeded the right to self-defence'. Blinken returned to Israel on Monday for talks on the conflict after completing the frantic six-country tour through Arab nations aimed at preventing the fighting from igniting a broader regional conflict. The top US diplomat, who was in Israel on Thursday on a solidarity visit, landed in Tel Aviv and was expected to again meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Washington has been trying to broker a deal to reopen Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza to allow Americans and other foreigners to leave and humanitarian aid amassed on the Egyptian side to be brought in. The crossing, which was closed because of airstrikes early in the war, has yet to reopen.

Naturally CNN senior political correspondent Adam Kinzinger was quick to criticize. Imagine being such a tool of the left in order to keep a job with CNN. Kinzinger is blasting a governor for bringing residents of his state home in an emergency situation.

Well, Adam, the first plane carrying 300 Floridians home landed at Tampa International Airport on Sunday night and the governor and his wife, Casey, were there to greet them. Sorry to disappoint Kinzinger but when DeSantis says he is doing something, he gets it done. That is his brand. He keeps his word and gets stuff done.

Once the plane landed in Tampa, evacuees were able to access resources from multiple state agencies. Additionally, the governor is sending medical supplies, hygiene products, clothing and children's toys to Israel to help impacted Israelis, the news release said. Bryan Stern, CEO and founder of Project DYNAMO, the search and rescue non-profit organization that facilitated the flight, told reporters that 270 people were on board the plane. The rescuees included 91 children and four dogs, Stern said. Many people on the plane cried when it touched down in Tampa, he added. DeSantis knew he could do what he was doing when he signed the executive order. The EO enabled Florida Division of Emergency Management to bring Floridians home and to transport supplies to Israel. Competence is refreshing, is not it? I am proud of how quickly we have been able to activate resources and do what the federal government could not -- get Floridians and other Americans back home, reunited with their families, free of charge, DeSantis said in Sunday's news release.

Residents of the densely populated coastal strip had been given more time to move, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said. Israeli army spokesman Arye Sharuz Shalicar rejected claims that adverse weather was the reason for the delay in comments to German public broadcaster ARD on Sunday evening. According to an unconfirmed media report, the ground offensive had been planned for this weekend, but was postponed due to cloudy skies and poor visibility for pilots and drones. There were reports that Hamas was preventing civilians from fleeing. Israel has repeatedly accused the Islamist organisation of using its own population as human shields. Israels repeated instructions to Gazans to leave the area have been widely criticised, including by the UN which has warned of the danger of a humanitarian catastrophe.Biden weighs Israel visit, warns against Gaza occupation More than 600,000 residents of the Gaza Strip have heeded the calls to move from the Gaza City region in the north to the south of the strip, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari has said. Hagari repeated that Israeli forces were targeting Hamas, and were seeking to avoid harming civilians. The coastal enclave of Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2.2 million people living on around 45 sq km. The Israeli military has been bombarding targets in Gaza since the unprecedented attacks on Israeli civilians carried out by Hamas fighters on October 7. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organisation by the European Union, the United States and Israel. The IDF said on Sunday it had attacked more than 100 Hamas military targets in Zeitoun, Khan Younis and western Jabalia, hitting operational command centres, military facilities, dozens of launching pads for anti-tank missiles and observation posts. Israels goal is to wipe out the political and military leadership of the Islamist organisation Hamas, which launched thousands of rockets toward Israel while hundreds of its fighters breached border defences in an unprecedented surprise attack over a week ago in a massacre that left more than 1,300 dead, including 286 servicemen and women. One week after the start of the latest conflict, the number of dead in the Gaza Strip has risen to 2,670, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Sunday. Around 9,200 others were injured in the territory, which is under the control of Hamas, it said.Arab paramedic who treated Israelis injured by Hamas remembered as a hero More than 1,000 people have been buried under rubble in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli armys bombardment in response to Hamas large-scale attacks last weekend, according to Palestinian sources. There were injured and dead among them, the civil defence authorities in the Gaza Strip announced on Sunday. Many of those affected were rescued alive from under the rubble of destroyed buildings 24 hours after bombings, it added. This means that the number of reported dead on the Palestinian side in just over a week is already higher than during the Gaza war in 2014, when 2,250 people died in the coastal strip within 50 days. At that time, 66 Israeli soldiers and five civilians were also killed. The new conflict is the confrontation with the most deaths since Hamas violently took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met for the first time with representatives of the relatives of the hostages taken over a week ago by Hamas, Israeli media reported on Sunday. The Palestinian militant organisation abducted more than 150 people in the attack. The relatives of the hostages have been criticising Israels government. They accuse the leadership of abandoning the prisoners.Israel gone beyond self-defence in Gaza: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Since Hamas attacks on Israel and the Israeli armys counter-attacks on Gaza, there have been regular incidents along the border between Israel and Lebanon in recent days, fuelling concerns of further escalation. The Hezbollah militia, which is trained and financed by Iran, is considered much more powerful than Hamas. Several towns in northern Israel were again put on alert on Sunday after rockets were fired from Lebanon, the IDF said. The Israeli army said it attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanon again on Sunday evening. The military did not provide further details, including whether there were other attacks from Lebanon. Hezbollah and the military wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam Brigades, both claimed to have fired rockets in retaliation for Israels bombing of Gaza. Sources close to Hezbollah said that the renewed rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel was a warning  It does not mean that Hezbollah has entered the conflict. Israel also has no interest in widening the current conflict, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday. If Hezbollah opts for war, they will pay a very high price, he warned. But if they restrain themselves, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is.Hamas, Iran leaders to boost cooperation after historic victory against Israel The US administration has made clear that the civilian population needs to be protected in any Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip, US President Joe Bidens National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. Sullivan stressed that the US hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza are the highest possible priority for Biden. While there were 15 US citizens unaccounted for, he was unable to confirm the precise number of hostages being held. Netanyahu and Biden have agreed to reopen water supplies in southern Gaza. The decision will contribute to the movement of civilians from the north of the coastal strip to the south, Israels Energy Minister Israel Katz wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday. Israels army could thus intensify the destruction of Hamas infrastructure in the north of the Gaza Strip, he wrote. Eyewitnesses reported in the evening that the water supply in the coastal strip had been restored. Many residents came to public water stations to fill canisters and bottles.

CTA leaders worry that riders feel a sense of complacency around climbing onto the tracks, chief safety and security officer Nancy-Ellen Zusman said. Zusman and the CTA hope to bring rail trespassing, and the harms that can result, onto a downward trajectory with a new rail safety campaign launched Monday. It is more common for people to climb down onto the tracks to retrieve objects than because they are intoxicated or suicidal, Zusman said. In fact, suicide is the least common reason, followed by intoxication. But it is most common for riders to climb down for no known reason at all. Fifty-three percent of people who have climbed onto CTA tracks this year as of August had no known reason for doing so, according to CTA personnel. CTA trains are powered by an electrified third rail, which carries 600 volts of electricity -- a potentially lethal amount. Unfortunately, we do see cases in which people are just goofing around, CTA spokesperson Brian Steele said. ... They are not retrieving an item, they have not fallen, they just make the decision to go down there. The CTA's first rail safety campaign launched 10 years ago last month. Trespassing incidents on CTA tracks dropped 17 the following year, Steele said. Was the campaign solely responsible for that? Hard to say, Steele said. However, there is no question that the campaign really raised awareness and began a lot of dialogue. Though the CTA has not tracked trespassing consistently since the first rail safety campaign in 2013, Steele said, reduced rail service during 2020 led to a recent annual low of 1,584 trespassing. In 2021, about 1,900 people stepped onto the CTA tracks and 1,860 in 2022. Steele says the CTA expects another slight drop in trespassing incidents by the end of this year. Service interruptions due to trespassing on the electrified CTA tracks, also known as rail right of way, are most common on the Red and Blue lines, Steele said. So far this year, 350 trespassers climbed down onto Red Line tracks, with 323 trespassers on Blue Line tracks. The Yellow Line, traveling between Rogers Park and Skokie, sees the fewest rail right-of-way delays, with 30 trespassers so far this year. Service interruptions due to rail trespassing have caused 93 hours of delays through August of this year, Steele said. The CTA does not track what proportion of delays overall are caused by trespassing, though rail right-of-way delays are most common during weekday rush hours, Steele said. It is basically just a function of the ridership -- when more people are there, there are more instances, Steele said. When someone climbs onto the rail right of way, CTA personnel cut power to large sections of track so that tracks are not active or electric during rescue attempts, Zusman said. There is a whole ripple effect, Zusman said. While the CTA does not track the demographics of people who come down onto the tracks, Steele said the organization hopes to reach more young people with the new campaign. Some ads parody music streaming service Spotify with fake song titles like Severe Burns, Sudden Impact and Everybody Hurts. CTA platforms rise 4 feet above track level, a distance some riders find deceivingly short, Steele said. The amount of electricity running through the tracks can be fatal, but conductivity -- factoring in conditions like clothes and the weather -- determines climbers' fate. Track shutdowns happen fast when people are spotted on the third rail, Steele said, and CTA workers are trained to climb safely onto the tracks to get riders' things if alerted. Sometimes people go down to the tracks thinking, 'I will just get my phone,' and then realize, 'I should not be here, it is difficult for me to get back up,' Steele said. Riders have been known to climb down onto CTA tracks and try to walk the rail from one station to another, Steele said. Graffiti artists are also frequent trespassers on CTA rails, accounting for 24 of recorded incidents through August 2023. Train yards at the end of the Red Line at Howard, and on the Green Line at Ashland and Midway, are graffiti hot spots, though graffiti-based climbers are most active on Orange Line tracks, Steele said. Metra struggles with similar graffiti issues, Zusman said -- though tracks at Metra train yards are not electrified. A lot of people will go into where we store our trains, typically in the nighttime, to try and graffiti a train, Steele said. When they are there, they are around live tracks. The campaign, which also features a looping audio message and a series of PSAs in the style of graphic novels, can be seen on every platform and in train cars, focusing on high-traffic stations such as Belmont, Steele said. When tracking why people trespass on CTA tracks, CTA staff rely on data collected at the scene, Zusman said. Staff are not required to follow up on police or medical examiner's reports when someone appears intoxicated, for instance. Basically we look for the signs of impairment -- any type of impairment -- and that is what is reported in our system, Zusman said. The CTA also tracks when trains collide with people or brush people while pulling into a station. Though not every contact between a train and a rider ends in injury, the CTA investigates every time it is reported by a rider or train operator or shown on security cameras, Zusman said. Though it is rare for a rail right-of-way incident to end in death, it is doubly tragic knowing that the circumstances could have been avoided, Steele said. The number of fatalities every year is extremely low compared to our ridership, Steele said. That said, one fatality is one too many.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Just under 1,200 people climbed onto CTA tracks in the first eight months of 2023.

It might be difficult for most of us to confront, but the world is facing an unprecedented explosion in online child sexual exploitation and abuse and it is getting worse with every passing day, Julie Inman Grant, eSafety Commissioner, wrote in her report. In February, I asked Twitter (subsequently known as X), TikTok, Google (including YouTube), Discord and Twitch what steps they are taking to tackle these crimes against children playing out on their services. Their answers revealed similar troubling shortfalls and inconsistencies. For example, we found that while YouTube, TikTok and Twitch are taking steps to detect child abuse in livestreams, Discord is not, saying that implementing the required tools is 'prohibitively expensive' for its service. TikTok and Twitch use language analysis technology to detect CSEA activity such as sexual extortion across all parts of their services whereas Discord does not use any detection tools at all. Twitter uses tools on public content, but not on direct messages. Google uses tools on YouTube, but not on Chat, Gmail, Meet and Messages. Google and Discord are not blocking links to known child sexual exploitation material, despite the availability of databases from expert organisations like the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation. Google only blocks links on its search service. YouTube, TikTok and Twitch are using technology to detect grooming, whereas TwitterX, Discord and other Google services including Meet, Chat, Gmail, Messages, are not. Google is also not using its own technology to detect known child sexual exploitation videos on some of its services - Gmail, Chat and Messages. There was significant variation in the languages covered by content moderators. Google said it covers at least 71 languages and TikTok 73. In comparison Twitter said it covered only 12 languages, Twitch reported 24 and Discord report 29. This means that some of the top 5 non-English languages spoken at home in Australia are not by default covered by Twitter, Discord or Twitch moderators. This is particularly important for harms like grooming, violent extremism or hate speech which can require context and understanding of cultural nuances to identify. We also found wide variations in the response times to user reports of child abuse - TikTok says it responds within 5 minutes for public content, Twitch takes 8 minutes, while Discord takes 13 hours for direct messages. TwitterX and Google did not provide the information required. Google failed to comply by giving generic or aggregated information across multiple services where information regarding specific services was required. Google has been given a Formal Warning to deter it from future non-compliance. eSafety found that TwitterX's non-compliance was more serious. For some questions, TwitterX failed to provide any response leaving some boxes entirely blank. In other instances, Twitter provided a response that was otherwise incomplete or inaccurate. It is for this reason that TwitterX has been issued with an infringement notice of 610,500. The company now has 28 days to either request a withdrawal stating valid reasons as to why, or pay up. If in the event TwitterX does not pay, eSafety has the option to seek a civil penalty through the courts.

Australia issued a fine of 610,500 Australian dollars (386,000) on Monday against X ,formerly known as Twitter, for falling short in disclosing information on how it tackles child sex abuse content. In February, I asked Twitter, TikTok, Google (including YouTube), Discord and Twitch what steps they are taking to tackle these crimes against children playing out on their services. Their answers revealed similar troubling shortfalls and inconsistencies."

Indeed, workers eventually agreed to drop the strike and restart negotiations.

In the latest update on the situation, Reuters reported that the talks had prompted angry comments from Chevron, which has said the workers were being unreasonable. The news agency, however, cited an unnamed source as suggesting the union was not going to make concessions and Chevron would have to change its position on several issues to avoid new strikes. The union's decision to ignore the recommendation ... while discussions are continuing is very concerning, unreasonable and undermines the considerable progress made prior to Chevron requesting the Commission's assistance last week, a Chevron spokesperson told Reuters.

Together, the two account for over 5 of global LNG production capacity, and any disruption or even the suggestion of disruption of supply immediately affects global LNG prices. Right now is an especially vulnerable time for gas prices, particularly in Europe, as the reignition of violence between Israel and Hamas has prompted the shutdown of one large gas field offshore Israel, sparking fear of supply disruptions.

He said the signage was poor and if he exited the same way, he would end up doing the same thing. So he went a different way and ended up in the car trap. We know of someone in their 20s who has also gone into the trap - you cannot argue this is because of my father's age. Considering the number of incidents, there must be another way to manage the junction that does not because this much damage to vehicles. Philippa Parker from Wiltshire, who drove into the trap last summer, also argues poor signposting leading up to the trap is what led to the incident. She said: The signs were totally inadequate. Motorists were driving up to the junction while we were waiting for the recovery. If we were not there, they would have made the same mistake. The abuse and awful language people were shouting as they passed us was also shocking. It left us with a very bad impression of St Ives afterwards.

Abdelnasser Rashid, during a news conference at the Muslim Community Center on Chicago's Northwest Side, Sunday,Jim Vondruska  AP An Illinois man stabbed a 6-year-old boy to death and critically wounded his mother in an alleged anti-Muslim hate crime, the Will County Sheriff's Office said Sunday, calling it a senseless and cowardly act of violence. Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The sheriff's office did not provide more corroboration, but said, despite the suspect not providing a statement to detectives, personnel were able to gather enough information through interviews and evidence to charge him with two hate crimes. This horrific act of hate has no place in America, President Joe Biden said in a statement.

We join everyone here at the White House in sending our condolences and prayers to the family, including for the mother's recovery, and to the broader Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities, Biden said. The boy was stabbed 26 times at his Plainfield home by his landlord, Joseph Czuba, 71, investigators said. He later died at the hospital. His mother, 32, was stabbed more than a dozen times, authorities said, adding she is at a hospital and is expected to survive. The female victim stated that she ran into the bathroom and continued to fight off her attacker as she dialed 911, the sheriff's office said.

But it was fleeting, as airstrikes rained down on Gaza, and he confronted the uncertainty of whether he, his wife, Najla, and their two daughters would be able to flee. The translator's wife and children still do not have YOU.S. passports, and he is received no official word to indicate that the border will actually be opening. And even if it does, he said, it is highly risky to travel amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza strip. There are no guarantees. There is not like a safe corridor offered to foreign nationals when they leave, it is every man for himself, Shawa, who is staying in a small two-room cabin in central Gaza, approximately 40 minutes from the border, with his family and 50 neighbors after they had to evacuate their homes. Mai Abushaban, a Palestinian American, is also fearful. She said that her mother and sister would attempt to cross into Egypt Monday. They became trapped in Gaza while visiting her sick grandfather. If it is true and it is open they are going to go, Abushaban, a 22-year-old Houston native said, referencing the lack of details from the embassy or state department that led to false hopes last week. We are hoping it is for real this time. But late Sunday night, Abushaban received an email from the YOU.S. Embassy in Jerusalem stating that they anticipate the situation at the Rafah crossing will remain fluid and unpredictable and it is unclear whether, or for how long, travelers will be permitted to transit the crossing. The message has left Abushaban feeling worried that it might not work out like when they tried to cross days ago -- but still hopeful. Up to 600 Americans remain in Gaza, according to the State Department, amid an increasing humanitarian crisis as clean water, food, fuel, and medical supplies dwindle. There has not been electricity in the territory for days, after the Israeli government established a blockade in retaliation for Hamas' brutal terror attack. More than 2,450 people have been killed in Gaza and 9,200 have been injured. In Israel, 1,400 people have been killed and 3,500 have been wounded. The death toll for Americans from Hamas' attack on Israel and the subsequent war stands at 30, a State Department spokesperson said today. A series of automated emails from the State Department and inconclusive phone calls have left Palestinian Americans dubious about the likelihood of them safely getting out. Since the war broke out between Israel and Hamas, the Rafah crossing has been closed and has also sustained physical damage from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. Asked Sunday on NBC News if there will be no shelling near the crossing as people try to leave and humanitarian assistance comes in, Israel Defense Force IDF Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said, it is very much up to Hamas to decide if they are going to allow and what is going to happen. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Rafah crossing will be opened for YOU.S. citizens and their immediate family members but provided no details on timing to reporters in Cairo on Sunday. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Embassy of Palestine representative told NBC News that the Rafah crossing said foreign national Palestinians will be able to cross the border starting 9 a.m. local time. Shawa, who was born in Seattle to a Palestinian father and American mother, said the YOU.S. government is not offering any other tangible assistance to citizens in Gaza other than orchestrating the opening of the Rafah crossing. Cairo is an arduous six to eight hour drive from the border crossing, through the Sinai peninsula and through several Egyptian military checkpoints. The double standard Abushaban, who has crossed the Rafah border 10 times during past trips to visit family in Gaza, said opening up the border does not necessarily guarantee passage through it. There are two parts to the land crossing -- first, a security check manned by the Palestinian authority and then a bus ride to the Egyptian-controlled part of the border. She said usually the Egyptian side is chaotic with long wait times. If anything goes wrong from point A to point B they will turn the buses around and turn everyone back without any notice, she said of her previous experiences crossing the border. The long drive to Cairo from Gaza is risky, with multiple military checkpoints along the Sinai. The first automated email Abushaban received from the State Department on Tuesday included information on how Americans in Israel would be evacuated, but the messaging for those in Gaza was not as helpful. Given the dynamic security situation in Gaza, YOU.S. citizens should assess their own security when deciding whether to travel. YOU.S. government personnel are not able to travel to Gaza or the Gaza periphery to assist at this time, the email, reviewed by NBC News, read. The State Department then followed up a couple days later acknowledging their most recent message, sent to a large list of YOU.S. citizens located in Gaza and Israel, may not be applicable to you because it detailed options for Americans in Israel who have access to Ben Gurion airport -- something those in Gaza do not have. The email added that the state department was working on solutions but the situation is incredibly complex. It is very frustrating for me as someone with one foot in Palestine and one foot in the United States, Abushaban said, referring to the State Department's communications. The State Department saying that Americans in Israel will be evacuating them via boat and plane to either Germany, Cyprus or Greece, and that Palestinians in Gaza should just kind of, you know, wait, she added. Emilee Rauschenberger, who was in Khan Yunis with her husband and five children visiting her in-laws when the war started, echoed Abushaban's sentiments of feeling neglected as an American citizen in Gaza by the YOU.S. government. I feel the government kind of feels absolved of it as a responsibility, because of the politics of it all, Rauschenberger said, adding that she does not feel there is been an attempt to save American lives in Gaza. The double standard is incredibly harsh, Rauschenberger said. Blinken has been on a days-long tour of the Middle East where he is met with leaders from Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar. The effort was meant to prevent the war against Israel and Hamas from spreading and to encourage Israel to not target civilians. Second-class citizens For Palestinian-Americans, the lack of guidance from the YOU.S. government cements a feeling they say they are familiar with. Palestinian Americans are almost like, I personally feel like we were treated as second class citizens in the country where we hold citizenship, and, you know, just as lawfully as anyone else, Abushaban said. Shawa said that over the years living in Gaza with his family, he has never felt prioritized by the YOU.S. government. I mean, Gaza. has to 2.2 or 3 million citizens the vast majority of us are not affiliated to Hamas or any other political, Palestinian faction, Shawa said referring to YOU.S. politicians speaking about Gaza as if it is a hamas block. We have children, we go to schools, we have birthdays, we have restaurants, we have, I mean, everything that makes up a normal community, Shawa said. His eldest daughter, Zayneb, turned 9 on Sunday. They found some kind of, you know, packaged doughnut-y thingy and stuck a candle in it and sang 'Happy Birthday,' Shawa said, referring to the impromptu gesture some of the children organized for her. For Shawa, attempting to cross the border with his family is not only dangerous, but emotionally taxing, and could mean they will never see their loved ones again. I mean, we are with people, friends, neighbors, relatives, who do not have this privilege, Shawa said. It is really, really, really hard to make the decision to leave them behind.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Palestinian American Jason Shawa, 55, heard the news that Rafah crossing, on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, will be opened Monday.

For many older and disadvantaged Australians, the proposed constitutional changes were perceived to be threatening changes. Racial and social divisions did not commence with preparations for the Voice referendum. As a royal navy navigator and later buccaneer, William Dampier (1651-1715) made three voyages to WA and offered this interpretation of our indigenous people after his second voyage in 1697 with his infamous throw-away line: The inhabitants of this country are the miserabilist people in the world. Racial divisions were embedded in Captain Cook's landfalls in Eastern Australia in 1770 and even his earlier visits to Tahiti and New Zealand. Some indigenous people were killed by the crew in a reflexive action against the local population. The Endeavour struck a reef near Cooktown in North Queensland. The Endeavour was beached for repairs. Here the Guugu Yimithirr people lead by Coomen assisted crew members who were ill or disoriented. The crew were offered food and water. However, misunderstandings did occur in the Endeavour River encounter. At least one indigenous person was killed on 17 June 1770 by a member of the Endeavour's crew and perhaps others injured in the unequal skirmish. Despite the assistance offered at Cooktown to the crew of the Endeavour, Captain Cook had orders from the British Crown to take possession of lands deemed to be terra nullius or nobody's land. The momentum of the successive 1967 referendum continued in high court decisions from Mabo v Queensland in 1992 (No1 and 2), and Wik Peoples v Queensland in 1996. Favourable rulings continued in 2002 with Yorta Nation v Victoria (2002) over land and water rights in the Goulburn and Murray River Districts which were upheld by the High Court. Throughout the campaign, the mainstream media largely endorsed this claim of the social and racial divisiveness over acceptance of the Voice proposal. The outcomes of the No campaign are now history. The Guardian (15 October 2023) has detailed results of the Voice Referendum by states, territories and even electorates. There were several electorates with Yes Votes below 20 per cent including the electorates of Maranoa (15.9 per cent) and Flynn (16.4 per cent). In juxtaposition, over thirty seats supported the Yes case with results of strong support for the Yes Case in Melbourne (78.1 per cent) and Grayndler (74.5 per cent). The results of the Voice Referendum were close to the predictions of the best opinion polls as summarized by ABC News. In support of the commitment by Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles to moving forward after a day of infamy for indigenous reconciliation, our political future needs responsible risk-taking to address long-standing divisions particularly in regional and outer suburban areas across Australia. Lack of commitment to indigenous reconciliation is embedded in blind spots about other social, economic and cultural tensions. The Brisbane River forms a divide between the more affluent electorate of Ryan and some of the more challenged precincts in the federal electorate of Blair between Moggill and Riverview. This divide was covered in two of my previous articles for AIM Network in 2017 (here and here). Community leaders have been reluctant to foster better public transport links across the social divide between the more adjacent growth areas on the fringes of Brisbane in the Springfield District and the Ripley Valley and the Ipswich CBD. Similar public transport black-spots exist between Moggill and the northside fringes of Ipswich at Karana Downs (Brisbane), Mt. Crosby, Kholo and Karalee (Ipswich). Historically, Labor leaders from the Ipswich District were adept at responding to the needs of constituents. Even prior to 1900, a Labor member from the Rosewood Coalfields was elected to state parliament. It was more difficult to gain a federal representative because the federal electorate of Moreton extended into rural areas. When federal Labor member, James Wilkinson was defeated in 1906, it took 55 years for veteran Labor leader Bill Hayden to represent Ipswich from 1961. He defeated a popular local LNP minister in the Menzies Government during an unexpected short-term recession associated with the tightening of monetary policy. Despite the controversies like Labor's opposition to the war in Vietnam, Bill Hayden's staff excelled in responding to the concerns within his electorate on mainstream local issues. His vote increased at every election until 1969. There was a close result in 1975 in Oxley after the dismissal of Gough Whitlam but there were strong swings back to Labor as early as 1977. As in other Labor heartland electorates across Australia, support for the Labor Party was insufficient to halt the No campaign with its emphasis on fears of an advisory Voice Council to express the concerns of indigenous communities to federal governments of differing persuasions. There is a significant dichotomy in the results of the Voice referendum between Ryan in Brisbane and Blair. On a divisional basis, there was a No vote of 47.3 per cent in Ryan. In Blair the No vote was 69.8 per cent. The Yes vote achieved good results even in comfortable outer-suburban polling booths in Ryan despite the mortgage stresses facing new home-owners. The Yes vote was strong in in the electorate of Ryan although some mortgage stress was possibly still evident in the results from Brookfield (47.8 per cent) and Moggill (48.3 per cent). Across the federal electoral divide Blair, the Yes vote struggled to exceed 30 per cent at many polling booths. Weak support for the Yes case brought results extended was evident in Riverview (27.6 per cent), Karalee (30.6 per cent) and Tivoli (29.6 per cent) which can be located on the map provided. As expected, the Yes vote dipped in rural and semi-rural areas with a No vote of 85.4 per cent at Tarampa and 78.7 per cent at Walloon, 77.3 per cent in Rosewood township and 80.7 per cent at Grandchester. The Australian constitution is indeed difficult to change. Change is virtually impossible without bipartisan support. The Republic Referendum on 6 November 1999 was not carried in any of the states but succeeded in the ACT with a Yes vote of 63.3 per cent in juxtaposition with a No Vote of 62.6 per cent in Queensland at that time. Only eight of the forty-five referenda options since federation have been carried. Even formation of the Commonwealth of Australia itself prior to 1900 proved to be politically divisive. The federation referendum question had to be put to the all-male NSW electorate on two occasions. WA was a late starter in the constitutional stakes. This colony of the British Empire was omitted from the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 as carried by both houses of the British parliament. Cheers to the remote indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities in electorates like Kennedy and Leichhardt in Queensland who put their faith in the Yes case despite opposition from local LNP and conservative independent members. In the post-Voice era, neoconservative representatives will find it difficult to avoid acting on local concerns about the need for diversity of employment that is compatible with acute local concerns. There are core Labor values which are compatible with a contribution to Northern Development and indigenous reconciliation through water conservation schemes, community development initiatives, infrastructure investment and sustainable programmes to diversify rural and remote economies. Even at the best of times, tourism services into exotic historical, cultural and scenic spots in the Queensland outback during the cooler months were underdeveloped. Opportunities existed for greater indigenous involvement in tourism at places like Boodjamulla (Lawn Hill) National Park. Although the Waanyi people of this national park area received their native title claim in 2010, the proprietor of Adel's Grove relied largely on interstate grey nomads to operate its accommodation and restaurant facilities for guests the last time I visited this site. More than a century ago, Albert de Lestang (1854-1959) had a much deeper commitment to the local savanna ecosystem. He experimented with the introduction of exotic and native plants at Adel's Grove and operated a store for passing tourists. Fire destroyed Albert's dwellings in the 1950s. Fire also destroyed the hub of the accommodation at Adel's Grove out quite recently. The need for greater indigenous involvement in local tourism is essential. With the support of the Queensland government, the Waanyi people negotiated an agreement with the zinc mining operations in this locality which continued until operations ceased temporarily in 2015. A history of the progressive association between mining and the Waanyi people is available online. The monograph was developed by the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining at UQ. Reaching across the political aisle at state and federal levels can assist in overcoming the disappointments of the Voice Referendum results. There are places in North West Queensland which could enthuse tourists during the winter months. The outreach of current tourism access only taps the surface of the vast array of exotic places which dot North West Queensland. Similar resources exist in the Cairns Hinterland and on Cape York from the days when mining activity moved into these remote frontiers even prior to the turn of the last century. The (locally) famous mine tram tunnel at Hightville. This tunnel was built in 1914 for the tram line that carted copper ore from the Wee Macgregor mine down the ridge to the Ballara siding, for rail transport to Townsville via Cloncurry. The Wee Macgregor mine is on the other side of the tunnel from where this photograph was taken. I would not venture through the tunnel if you are afraid of bats, there is quite a colony roosting in there. May 2007. Many potential historic relics spots are on private grazing properties and operated in the federation era (1901-14) prior to the opening of Mt. Isa Mines.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Australian voters have rejected a great opportunity to enshrine commitment to an advisory voice on indigenous people in the Australian constitution. For many older and disadvantaged Australians, the proposed constitutional changes were perceived to be threatening changes. Racial divisions were embedded in Captain Cook's landfalls in Eastern Australia in 1770 and even his earlier visits to Tahiti and New Zealand. At least one indigenous person was killed on 17 June 1770 by a member of the Endeavour's crew and perhaps others injured in the unequal skirmish."

With the situation only set to get worse, what does this mean for Europe and how can it manage the situation? Many citizens across Europe have the luxury of not worrying about how they will access water. But as the planet becomes more populated and demand for water increases - a crisis is pending. So what does this mean and how can Europe manage this precious resource? Two litres of water is enough to satisfy a person's daily drinking needs - but it takes 3,000 litres for food. Meeting this demand is set to become increasingly challenging for agriculture irrigation, which uses up 70 of freshwater worldwide. We import a lot of food and so we are reliant on how water is being managed in other parts of the world, Naho Mirumachi, Professor of Environmental Politics at King's College London told Euronews. Some 3.6 billion people around the world already have inadequate access to water, with the Middle East and Africa most impacted by water scarcity. The food that we are consuming will probably have to increasingly come from other parts of the world as we will no longer be able to produce certain products in Europe because it is getting too hot, Jippe Hoogeveen, senior land and water officer at the UN's Food and Agricultural Agency told Euronews. Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the situation. After three years of low rainfall and high temperatures, the country's national weather service declared a 'long term drought' earlier this year. Some crops may even have to be written off, the Spanish Coordinator of Famers and Ranchers Organizations has even warned. But countries in Northern and Eastern Europe are also increasingly affected by the strain on water supplies. People think that the UK is a rainy country, but actually we have been experiencing droughts as well and places like this provide important agriculture for us, stated Naho Mirumachi. Energy Scarce water resources are not only a threat to agriculture - but also to the energy sector. As we move into a net zero clean energy era, we are moving towards things like hydropower, explained Mirumachi. If we have less water in our rivers, it means that we will not have we will not be able to rely on hydropower. Hydropower plants - which use water to produce electricity or to power machines - are regarded as a sustainable energy alternative fossil-fuel driven facilities do. Population growth As the global population is set to rise to 8.5 billion by 2030, this is driving the strain on water resources. A population which is not only growing - but also consuming more. There is a growing middle class and a diversified consumer. They are going to require more material goods, not just food, but also things like phones that are actually very water intensive. And so it is not just climate change that is forcing these water shortages to occur, explained Naho Mirumachi. Mitigating the strain on water resources means ensuring a secure supply of water for humans - while respecting the environment. There is going to be a knock-on effect on the ecosystems and the health of the rivers. So if you have less water, there might be less biodiversity, which is an important aspect of keeping our environment healthy, stated Mirumachi. What is the EU doing to prevent water shortages? The World Meteorological Organization has warned that the world's water cycle is spinning out of balance, calling for a fundamental policy shift in its 2022 Global Water Resources report. Since 2000 the European Union has sought to address the issue - through the Water Framework Directive - which works to ensure the quality of Europe's waters. However, 90 of river basins in various EU countries will still be unhealthy by 2027, a report published by WWF and the Living Rivers Europe Coalition concluded. According to Nihat Zal, project manager at the European Environmental Agency, Europe's response has been effective - but needs to be accelerated at different scales, at the local level, at the country level, at the EU level, so that the level of preparedness towards the risk uncertainties will also be improved.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"30 of the EU population has been impacted by strained water supplies in recent years.

On Monday the opposition leader all but abandoned his much-criticised suggestion of a second referendum, declining to recommit to the idea and warning that Australians will not want a referendum for some time. The policy will be reviewed by the Coalition senators Kerrynne Liddle and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and leading no campaigner. While the opposition seeks to maximise the political damage by blaming the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, Labor faces calls for an accelerated rollout of the remaining elements of the Uluru statement from the heart, truth telling and treaty making, and an emphasis on practical solutions to close the gap in Indigenous outcomes. The federal cabinet will meet to discuss the Albanese government's next steps to address Indigenous disadvantage, with senior government figures favouring an interim listening mechanism to provide advice directly to the prime minister. Dutton said: We said that the question put to the Australian people should have been on recognition and dropped the voice because people supported recognition but not the voice. The prime minister did not do that. The prime minister embarked on a divisive path, Dutton told reporters in Canberra. He spent 400m of taxpayers money. He was warned not to go down this path of division and he bears the responsibility for where our country is today. Asked about his policy for a second referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution, Dutton said look, all of our policy ... is going to be reviewed in the process Kerrynne and Jacinta will lead now. I think that is important, but I think it is clear that the Australian public is probably over the referendum process for some time. Dutton said that millions of Australians at the moment are hurting because the prime minister has been completely obsessed with the voice over the course of the last 16 or 17 months. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the referendum was not a vote against reconciliation, the referendum was not a vote against closing the gap. If you look at the way in which both the yes and no cases were argued, we can take from the referendum an increased resolve to act on closing the gap and to act on reconciliation, Marles told reporters in Canberra. And that is really what we need to take forward now, and in a sense of unity across the country. Although more than 60 of Australians voted no to the voice, opponents came to that position from a variety of perspectives: from shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Price's claim that there were no ongoing negative impacts from colonisation, to independent senator Lidia Thorpe's case that a no vote would advance Blak sovereignty. Those contradictions continued on Monday in a train-wreck interview by the leading no campaigner Warren Mundine, who has caused consternation among conservatives by calling for treaties with Australia's First Nations. Asked about his position on treaties, Mundine told Radio National that Indigenous Australians were in one sense recognised through land rights and through native title. Treaty has to be with the traditional owner nations and it is got nothing to do with sovereignty, he claimed, even though recognition of First Nations sovereignty is an integral part of treaties. Mundine appeared to conflate treaties with other agreements struck between groups of Indigenous people and private enterprise, whether it is governments or state and territories, in building roads, building rail ... building houses, or getting projects and mining and energy and agriculture or whatever else. Mundine said that voters did want to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the constitution as the first people of Australia but they rejected the voice. Mundine said that he would love symbolic constitutional recognition and polling suggested that 90 of Australians agreed. But the issue we got, and we all know this, is that that is the leadership of the Aboriginal community ... they do not want it and that so that is going to be a problem. Asked if constitutional recognition would happen, Mundine replied: Well, I do not know to be honest. What we got to do is do something that the government failed to do, that Albanese failed to do, and that is get everyone onboard for things to happen. The influential crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie criticised Indigenous leaders behind the Uluru statement for taking a week of silence to grieve the result. You need to come out and fight now - come out and say to the leader of this country 'what are you going to do for Indigenous communities out there?', Lambie told Sky News. But having a week's break - not on guys, you need to stand your ground now, you need to come out and say 'you have put us on a bloody life support for two years while you have been trying to sell this voice, and in the meantime you have done nothing in the Indigenous communities out there. The Greens have called for the government to establish a national truth and justice commission. Lambie labelled truth-telling a talkfest.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Peter Dutton has dramatically walked back his offer to symbolically recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution.

Two people were killed and three more injured in the Kherson area after more than 100 shells bombarded the region over the weekend, local Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on social media. Two guided bombs later hit key infrastructure in Kherson city, sparking a partial blackout and disruption to the area's water supply, reported the head of the city's military administration, Roman Mrochko. Local officials said two more people had died in the Donetsk area and that a 57-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman had been killed by an airstrike that destroyed their home in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine launched 27 drones in an overnight attack on western Russia, the Russian defense ministry announced, Sunday. Officials said that 18 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, while, they said, two more drones had been shot down over Russia's Belgorod region. They did not detail the fate of the remaining seven drones. Ukrainian media outlets later said that Kyiv's forces had carried out a successful strike on Russia's Krasnaya Yaruga electrical substation, close to the Ukrainian border. The reports could not independently verified. Fierce clashes continued across eastern Ukraine over the weekend, as Russian forces repeatedly tried to encircle the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, military officials said. Illia Yevlash, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's eastern forces, told journalists that Ukrainian forces in the area had faced 10 separate attacks in the space of 24 hours. The enemy is trying to attack us in the direction of Kupiansk to encircle it and reach the banks of the Oskol River, Yevlash told Ukrainian television. He said that Ukrainian forces in the town of Lyman in the Donetsk region had also faced heavy attack. Russian offensive Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that Russian forces are conducting an active defense and are improving their position along the entire length of the line of contact with Ukrainian forces, calling it an active defense. 'And our troops are improving their position at almost the entire area. Quite a large area, Putin said in a video posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist. Russian forces continue to attack Ukrainian positions around the town of Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region in Moscow's largest offensive in months. The General Staff of Ukraine's military said on October 15 its forces had repelled 15 Russian attacks near Avdiivka as well as in Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region. 'The adversary keeps trying to break through Ukrainian defenses, to no success,' it said on Facebook. US military aid The administration of YOU.S. President Joe Biden hopes to push through Congress a new weapons package putting together aid for Israel and Ukraine that will be significantly higher than 2 billion. In an interview on CBS's 'Face the Nation show, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the president will conduct extensive talks with Congress this week on the need for the package to be approved. Biden has been considering a budget request lumping together aid for Israel, Ukraine possibly Taiwan, and the YOU.S. southern border to improve the chances of getting it approved amid calls from some Republicans to cut money for Kyiv. Asked whether the request would be for 2 billion, as has been previously reported, Sullivan said, 'Well, the number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat.' It is not clear how any bill would move through Congress without a speaker of the House of Representatives. Republicans are struggling to pick a speaker after party hardliners ousted Kevin McCarthy nearly two weeks ago. Members must elect a new speaker before they conduct any legislative work. Rail logistics Rail logistics remain a vital component in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the British defense ministry said Sunday in its daily intelligence update, adding that Russia uses its rail system for transportation of ammunition, armor, fuel and personnel into the country. At the same time, it said, rail facilities in occupied parts of Ukraine are vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery, missiles and sabotage. The ministry said Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication.

China Sea,"Last week, a Philippine Navy supply ship had a close encounter with a Chinese corvette just off the coast of Thitu Island, a Philippine-controlled natural island on the western edge of the Spratly archipelago. On Friday, the 1944-built tank landing ship BRP Benguet was under way about six nautical miles south of the base at Thitu Island, headed south for the remote Philippine station at Rizal Reef (Commodore Reef). Her mission was to resupply the garrison and provide for rotation of personnel. According to the Philippine Navy, a Chinese naval vessel with the pennant number 621 (the PLA Navy corvette Panzhihua) approached to within 80 yards. The Panzhihua then moved to cut across Benguet's bow at a distance of 350 yards. The crew of the Benguet warned off the Chinese warship with radio challenges, and a video of the scene shows that Panzhihua appeared to change course. The Panzhihua's crew responded to the radio contact by citing China's invalidated ten-dash line claim (formerly nine-dash line). China claims sovereignty over the vast majority of the South China Sea, including large swathes of neighboring states' exclusive economic zones (EEZs). The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that these claims were inconsistent with international law, but China has ignored the ruling. As a legally-recognized island, Thitu generates a 12-mile territorial sea. The location provided by the Philippine Navy suggests that the interaction occurred in sovereign Philippine waters, not just in the Philippine EEZ. These dangerous and offensive maneuvers by China's PLAN not only risk collision but also directly endanger the lives of maritime personnel from both sides. The AFP remains committed to ensuring the safety of its personnel during rotation and replenishment missions and asserts that it will continue to adhere to the rules-based international order, AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said in a statement. BRP Banguet (ex name USS Daviess County  LST-692) is a World War II tank landing ship built by Jeffersonville Boat  Machine Company in 1944. She participated in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, and later saw action in the Korean War.

Andrew Miller, 56 from Northamptonshire, parked his automatic Citroen DS 3 on the ground floor of Luton Airport's Terminal Car Park 2 in the blue badge parking zone on October 8, before taking a trip to Ireland with his husband, Tim Meacock, also 56. They returned to the airport on Thursday afternoon, and Mr Miller, who has a complex spinal condition and has always been a wheelchair user, said there was no one from the airport or APCOA, its parking provider, to give him information on how to return home. Mr Miller, a broadcaster, cultural consultant and disability campaigner, said the situation has been a nightmare and accused the airport and APCOA of corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind. Andrew Miller (left) said he spent 'years finding a car which would meet his 'complex access needs (Andrew MillerPA) It comes as Luton Airport said on Sunday it was unlikely that any vehicles will be salvageable following the car fire which broke out on Tuesday, causing the site to collapse. Mr Miller said he could see his vehicle from the car park appearing to be relatively undamaged, and he was concerned the airport could be rushing to conclusions. In response to Mr Miller's situation, a spokesperson for London Luton Airport offered sincere apologies for any distress or inconvenience caused. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence, Mr Miller told the PA news agency. Andrew Miller said the vehicle, a DS 3 Citroen, is 'bespoke to his access needs (Andrew MillerPA) As a wheelchair user, I have got complex access needs and I have spent years looking for a car that I can easily get in and out of. Mr Miller said he bought his automatic Citroen DS 3 outright two weeks ago after leasing the vehicle for five years from Motability, an organisation which supports disabled drivers. The vehicle model is no longer in production, going off-sale in 2019, with Mr Miller saying: It is quite bespoke and precious to me and it really is my independence. He said the vehicle, a three-door car without a central console, is much easier for a wheelchair user to get in and out of independently, adding: It is going to be very difficult for me to find another one, not impossible, but very difficult. This fire has robbed me of my access and my independence Andrew Miller, Luton Airport passenger He has also fitted hand controls to the vehicle, explaining they are connected to the brake and accelerator to allow someone without the use of their legs to operate the car, adding they would cost about 500 to replace. Mr Miller said he wrote to APCOA twice, as well as posting on X, formerly Twitter, to ask Luton Airport for information on how he could return home on his arrival at the airport, but had no response. Mr Miller said when he landed at the airport he was assisted by the chaplain, who is part of the support service and available to assist those in difficulty and was exceptionally kind and patient and helped arrange a taxi for the couple to return home. In my view, it was corporate cowardice and negligence of the worst kind, he said. The whole thing has been a nightmare and proves to me that in a major incident situation like this, the interests of disabled people who need carefully considered bespoke solutions get tossed aside and ignored. Of Luton Airport's statement on Sunday, Mr Miller said he was concerned they (the airport) might be rushing to conclusions if cars like mine are potentially salvageable. Who knows what damage it might have sustained, I have got no idea what the vehicle looks like up close, but from a distance, it encouraged me that it was not in the collapsed part of the car park, he said. Mr Miller hopes he will be able to get a replacement vehicle from his insurer from Tuesday. A London Luton Airport spokesperson said: We would like to offer our sincere apologies to Mr Miller for any distress or inconvenience caused. We understand how upsetting this situation is and have been working tirelessly to provide more information to our customers as quickly as possible. Since Tuesday evening, together with APCOA parking, we have responded to almost 16,500 customer queries. Dealing with such a large volume of inquiries, while an investigation is ongoing, has naturally extended our response times. The airport chaplaincy team are part of the airport response to major incidents and are equipped to provide support and assistance. We are delighted they were able to arrange alternative transport for Mr Miller on this occasion. They continued: We recognise this has been an extremely distressing time for all concerned and we would like to thank our customers for their ongoing patience and understanding while we work through the many complexities following this incident. Our team have been tirelessly working around the clock to keep customers informed of developments. Given the scale of the damage, it is unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable. However, this is still in the process of being assessed. We are also working with the Association of British Insurers on behalf of the many insurance companies to establish whether it will be possible to safely retrieve any personal possessions and, if so, how this process may work.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Andrew Miller, 56, parked his Citroen DS 3 at Luton Airport on October 8.

Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in retaliation for a rampage in which its fighters stormed through Israeli towns a week ago, shooting civilians and seizing scores of hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Israel has faced heavy rocket barrages including in the south of the country, which has prompted the closure of the smaller Ashkelon port, which is the nearest terminal to Gaza. Ashdod port has imposed restrictions on the transport of hazardous materials which has meant slower transits. The port said in its latest statement posted on its website that it continued to operate as normal even under wartime, adding that it was prepared to continue to supply Israel's economy with everything that was needed around the clock to ensure the population did not experience shortages. At least three cargo and dry bulk ships carrying cargo bound for Ashdod had stopped in waters nearby, with a further three vessels including an oil tanker and a container ship heading for the port, data from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic showed on Sunday. Around 13 ships - comprising cargo, container and dry bulk vessels - were currently moored inside Ashdodport, according to MarineTraffic data. At least three laden dry bulk ships were waiting off Haifa in northern Israel, separate data showed. Haifa and Ashdod are Israel's biggest and most vital ports. The Port of Haifa, which handles multiple cargo segments including dry bulk goods, said on Sunday it was working continuously and also throughout the weekend. The activity has been reinforced to the maximum possible, within the operational and manpower limitations, in order to receive cargo of all types, including cargo that was diverted from the direction of Ashdod and unloaded at the Port of Haifa, it said in a statement. Leading container shipping line MSC said last week there were increased waiting times at Ashdod due to increased security checks and labor shortages and circumstances are subject to change at very short notice at Israeli ports. Israel's Economy Ministry said separately on Thursday there was a shortage on manpower making it harder to transport and replenish inventories due to higher consumption, although there was no shortage of supplies and urged people not to hoard food. There will be zero tolerance for price gouging, the ministry said. Wait times for ships docking in Israel have on average traditionally been much longer than in other ports. The government in recent years has been privatizing its ports and opening new ports in a bid to increase competition and efficiencies. Marine war insurance rates have surged more than ten fold since the attacks last week and some underwriters were reviewing cover provisions for Ashdod although Haifa remained unaffected, industry sources said. While Ashdod and Haifa ports account for just 0.4 of global container throughput, any expansion of hostilities beyond Israel's border could introduce risks to vital shipping chokepoints in the region, online logistics platform Container xChange said. The Suez Canal, a critical waterway for various commercial vessels, including container ships, may face disruptions, Container xChange CEO Christian Roeloffs said. Similarly, the Strait of Hormuz, a backbone for oil and gas shipping, could be affected. However, the extent of these effects will largely depend on the conflict's expansion and duration. The Marshall Islands registry, one of the world's top shipping flags, last week raised the security level for Israel's ports and its territorial waters to their highest. Threat of collateral damage to merchant vessels has increased significantly, the registry said in an advisory. Vessels with links to Israel or the United States may be under heightened threat of attack within Israeli territorial waters, the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman and Red Sea areas.

Indeed, this has been the main theme from Fed speakers despite US inflation figures suggesting a certain degree of stickiness persists in the core services sector. The grinding higher of longer-dated Treasury yields is amplifying the monetary policy tightening with Boston Fed President Susan Collins arguing this is generating some tightening of financial conditions. If it persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term. The market is currently pricing in a one-third chance of a final 25bp rate hike this year and that could decline further if we are right and the details of the retail sales and industrial production report show evidence of weakness. Headline retail sales will be lifted by higher vehicle sales and higher gasoline prices, but strip these out and it is likely to be a far weaker report. High-frequency credit card spending numbers have been soft in September and that is normally a good barometer of direction for general spending trends. The Fed's Beige Book and the minutes of the FOMC meeting also mentioned growing evidence of household savings being run down and in an environment where real household disposable income has been shrinking, the pressure on household finances is growing. Industrial production may show a modest rise in manufacturing, but the risks are skewed to the downside from auto-related strike action which has not only impacted vehicle production but also hurt suppliers. Lower oil and gas drilling could also weigh on total industrial production, as will utilities. Also watch the Fed's new updated Beige Book for anecdotal evidence of a further softening in activity. Last time, they mentioned concerns about the prospects for consumer discretionary spending while commenting that the last stage of pent-up demand for leisure travel from the pandemic era was likely over. Meanwhile, housing data will soften further with very weak pending home sales pointing to existing home sales dropping below a 4mn annualised rate, which was last seen during the global financial crisis. Mortgage rates are fast approaching 8 and this will also hurt home builder sentiment and limit the upside for housing starts. Canada: hot CPI data will make rate hike more likely Just to mention briefly that in Canada, CPI will be closely followed given the uncertainty over whether the Bank of Canada will hike again at the end of this month. A hot print could make it close to a 50-50 call. Currently, there is a one third chance priced in. Poland: minimum wage growth boosts average wages Industrial output (September): -3.8 YoY New manufacturing orders continue to shrink, albeit at a slower pace. We forecast that manufacturing output in September was substantially below levels seen a year earlier, partially as a result of the lower number of working days this year. Global trade and conditions in German industry remain unfavourable, but recent PMI readings suggest some signs of stability and chances for improvement ahead. PPI (September): -3.4 YoY Despite an upswing in global crude oil prices and the zloty weakening against the US dollar last month, wholesale gasoline and diesel prices declined markedly in September (down by around 6.5 month-on-month on average). We project prices in other key sectors of manufacturing declined as well, driving producer prices down by 0.4 MoM, and pushing headline PPI inflation down 3.4 YoY. Deflation is expected to continue in the coming months. Wages (September): 10.2 YoY Average wages and salaries in the enterprise sector are projected to have eased to 10.2 year-on-year in September from 11.9 YoY amid a higher reference base and lower number of working days, which should translate into slower growth of wages in manufacturing. Demand for labour is cooling down in some sectors of the economy but remains solid in various services. At the same time, minimum wage growth is putting upward pressure on average wages. Employment (September): 0.0 YoY Employment in the enterprise sector has stopped growing in recent months. We forecast a slight decline in the level of employment in monthly terms which should not have an impact overall. Despite poor economic conditions, there are no substantial lay-offs in the economy as labour is scarce due to supply-side factors. The working-age population is shrinking and some of the immigrants are leaving Poland. Retail sales (September): -2.0 YoY Falling inflation and strongly rising nominal wages are translating into improving real disposable income of households. As a result, we see some green shoots in retail sales and expect a turnaround in the coming months. We forecast that in September, retail sales fell by 2.0 YoY vs. -2.7 YoY in August. Consumers seem to be finally close to finding solid ground after a long period of freefall.

ASHDOD, Israel -- Israel's military have called Yahya Sinwar a dead man walking, and while preparations for a ground invasion on Gaza gather pace, the hunt for Hamas' leader in the enclave also appears to be on. He chose to send the butchers into our bedrooms to kill our babies, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, told NBC News Saturday. And when they chose to go full front against Israel, they signed their own death warrant. A dead man walking. We will get to that to man. Sinwar is believed to be hiding in the labyrinth of tunnels used by Hamas militants in Gaza to conceal weapons, fighters and hostages, Israeli officials have said. But he was a wanted man long before Hamas militants launched a coordinated terrorist attack on kibbutzim, music festivals and city streets on October 7, seen by Israeli security officials as one of their most ruthless enemies. Born in a Gaza refugee camp in the early 1960s, Sinwar joined Hamas after it was founded in 1987, gaining a reputation for brutality after he reportedly helped to form the militant group's internal security force, according a profile of him by European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. Captured by Israel two years later, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in killing Israeli troops and Palestinian collaborators. But being behind bars did not stop him from rising through the ranks of the group, and it also gave him the opportunity to learn to speak Hebrew -- the language of his enemies. Sinwar was released in 2011, one of more than 1,000 Palestinian freed in exchange for one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was taken hostage by Hamas and held for five years. At the time emotions were mixed over the lopsided exchange, which allowed other violent prisoners to walk free. His prison experience may have made Sinwar particularly sensitive to the plight of Palestinian inmates and likely explains his approval of such a large-scale operation to abduct hostages, according to Michael Horowitz, geopolitical and security analyst. One of his first known attacks against Israel was the abduction of two Israelis soldiers, said Horowitz, the head of intelligence at Le Beck International, adding that Sinwar has been promising to free prisoners ever since he was elected as the head of Hamas in Gaza in a secret ballot in 2017. After taking over from former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Sinwar attempted to improve relations with Egypt and Fatah, the faction that has control of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank which is seen as more secular and moderate, according to the ECFR report. He also attempted to pressure Israel into loosening its military blockade on Gaza with a public diplomacy campaign and, at the same time, organizing and sanctioning wide-scale Palestinian protests at the Israeli border, Horowitz said. In 2018, Sinwar told The New York Times that Palestinians would prefer to earn our rights by soft and peaceful means but they were also entitled to earn them by resistance. But having seemingly made little progress with this strategy, Sinwar recently faced notable opposition in an internal Hamas election, Horowitz said. This may have pushed him to go back to full-scale confrontation, he said, adding that Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, was known as a hardliner. It was Deif who masterminded the land, sea and air attacks on Israel, which he called al-Aqsa Flood. Sinwar's diplomacy efforts cannot be discounted as an intentional disinformation campaign by Hamas, according H.A. Hellyer, a geopolitics and security specialist at the Royal United Services Institute, a London based think tank. We had the impression a number of times that Hamas was not interested in confrontation, not interested in escalation or was trying to figure out another way of doing things, he said, adding that the latest attacks showed that this had not been the overarching priority of key figures in Hamas. Even the reports that indicate that there were some warnings, nobody knew that this was what was being planned, Hellyer said. I am not even sure, frankly, if Hamas foretold or foresaw quite how much damage they would be able to wreak. And of course, not all of Hamas knew what was going on anyway. Israel's ground offensive is not just a hunt for Sinwar, but a mission to eradicate all of Hamas' governing power within Gaza, Hellyer said, adding that this would put many innocent Palestinian lives at risk. Combining that with an incredibly densely populated area, which has limited food, electricity cuts, water deprivation, fuel deprivation, it is already in the midst of humanitarian catastrophe and I think that is going to intensify in an exponential manner, he said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Yahya Sinwar was seen by Israeli security officials as one of their most ruthless enemies.

DAILY POST recalls that the police in Borno had on Saturday arrested some personnel of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC). The Police also alleged that the arrested personnel could not identify themselves and accused them of attempting to steal train coaches. The Union, through its National President, Mr Innocent Ajiji, disclosed this while addressing journalists in Jos, the Plateau State capital, on Sunday. Ajiji, who faulted the move, maintained that the arrested persons were bonafide personnel of the corporation. He explained that the coaches were being moved to Jos for the commencement of train services by NRC in Plateau. I am in Jos to monitor the ongoing activities because the Plateau State Government has the intention of running a rail mass transit that will cover Jos, Kuru and Heipang areas. But we do not have any coach in Jos, and as a result, coaches are being conveyed from Maiduguri to be refurbished and used to run the mass transit here. The remaining coaches will be taken to another location because railway management has the intention to run inter-state mass transit. The first coach has arrived in Jos by road and this is because our tracks have been stolen, and we cannot convey the coaches by rail, he said. The president alleged that its members were arrested at the point of conveying the coaches on the directive of Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno State. He explained that the persons arrested were acting on the directive of the management of NRC, adding that it officially wrote to the Commissioner of Police in Borno State, notifying him of the need to convey its items from Maiduguri to Jos. Our members went to Maiduguri to convey three other coaches to Jos, but the police arrested them, and as we speak, they are in custody. All efforts to release them proved abortive. The police alleged that those coaches were stolen, but that is not true. The person they are alleging that he is the prime suspect is Engr Aliyu Mainasara, our Regional District Manager in the North-East. He is not a thief and so we call on the commissioner to immediately release our members, and we will be forced to down tools and stop all trains all over Nigeria from moving if this is not done, he said. Ajiji also explained that the coaches have not been put to use for the past 20 years, insisting that they were being transferred to Jos for proper utilisation. Since Boko Haram started, all our tracks were carted away by the insurgents; our bridges were all also destroyed. In fact, from Maiduguri to Bajoga, there is no single track on the ground because they have been carted away by these criminals. So, we are bringing these coaches to Jos and other places to put them to proper use, he said.

Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has now received a report about the blaze on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park on Tuesday. Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said up to 1,500 vehicles were inside the car park at the time of the fire. In a statement, the airport said it is 'unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable' but this was 'still in the process of being assessed'. One hundred firefighters spent 12 hours battling the inferno at the airport's Terminal Car Park Two when the 20million block was engulfed by flames and caved in just before 9pm this week. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has received a report about the blaze on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park on Tuesday This week's fire rapidly engulfed the parking structure, which had 1,500 cars in at the time The fire caused part of the car park to completely collapse and left the structure unsafe to enter The airport said it had provided the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) with the registration details of 1,405 vehicles and, along with its parking provider APCOA, it had responded to almost 16,500 customer queries since the fire. The car park remains closed after the blaze caused it to partially collapse, and it was revealed on Saturday that no-one can access the structure safely, making it impossible to properly assess the damage done. It has been extensively damaged by the fire, with debris of cars piled up within the blackened structure. The airport's Dart rail transit system, which opened earlier this year, remains closed. Investigators believe the blaze was started when a diesel car, thought to be a Range Rover, suffered an electrical fault or leaking fuel line. In a statement, London Luton Airport apologised to customers with vehicles in the car park, which is a five-minute walk from the airport's terminal. It said: 'We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car parking customers, and that many are still anxious for more detail.

The airport said the emergency services have handed back control of the site and it is working to make it safe. It is likely that Terminal Car Park 2, which was built in 2019 at a cost of 20million, will now have to be demolished. Experts believe that if it had been fitted with an effective sprinkler system, the fire could have been stopped from spreading, leading only to localised damage. A government source confirmed to MailOnline that they are 'undertaking a major review of the fire safety guidance to the building regulations, including research on the fire resistance of car parks'.

I have been conditioned to act and behave in a very specific way, said Avant. I try to do my hair. I make sure I shower, have nice clothes. Sometimes I put on my University of Michigan shirt. It is a strategy to combat discrimination the 42-year-old photographer of Mesquite, Texas, has developed over a lifetime of managing her sickle cell disease, a rare blood disorder that affects an estimated 100,000 Americans. The hereditary condition can affect a person of any race or ethnicity, but Black patients, like Avant, make up the majority of those afflicted in the YOU.S. For people living with the disease, a sickle cell crisis can happen at any time. When it does, their rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells become stuck in their blood vessels, blocking flow and causing extreme pain or breathing difficulties. A crisis can escalate into life-threatening complications such as strokes, seizures, and sepsis. When a pain crisis cannot be managed at home, patients head to the ER to access the high dosage of opioids they need, in addition to IVs to help with dehydration or even blood transfusions. Yet staffers in emergency departments -- already overextended and grappling with nursing shortages -- do not always have experience in treating the rare disease. Doctors, amid a still-raging opioid crisis, remain resistant to prescribing the painkillers necessary to treat sickle cell crises. So, patients say, they face long delays before receiving essential care, plus discrimination and suspicion that they are seeking drugs to get high. I have to look like I am not coming in here off the street looking for medication, said Avant. I have to put on an entire show to get you to believe that I need care. Years of research have documented the delays. A study published in 2013 found that patients seeking care from 2003 through 2008 at an ER for their sickle cell crises experienced 50 longer wait times than patients who arrived at ERs with broken legs or arms. A study published in 2021 found that 50 of sickle cell patients reported having to wait at least two hours before their pain was treated, despite medical guidelines recommending such patients in crisis receive their first dose of pain medication no more than 60 minutes after arriving at the ER. Medical associations such as the American Society of Hematology, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Emergency Nurses Association have established guidelines for emergency department-based care of sickle cell pain. And, in 2021, the Emergency Department Sickle Cell Care Coalition, a national collaboration of hematologists, pharmacists, and nurses, helped launch a point-of-care tool to help medical professionals manage the disease in the ER. But patients and sickle cell experts said those best practices have not been widely adopted. A 2020 survey of nearly 250 emergency medicine providers found that 75 of them were unaware of the NHLBI's recommendations, first published in 2014, yet 98 felt confident in their ability to treat patients with sickle cell disease. Still, ER horror stories abound among adults with sickle cell disease. For Lesly Chavez, 29, a Houston hairstylist, her worst experience occurred a few years ago. She said she spent four hours in a waiting room before getting seen. And when they finally got to me, they told me they could help with 'my addiction,' but they decided that there was nothing that they could do for me, Chavez said. They just flat-out said 'no' and sent me home while I was in crisis. Chavez said she has since avoided that hospital even though it is 10 minutes from her home. Now she drives to a different ER, 30 minutes away. Chavez, who is Hispanic, said that she confronts doubt everywhere I go because sickle cell disease primarily affects Black Americans. (Those who are Hispanic can be of any race.) Paula Tanabe, a professor of nursing at Duke University, who has spent decades researching ways to improve care for sickle cell patients, said a confluence of factors adds to the racial bias patients may face. Emergency rooms are incredibly overcrowded, at rates that we have never seen before, and that is for everyone, said Tanabe. Legislators are trying to help. One federal bill introduced in June would allocate 8.2 million annually for five years to a program that trains doctors on best practices for caring for sickle cell patients. Another, introduced this spring, would provide funding for community organizations working to spread awareness about the condition and give student loan relief to medical providers who commit to working on the disease. Some state legislatures have established sickle cell task forces to improve physician education and care coordination. Advocates for sickle cell patients said investment in data collection to track the disease is also important. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some 100,000 Americans have it, the true number is unknown. That is because no national system exists to collect data on sickle cell, unlike other conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's. I am 32 and we have been saying it is 100,000 my entire life, said Quannecia McCruse, who co-founded the Sickle Cell Association of Houston. I know there is more. I know people are going uncounted. Eleven state-led data collection programs currently exist and, in February, the CDC opened a new grant application for additional states. Improved data would allow funding to be allocated toward the areas with the greatest need, sickle cell patient advocates said. Texas had an opportunity to join those efforts. This spring, the state legislature passed a bill with broad bipartisan support to create a sickle cell patient registry, but Republican Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed it, saying it would compromise patient privacy. That was a bad excuse, said McCruse. We have a cancer registry already, and everyone is information is safe. That registry would have gone a long way to help. While progress grinds slowly, patients like McCruse say they are forced to balance advocating for themselves during bouts of excruciating pain against the need not to irritate or alienate hospital staffers. It feels like someone is taking a Taser and shocking the crap out of me. Or when it is really bad, and it feels like shards of glass are just moving through my veins, said the mother of two. It is very, very painful. And you are telling somebody whose body is torturing them that it is not that bad? Alexis Thompson, a hematologist who treats sickle cell patients at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said she works with her pediatric patients to develop self-advocacy skills. But sometimes that backfires. The great irony is patients who are well informed and capable of self-advocating are being accused of being manipulative, because they are capable of articulating very clearly what is effective for them down to the name of the medication or the absolute dose, Thompson said. Sickle cell experts recommend that doctors adhere to a patient's individual pain plan, if available. Thompson said those plans, which document patients' diagnoses alongside a recommended medication and dosage, can be uploaded to online portals that patients can pull up on their cellphones when visiting an ER to verify what they need. Patients such as Avant hope such steps can help decrease their ER waits while easing their anxiety about seeking emergency care. I do not fear dying, said Avant, but I do fear dying in the hospital.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Heather Avant has sickle cell disease, a rare blood disorder that affects an estimated 100,000 Americans.

The Federal Government should look into the possibility of reviving the rail system to revamp our socio-economic activities. This rail terminus in Maiduguri has a history of enhancing trans-Sahara activities with neighbouring countries of Niger, Chad and Cameroon. This administration will not allow such action. We are representatives of the Federal Government in Borno. If the NRC wanted to engage in such activity, it ought to have informed the state government or even sensitise our people about the move.

And the mainstream media suffered a collective conniption. What will they ever find to write or complain about? (On second thought, give them a few days to circle in on another victim.) He leaves office with the latest poll indicating a commanding two-party preferred lead for Labor of 56.5-43.5 -- an increase on its 55-45 lead at the last election. Unsurprisingly, Andrews has done it in his own time and on his own terms -- a feature of his premiership. Not for Andrews the wishy-washy, let us try to please everybody, starting with the media, approach. He knew - as all progressive politicians would do well to note - there is no pleasing Australia's rabid media cabal. Back when the state needed to come together during COVID, the Murdoch-led rags and shock jocks sided with the Liberal Opposition rabble to attack every state public health measure. Matthew Guy, the cookers and the bloody uproar against Dan Andrews Matthew Guy's Liberals, their cooker friends and accompanying media protection racket have run a cheap anti-Dan Andrews election campaign in Victoria, but will it make a difference? Of course, the more Andrews refused to engage with their relentless attacks, the more enraged the media mafia became. They ramped up the crazy to collaborate with cookers. They invented conspiracy theories on a daily basis, contriving wild sub-plots of cover-ups behind everything from the serious accident in which Andrews suffered a broken back to a car accident involving his wife back in 2013. And proving once and for all that the national broadcaster can mix it with the right-wing media gang, ABC's News Breakfast chose UAP Senator Ralph Babet, along with The Australian's Rachel Baxendale to share their insights on Andrews' departure. Baxendale's blatantly hateful and puerile attacks on the Victorian Premier became a regular feature of Spring Street press conferences. The Murdoch employee refers to those Victorians who reelected Andrews for a third time with an increased majority as the Dan Andrews cult and will likely win a Walkley for her incisive interviewing skills. Such as when she asked the Premier why intimate partners did not have to wear masks when others did, to which Andrews patiently responded: The very nature of a platonic relationship between two people who are coming together to spend time with each other, that is very different to intimate partners who by the very virtue of the fact that they are intimate partners, their contact is of a different nature. I cannot quite believe I am having to explain that. But I am. And this inspired line of questioning: BAXENDALE: I have been told that then-Victorian deputy chief health officer Allen Cheng has resigned, is that true? ANDREWS: No, that is not true. BAXENDALE: But you said he was taking some time off, surely you can see that looks like he is resigned, would not you agree? ANDREWS: No, that is just not correct. Cheng took a total of one week's leave. Brilliant interrogations such as these notwithstanding, Dan Andrews somehow managed to turn up every day during the pandemic. He fronted a hostile press pack, enduring what can only be described as feral attacks on a daily basis. He faced an Opposition focused on getting the dirt on the Premier instead of providing a credible alternative government. There were death threats from emboldened far-right nut jobs. And a bellicose Federal Coalition Government and later, Opposition, who, even as late as this month, blamed Andrews for all that is wrong with the nation - nay, the world - plus a couple of things that probably have not happened yet. It was an unrelenting, coordinated misinformation campaign, in which conservative forces threw everything they had at the Victorian Premier for nine years, insisting Victorians wanted him out. And the more unhinged their attacks towards him while Andrews stared them down, the more voters turned away from the whole circus, returning the Andrews Government to power with an increased majority each time. Dan Andrews 'right to go' for third term Despite conservative media relentlessly campaigning against his success, Daniel Andrews' potential re-election in November would make him Victoria's longest-serving premier since 1972. It has been a long-held position of this publication that all non-conservative, let alone progressive, politicians should stop cosying up to their tormentors. It only ends in tears. With the announcement of Rupert Murdoch's retirement this week, sitting Labor MPs, while they have not waxed lyrical about the man, have hardly been openly critical, with many choosing to give him credit for building a media empire. Which is a bit like thanking Dr No for creating jobs for MI6. It would have been refreshing to see a sitting Labor MP step up and acknowledge what only ex-PMs, like Malcolm Turnbull (though not while he was Prime Minister), seem bold enough to admit about the media mogul. Turnbull listed the YOU.S. Capitol insurrection, the Trump Presidency and climate change denial among the many terrifying consequences of Murdoch's involvement, and described his legacy as one which: ...has done enormous damage to the democratic world. Turnbull also noted, unlike many of his party's ebullient praise for the Murdoch dynasty, that the passing of Rupert's media monstrosity helm to son Lachlan, will probably not see any change for the better. An accurate if sobering thought. Andrews leaves the top job in the state as the fourth-longest-serving Victorian premier. His legacy is one of significant social reforms such as a Treaty with Indigenous Victorians, the Safe Schools program and Voluntary Assisted Dying legislation. The Andrews Government infrastructure program has transformed Victoria and included the revival of the State Electricity Commission, the metro rail link, railway level crossing removals, the suburban rail loop, a range of road extensions and upgrades, plus a comprehensive plan to build 800,000 affordable homes over ten years. Andrews' policy platform actively embraced renewable energies rather than fossil fuels and, in a first for Australia, permanently banned fracking and coal seam gas exploration. Most recently, the Victorian Premier decided to scrap the outdated Commonwealth Games and ignored the backlash, saying simply: What is become clear is that the cost of hosting these Games in 2026 is not the 2.6 billion, which was budgeted and allocated... I will not take money out of hospitals and schools to host an event that is three times the cost estimated and budgeted for last year. But not everyone will agree with that. Of course, Andrews is not the only successful Labor leader in recent history to have survived the Murdochracy. Mark McGowan, the WA Labor Premier who all but destroyed the Liberal Opposition in that state, such that they almost did not qualify as a political party, had a similar approach to Andrews. He, too, led on his own terms, sticking to the plan and letting that state's media ramble on without effect until he was good and ready to stand down. Interestingly, neither leader can be said to be a beacon of radicalism, which hints at the level of progress Australians are happy to embrace. Nonetheless, Andrews and McGowan are tangible evidence that Australians are sick of spin. They are tired of being played by the Murdochs and Costellos and Stokes' of the world and they are fed up with political grifters who suck up to them for personal gain. Voters want political leaders who prioritise decisions based on the needs of the people, not to placate media moguls and assorted corporations. But not everyone will agree with that.

Israeli military did not confirm the airport attack but said it had struck targets in Syria as it fired back following air raid sirens in two villages in northern Israel and the Golan Heights. Hamas announced on Sunday that three of its members from Lebanon had been killed after crossing the border from Lebanon into Israel. The group said in a statement that its militants had inflicted losses before being targeted by Israeli airstrikes Israel's military warned in a statement on its website on Saturday night it is preparing to implement a wide range of offensive operative plans involving air, ground and naval forces. No time has been put on when the offensive will begin, but a military spokesman said Israel will strike Gaza City very soon. In an address on Saturday night, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari issued a new appeal to residents to move to the southern Gaza Strip. Palestinians are struggling to flee from areas of Gaza targeted by the Israeli military while grappling with a water and medical supplies shortage. Israel has ordered roughly half of Gaza's population to evacuate their homes and renewed calls on social media and in leaflets dropped from the air for Gaza residents to move south, while Hamas urged people to stay in their homes. The UN and aid groups say such a rapid exodus along with Israel's siege of the 25-mile-long territory would cause untold human suffering. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the evacuation could be tantamount to a death sentence for the more than 2,000 patients in northern hospitals, including newborns in incubators and people in intensive care. Gaza's hospitals are expected to run out of fuel for emergency generations within two days, according to the UN, which said that that would endanger the lives of thousands of patients. A planeload of WHO supplies has landed at Egypt's el-Arish airport and is destined for Gaza when humanitarian access across the border is possible, the United Nations said on Saturday.

At his farm in northeastern Nigeria, he can no longer afford enough fertilizer, so his corn is stunted and pale, the scraggly plants bending toward the powdery earth. Inside his mud house, he has grown accustomed to explaining to his two young children and pregnant wife why they must make do with two meals a day -- and sometimes only one -- even as hunger gnaws. As he and his neighbors commiserate over the calamity unfolding across much of Africa, they exchange theories on one source of trouble: Russia's war on Ukraine, which disrupted shipments of key ingredients for fertilizer. We are in two different worlds, separated by airplanes and oceans, Mr. Chubado said. How can it be affecting us here? That question is reverberating in many lower-income countries. Farmers are grappling with shocks that made fertilizer scarce and unaffordable, diminishing harvests, raising food prices and spreading hunger. The war in Ukraine reduced the region's grain exports and sent the price of staples like wheat soaring from Egypt to Indonesia. The world's food supply is also menaced by the ravages of climate change -- heat waves, drought, floods. Now, scarce and expensive fertilizer is combining with these other forces to threaten livelihoods. The breakdown in fertilizer production challenges the orthodoxy that has dominated international trade for decades. Prominent economists have promoted globalization as insurance against upheaval. When factories in one place cannot produce goods, they can be summoned from somewhere else. Yet as farmers across Africa and parts of Asia contend with fertilizer shortages, their anguish attests to a less celebrated aspect of the interlinked economy: Shared dependence on vital products from dominant suppliers yields widespread danger when shocks emerge. The crisis started with the Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the cost of transporting fertilizer ingredients. Then came the war. Finally, over the last 18 months, the YOU.S. Federal Reserve aggressively lifted interest rates to choke off domestic inflation. That has lifted the value of the American dollar against many currencies. Because fertilizer components are priced in dollars, they have become vastly more expensive in countries like Nigeria. Since February 2022, the price of fertilizer has more than doubled in Nigeria and 13 other countries, according to a survey by ActionAid, an international relief group. Concern about food insecurity has been alarmingly high in much of West and Central Africa, according to a World Bank bulletin. In Nigeria alone, Africa's most populous country, nearly 90 million people -- roughly two-fifths of the nation -- suffer from insufficient food consumption, according to data from the World Food Program. In conversations with three dozen people engaged in growing crops, trading food and distributing fertilizer in northeastern Nigeria, a sense of bewilderment is palpable alongside desperation. Farmers are shifting from growing staples like rice and corn to less valuable crops like soybeans and peanuts, which require less fertilizer. Thieves are stealing harvests. Wives are leaving husbands and returning to families with greater access to food. Parents are pulling children out of school for a lack of tuition money. Upward mobility has yielded to the imperative to hang on. Mr. Chubado, 27, is eager to send his children to university. He typically uses some of his crop to feed his family while selling the rest to raise cash. Yet with no extra crop to sell this year, he recently moved his 10-year-old son, Abubakar, from a private school where classes are no larger than 20 to a government school where 70 children crowd into classrooms. He cannot afford to buy the usual three school uniforms, so Abubakar must make do with one. Some days, his son complains that his uniform is too dirty and refuses to go to school. The Pandemic Shock Faced with extraordinary prices for inorganic or commercial fertilizers, some farmers are shifting to organic varieties, including animal manure. Longer term, that is better for soil, food quality and public health, experts say. But it can take years for crops grown with organic fertilizers to approach the yields achieved through the use of commercial varieties. In Nigeria, home to more than 220 million people, the highest priority is the immediate pursuit of additional food. At least for now, inorganic fertilizers remain a crucial means of adding vital nutrients like nitrogen and potassium to soils. Inorganic fertilizer is a global enterprise, one dominated by producers in the United States, China, India, Russia, Canada and Morocco. Nigeria has several fertilizer factories that produce varieties of nitrogen fertilizer, but they export nearly everything to South America. As a result, the country is vulnerable to any break in the global supply chain. The pandemic delivered a colossal blow. When making and blending fertilizer, Nigeria imports phosphates mined in Morocco, shipping them to the port of Lagos. Over the first two months of the pandemic, as commercial activity froze, shipping companies reduced their ports of call in sub-Saharan Africa by roughly one-fifth, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Then, as regular shipping schedules resumed, Lagos was overwhelmed by a cargo backlog. Seeking easier passage, fertilizer manufacturers diverted shipments to Port Harcourt, about 370 miles down the coast. But rampant piracy in the area entailed higher costs for insurance and freight. In March 2021, a massive container ship ran aground in the Suez Canal, closing that artery of trade and sending global shipping prices skyward. The cost of phosphates from Morocco delivered to Nigeria grew to more than 1,000 per ton, from 300 to 400. You had all those problems compounding supply, said Gideon Negedu, executive secretary of the Fertilizer Producers and Suppliers Association of Nigeria. Then, just as supply was recovering, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Consequences of Conflict For fertilizer producers, the most immediate effect of the war was its impact on energy prices. Nitrogen fertilizers are made through a chemical process that consumes energy, typically natural gas. As the United States, Europe and other governments enforced sanctions against Russia -- a major gas producer -- the price rose. The war also limited access to potash, an important source of potassium. Mining potash is a major industry in Belarus, a Russian ally. Even before the war in Ukraine, Belarus confronted international restrictions on its sales. Russia is another major supplier. American and European sanctions on Russia and Belarus include exemptions intended to allow trade in agricultural commodities. But much of the potash coming out of Belarus -- a landlocked country -- has traditionally been shipped from Lithuania, which has barred rail access since last year. Fertilizer manufacturers could not simply forgo phosphates and make products with the other key nutrients, nitrogen and potassium. Many crops require all three. Mr. Negedu's trade association represents 80 fertilizer blending plants and 500 large distributors around Nigeria. In pursuit of potash, the association pivoted to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, contending with stiff competition from much larger consumers of fertilizer from the United States and India, along with higher shipping rates. For much of last year, a ton of phosphates moved from Canada to Nigeria ran 1,350 -- a roughly fivefold increase over the price before 2020. Scarce Fertilizer In the dusty city of Gombe, Kasim Abubakar, 28, a fertilizer merchant, contemplated his diminishing stocks with a deepening sense of dread. It was July 2022, five months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of the peak season for farmers applying fertilizer. He placed an order for 700 bags of urea -- a form of nitrogen -- with a Nigerian manufacturer. Not until October, four months after the peak season, did he finally receive his shipment. This year, Mr. Abubakar ordered 2,100 bags of NPK, a mixture of the three primary nutrients, from an agribusiness supplier in Lagos. He prepaid the full balance -- 48 million naira, or about 61,000. Several weeks later, a sales manager informed him that production had been halted at the factory. Mr. Abubakar never received his shipment, while waiting four months for a refund. With limited inventory, his sales have dropped by half. In the Gombe area, a shortage of fertilizer worsened. For farmers with enough cash or credit to buy fertilizer, like Mohammed Sambo, 77, this was an opportunity. His 370-acre farm beyond Gombe is home to his four wives, seven children and 40 grandchildren. They live in mud houses that lack electricity and plumbing. Last year, with fertilizer prices climbing, Mr. Sambo and his family cultivated only 74 acres. This year, fertilizer was even more expensive. Still, they nearly doubled their planting and increased their use of fertilizer, divining that -- with other farmers retreating -- the white beans, corn and millet they grew would command a premium. They borrowed the money from a local seed company that provides technical advice along with fertilizer through a program forged by Mercy Corps, the international aid organization. The seed company waits for harvest until it collects its repayment. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Sambo's family proudly displayed its towering corn plants. One of his sons pulled back the silk on a promising ear to reveal plump white kernels. The family plans to fold its profits into expanding its acreage next year, eventually installing solar cells to generate electricity. But those who cannot afford fertilizer are triply cursed. They lack adequate crops to feed their families. They have nothing to sell to raise cash. Yet they must buy food at wildly inflated prices. Adamu Ibrahim, 28, a father of four, had hoped to sell some of his corn to generate funds to advance a crucial project -- replacing the crumbling mud walls of his home. Poisonous snakes regularly slither through the holes, menacing his family. He has been adding sections of cinder block to bar their path. But this year, he could afford to apply only half the usual fertilizer. On a recent afternoon, his corn slumped under the tropical sun. From the look of things, he said, my crop is only going to be for consumption. Impossible Prices By the time the cultivation season began in May, the ingredients for fertilizer were again widely available around the globe. The fertilizer market has stabilized, Mximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, said by telephone from his office in Rome. I do not see that much of a problem at this point. But farmers in much of Africa were still consumed with problems. The price of everything was going up. Fertilizer was available, but many farmers could not afford it. The cost of staple foods like corn, rice and beans was multiplying. So was the cost of meat, because livestock is typically fed with the husks of grains. In Washington, the Fed had been raising interest rates. Investors were selling a variety of currencies in riskier nations like Nigeria and buying suddenly more rewarding assets bought and sold in dollars. Over the last year, the Nigerian naira has surrendered nearly half its value against the dollar. The fall in local currencies increases the cost of all imports, including ingredients to make fertilizer. Fertilizer prices were far from the only source of distress for farmers. Catastrophic floods last year wiped out crops in northeastern Nigeria. In Abuja, the capital, the government eliminated subsidies for fuel this year, increasing transportation costs. And the inability to afford fertilizer makes it harder for rural families to overcome such challenges. Last year, Aisha Hassan Jauro, 40, a mother of five in the city of Yola, borrowed 100,000 naira (about 126) from a local bank at a 20 percent rate of interest. She used the money to buy fertilizer, seeds and pesticides while planting corn on her five acres. The floods destroyed her crop, leaving her with neither food nor cash, but still facing monthly loan payments of 17,500 naira (about 22). She and her husband buy spices and grains at a downtown market and sell them at higher prices in their village, earning enough for a single meal per day. They reserve their most nutritious food for the children -- fried dough made from cassava flour -- while the grown-ups subsist on boiled weeds pulled from their courtyard. They took their daughter out of university, where she was studying disaster management. Another daughter cannot begin seventh grade because they lack the 2,500 naira fee (about 3) for a required test. The land beckons as a potential source of recovery. But this year, with fertilizer even more expensive, they planted nothing. The Final Days For farmers accustomed to feeding their families, a trip to the market has become an indignity. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chubado arrived at the central market in Yola to supplement his meager harvest. He entered a labyrinth of muddy lanes choked with merchants. Boys wheeled wooden carts bearing eggs past women carrying baskets of plantains on their heads. Men stood over wooden tables, wielding knives to hack goats into fresh cuts of meat. The air was thick with the pungent smell of smoked fish, animal innards and diesel fuel, which powered clattering machines grinding corn into flour. Mr. Chubado bought spinach, a purple onion and a bottle of peanut oil for cooking. The oil was double the price of a year earlier, so he bought half his usual amount. He entered a stall where a man used a metal bowl to scoop urea from a large sack into two plastic shopping bags. I used to be able to buy a whole bag, Mr. Chubado said sheepishly. In Gombe, Juliana Bala has become acquainted with a sensation previously unknown in her 70 years -- fear of hunger. She raised six children in a house provided by her husband's employer, a local railroad. Neighbors traditionally shared meals with one another. But on a recent morning, Ms. Bala endured the hourlong trek to her farm, down a muddy, rutted trail, and was horrified to see that her crop had been defiled. Thieves had stolen half her corn. I broke down and cried, she said. How can someone apply their hard work and energy and then they take your harvest? Nearly half her annual income was gone, threatening not only her ability to feed herself, her husband and the six grandchildren they are raising, but depriving them of the savings they needed to buy seeds and fertilizer the next year. They no longer eat meat or fish, subsisting on porridge made from yam and beans. Crop theft was a new affliction. Ms. Bala took it as a sign -- that there were enough hungry people to stray into criminality; that the warnings she had absorbed from her Lutheran preacher were coming to pass. The final days were approaching, this the preacher had intoned for years. The pandemic was the first sign. The shortages of fertilizer and food -- spurred by a war -- seemed like the next one. And now, with half her crop disappeared, she could no longer feed the children. Life has changed, Ms. Bala said.

This will also be the first time since the 2008 invasion of Gaza that Israel has attempted to capture and retain territory. Israel has subjected Gaza to the heaviest bombardment in its history. New Delhi: The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) geared up for a ground attack on the Hamas-held Gaza Strip today, in retaliation for the unprecedented land-sea-air assault on its territories that left over 1,300 Israelis dead. As Israel continued its airstrike on Hamas-linked locations in Gaza, Iran warned of grave consequences if the bombardment did not stop. Israel is poised for its most ambitious ground offensive since the 2006 invasion of Lebanon. This will also be the first time since the 2008 invasion of Gaza that Israel has attempted to capture and retain territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to eliminate Hamas after its deadly attack on civilians, the deadliest in the country's history. Israel has subjected Gaza to the heaviest bombardment in its history. This placed the region, home to 2.3 million people, under a complete lockdown and destroyed much of its infrastructure. To counter Hamas's multi-pronged attack, Israel, along with the combined might of its military and air force, has mobilised 300,000 reservists to fulfill Netanyahu's avowed quest to reduce Gaza to rubble. The planned ground offensive had not begun by the early hours of Sunday. But Why The Delay? According to The New York Times, the Israeli forces' weekend invasion plans were thwarted by cloudy weather, which would have made it difficult for pilots and drone operators to provide air cover for ground troops. Thousands of Gazans flooded into southern Gaza on Saturday after Israel warned them to leave before the possible ground assault. UN officials in Gaza said the Israeli military, which is massing troops at the border, had given them a 24-hour deadline to complete the evacuation. The Israeli army carried out localised raids in Gaza over the past 24 hours to clear the area of terrorists and weapons, and to locate missing persons. A potential full-scale invasion is complex, compounded by the fact that Hamas is believed to be holding many Israeli hostages in their underground bunkers and tunnels.

Experts caution that Israel will lose its firepower superiority and be forced to engage the enemy in close combat if a ground offensive is launched. gaza, the densely populated area with its intricate network of tunnels is a key factor in israel's daunting security situation. An Israeli military spokesperson stated recently that they are attacking portions of the tunnel network, but it will be a grueling battle. Israeli military analysts say they fear that Hamas will use the hostages as human shields, creating a moral and operational dilemma for Israel. There are also concerns that Hamas will use the Israeli hostages as human shields to deter an offensive by creating a massive operational dilemma for Israeli authorities. Yesterday. the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a dire warning, stating that evacuating thousands of hospital patients to already overflowing hospitals in southern Gaza could be catastrophic and lead to a significant loss of life. The WHO emphasised that the healthcare system in Gaza is already on the verge of collapse and that the additional influx of patients could overwhelm it completely. The organisation also cautioned that the evacuation process itself could be dangerous for patients, many of whom are in critical condition after relentless Israeli airstrikes in the region. A New War Front? Israel also faces the possibility of a separate war in the other side of the country in its northern border with Lebanon after artillery fire exchange with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. Hezbollah's second-in-command Naim Qassem said the group was fully prepared to join its Palestinian ally Hamas in the war against Israel.

Iran told Israel via the United Nations it would intervene if operations in Gaza continued, a report claimed, as Israel readied a 'wide range of offensive operational plans' including a 'joint and coordinated attack on Gaza from the air, sea and land.' Diplomatic sources told Axios that while Iran did not want the conflict to escalate, it was prepared to intervene either directly or indirectly, such as via a military group in Syria or Lebanon. Schools in Lebanon remain closed amid fears of Israeli missiles targeting Hezbollah militants near the border. While Hezbollah has not formally joined the war, the group has clashed with Israeli forces several times this week. Reports broke around 1am BST on Sunday that the group had struck Israeli border fences with anti-tank missiles, hours after Israel told Hezbollah to stay out of the conflict with Hamas, warning that intervening could lead to Lebanon's 'destruction'. Israeli strikes also targeted the airport of Syria's government-held city of Aleppo injuring five people on Saturday, a war monitor said, days after a similar strike hit Aleppo and Damascus airports. Syria's defence ministry also confirmed the strikes, writing 'the Israeli enemy carried out an air strike from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea... targeting Aleppo International Airport, causing material damage to the airport and putting it out of service.' As tensions flare, the United States announced that it would be sending a second aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean. The Eisenhower will join the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group, which is already sailing near Israel, to bolster YOU.S. presence there with a host of destroyers, fighter aircraft and cruisers.

Hezbollah and other Palestinian factions in Lebanon have exchanged cross-border fire with Israel since Hamas's surprise October 7 attack from Gaza ignited a war that has killed more than 1,300 people in Israel. Palestinian gunmen also seized an estimated 150 hostages while Israel's retaliatory air and artillery bombardment has killed more than 2,200 people in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. A Hezbollah statement said the fighter was 'martyred while performing jihad'. A spokesperson told AFP he was killed in south Lebanon 'either in Israeli strikes or in clashes'. Two Lebanese civilians were also killed in Israeli shelling of the southern village of Shebaa, its mayor Mohammad Saab told AFP. Earlier Saturday Hezbollah and Israel said they had exchanged cross-border fire, with the Israeli army saying they had killed several 'terrorists' trying to slip across. Hezbollah said it had fired guided missiles and mortar rounds at Israeli positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms section of the border with Israel and the annexed Golan Heights. The Israeli military said it retaliated by 'striking the origin of the launches'. France on Saturday urged the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia to stay out of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, expressing concern at the situation on the Lebanon-Israel border. Paris also called for reporters covering the Israel-Hamas war to be protected after one journalist was killed and six others wounded in firing along the Lebanese border on Friday. Hezbollah and Lebanon must 'exercise restraint to avoid opening a second front in the region', of which 'the first victim will be Lebanon', the French presidency said in a statement Saturday.

Israeli army spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said on Saturday that Israeli forces are now 'in formation... all around the Gaza Strip, in the south, in the centre and the north' as Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu met with troops. Netanyahu's office said in a statement, and an accompanying video showed him telling them: 'You ready for the next stage? The next stage is coming.' Rights groups around the world have urged Israel to relent, warning of an impending humanitarian crisis after it gave an order to evacuate some 1.1mn people living in the north of Gaza on Friday. Israel was accused of breaking international law over the sudden order to leave, with aid agencies warning such an unprecedented evacuation was impossible. The United Nations urged Israel to withdraw the demand and said it would have 'devastating humanitarian consequences'. Amnesty International wrote: 'The initial announcement gave people 24 hours to leave northern Gaza for their safety and protection - an impossible demand that even the Israeli army spokesperson has admitted cannot be implemented in one day. 'Regardless of timeframe, Israel cannot treat northern Gaza as an open-fire zone based on having issued this order. Their forces have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians wherever they are in Gaza.' The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received an Israeli order to evacuate the hospital by 4:00 p.m., but would not do so because it had a humanitarian duty to keep providing services to the sick and wounded. Gaza has been under siege since October 9, restricting access to essential supplies of food, water, electricity, fuel and medicine supplies. Hospitals are struggling to keep the power on as beds fill up with wounded men, women and children caught up in Israeli shelling. Thousands were pictured travelling south along two designated 'safe routes', reportedly hit by explosions on both Friday and Saturday. The Israeli military's evacuation would force the territory's entire population to cram into the southern half of the Gaza Strip as Israel continues strikes across the territory, including in the south.

The Federal Railroad Administration did not respond directly to the criticism of the rule requiring cameras showing both the train crew's actions and a view from the front of passenger trains. FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said freight railroads were not addressed because a 2015 law Congress passed only required regulators to establish a rule for passenger railroads. But many freight railroads, including all the biggest ones that handle a majority of shipments nationwide, have installed cameras voluntarily, starting with outward-facing cameras and later adding ones showing the crews' actions. The cameras are less common on smaller railroads. A spokeswoman for the American Short Line and Railroad Association said only a few short-line railroads have them and most of those are only outward-facing cameras. The Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February did have cameras, but Ms. Homendy said that because there are no federal standards for those cameras, investigators have only 20 minutes of footage from before that derailment. Though many in the freight rail industry have opted to install recorders voluntarily, there is absolutely no standard for the number of hours of data they must preserve after an accident, Ms. Homendy said. East Palestine is a striking example: instead of having 12 hours' worth of in cab video, as we have recommended, our investigators only have access to a 20-minute recording -- not nearly enough to help us or the FRA identify critical safety improvements needed to prevent similar accidents from reoccurring. Ms. Homendy said the new rule also fails to require audio recordings inside the cabs of locomotives. Investigators determined that the Metrolink engineer was sending and receiving text messages on his cell phone before the crash, and he ran a red signal light before slamming into the Union Pacific freight train. Congress responded to that Chatsworth collision by requiring railroads to develop and install an automatic braking system that might have prevented it -- something that took more than a decade and roughly 15 billion to complete. And regulators banned cell phone use by train operators. Later, lawmakers also required regulators in the 2015 law to look at requiring locomotive video recorders for passenger trains. Amtrak pledged in 2015 to install cameras on its trains after a crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured about 200. This new rule will require cameras on all intercity commuter and passenger trains as well. While video recorders cannot directly prevent accidents, they help maintain a higher standard of safety, said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. In addition, these devices play a vital role in post-accident investigations, providing valuable evidence that helps us understand the circumstances leading to the accident and take appropriate action to prevent similar accidents in the future.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Passenger railroads nationwide will now be required to install video recorders inside their locomotives.

Using satellite images, scientists at the British Antarctic Survey were able to see that sea ice in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea region last year broke up long before the start of the birds' fledgling period, when penguin chicks would have developed their waterproof feathers. The research, published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth  Environment, found that more than 90 of emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica could be quasi-extinct by the end of the century if global warming continues at its current pace. We have never seen emperor penguins fail to breed, at this scale, in a single season, Peter Fretwell, a geographic information scientist at the British Antarctic Survey and the study's lead author, said in a statement. The loss of sea ice in this region during the Antarctic summer made it very unlikely that displaced chicks would survive. The findings offer a grim outlook for emperor penguins and their habitats if global warming continues unchecked. The research is also of particular concern because Antarctic sea ice this year has plunged to record lows, far below extents that would be considered typical for this time of year in the Southern Hemisphere. Emperor penguins tend to return year after year to the same breeding sites, and typically lay their eggs from May to June during winter in Antarctica. Eggs will hatch after 65 days, but it takes until December and January -- summer months in the Southern Hemisphere -- before chicks grow their waterproof feathers and are able to leave the colonies to find food. In late 2022, Antarctic sea ice extent tied an all-time low that was set the previous year, said Caroline Holmes, a polar climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey who was not involved with the penguin study but has used its findings to better understand longer-term trends and anomalies across the southernmost continent. We saw a very early break-up of the sea ice and an early melt, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea region, where we have a lot of the penguin colonies, she said. Satellite imagery taken last November showed a total loss of sea ice in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea regions. As a result, Fretwell and his colleagues think, there is a high probability that no penguin chicks survived from four out of the five colonies in that area. In the study, the scientists wrote that some chicks may have survived on grounded icebergs but added that it is impossible to make those estimates based only on satellite images. If the current pace of global warming continues, more than 90 of emperor penguin colonies will be quasi-extinct by the year 2100, the researchers found. Quasi-extinction does not mean all emperor penguins will disappear, but rather that the species cannot reproduce adequately to grow the population, and thus may be doomed to extinction even if some birds are still alive. We know that emperor penguins are highly vulnerable in a warming climate -- and current scientific evidence suggests that extreme sea ice loss events like this will become more frequent and widespread, Fretwell said in a statement. Holmes said last year's declines in Antarctic sea ice fit within a broader pattern that has been observed during almost a decade, with the past two years logging the lowest sea ice extents in 45 years of satellite records. Particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea, what we saw in November and December 2022 was really unprecedented, in terms of how little sea ice was there and how early that sea ice broke up, she added. While myriad atmospheric and ocean conditions contribute to variations in how Antarctic sea ice grows and melts each year, climate models suggest that global warming caused by humans is contributing to long-term declines. But more data is needed to untangle precisely what that means for the stability of Antarctica's continental ice sheets and the health of its ecosystems, Holmes said. Pinpointing those answers is crucial, she added, because sea ice declines this year are even deeper. Sea ice extent as of this month is roughly 850,000 square miles less than the median value from 1981 to 2022. That missing sea ice is equivalent to an area larger than Greenland, according to the British Antarctic Survey. Holmes said the study's findings are yet another alarm bell over the need to limit the impacts of climate change -- particularly a because certain amount of warming has already been baked into the system. Even if we drop our emissions, there is going to be a certain amount of ice melt that will still happen, she said. But, obviously the more we can limit emissions the better.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"All but one of five known breeding sites for emperor penguins in Antarctica experienced a total breeding failure during the 2022 season.

A look at the Iran-backed militant group on the sidelines of the Israel-Hamas war,"Created with the support of Iran, Hezbollah set a mission to expel Israeli forces from Lebanon, while resisting Western influence in the Middle East. TYRE, Lebanon -- As Israel's military prepares for what appears to be an imminent ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, the Hezbollah militant group looms in Lebanon just across Israel's northern border. Hours after Hamas' brazen and bloody attack on October 7, Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery into Israel, which was met with an artillery barrage. Since then the tit-for-tat combat has continued. Early Saturday the Israel Defense Forces said it had struck a Hezbollah target in southern Lebanon in response to the infiltration of unidentified aerial objects into Israel. It came after Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's deputy chief, said Friday that the group is closely following developments between Hamas and Israel. We as Hezbollah contribute to the confrontation, and will contribute to it within our vision and our plan, he said. We follow the moves of the enemy, and we are fully ready. When the time comes for any action, we will carry it out. A Shia resistance movement with ties to Iran Formed in the early 1980s as Lebanon was wracked by a civil war, Hezbollah, sometimes spelled Hizballah or Hezbullah, is a Shia political party and militant organization. The name means Party of God. Created with support from Iran, the group set a mission to expel Israeli forces from Lebanon, while resisting Western influence in the Middle East. The organization brands itself as a Shia resistance movement within Lebanon that believes in the country's right to self-determination, while also pledging its allegiance to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Hezbollah's current leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was a member of the Amal Movement, a Shia militia that was one of the many groups vying for power during the Lebanese civil war, before he joined Hezbollah in 1982. Closely aligned with the Iranian regime, he took over as secretary-general in 1992 after Israel assassinated the group's co-founder and previous leader, Abbas Al-Musawi, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group's militant activity and support from Tehran has led the United States, the United Kingdom and other nations to designate it as a terror organization. But Hezbollah also has lawmakers sitting in the Lebanese parliament and provides numerous social services within the country. However, its popularity appeared to be waning in last year's parliamentary elections: The Hezbollah-led coalition won 61 seats in the 128-member legislature, a decrease of 10 members since the last vote was held four years ago. Fraught relationship with Israel While Lebanon was deeply entrenched in its own sectarian civil war between 1975 to 1990, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel were at odds just south of Lebanon's border. In June 1982, Israel invaded south Lebanon in pursuit of PLO fighters that had made the country a base a decade prior, according to Hezbollah: A Short History by Augustus Norton. Hezbollah rose to prominence as it fought to remove Israel's presence from the country until it eventually withdrew its forces in May 2000. Tensions simmered for the next six years until war broke out again on July 12, 2006, after Hezbollah fighters crossed into Israel and ambushed a group of soldiers, killing three of them and taking two others hostage. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery strikes, before it imposed a naval and air blockade. Israeli forces also launched a ground invasion. Over 1,000 people, the majority civilians, are thought to have died in the conflict, which formally ended after 34 days. Since then there has been low-level fighting as the sides have occasionally exchanged fire across the border. Hezbollah also committed itself to the destruction of Israel in its 2009 manifesto, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Brothers in arms Formed five years after Hezbollah in 1987 during an uprising against Israel's occupation of Gaza, Hamas was originally a faction of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas leaders consider the Lebanese group an ally, and Hezbollah announced its solidarity with Hamas this week following Hamas' multipronged incursion into Israel, which left hundreds dead. Both are backed by Iran. Claiming responsibility for rockets fired out of Lebanon toward Israel, Hezbollah said in a statement Monday that it stood with the victorious Palestinian resistance and the struggling and patient Palestinian people. But aside from these sporadic attacks, it has to date shown restraint -- consistent with the informal rules of engagement that have governed the cross-border conflict for nearly two decades. Stomach for the fight? Lebanon is currently undergoing a crippling economic crisis, driven in part by political mismanagement and an influx of refugees. Hyperinflation has made it nearly impossible for average citizens to afford the high costs of living in recent years, and the European Commission estimates that 80 of Lebanon's citizens are living in poverty. A number of Lebanese politicians criticized Hezbollah for even considering entering into another conflict with Israel. Sami Gemayel, a lawmaker with the Christian-aligned Kataeb Party, said in a statement Wednesday that Hezbollah was forcibly linking the Lebanese people to the conflict. We are not ready to see Lebanon be dragged into this war, he said according to a translation of the statement by Lebanese state media. Firas Maksad, an expert on Lebanese politics at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told NBC News earlier this week that the Lebanese public does not have an appetite for war. Even amongst the Shia community and Hezbollah's support base, there will be great resentment and Hezbollah will be at pains to justify and explain why they got involved in this war, he said. A wider conflict? National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said during a briefing Wednesday that the YOU.S. was clearly concerned about the rockets being fired out of Lebanon.

President Biden, he is been very clear that no one, state or nonstate actor, should try to take advantage of this moment, Blinken said. Were it to enter the conflict, Hezbollah would bring to bear vast supplies of advanced weaponry, advanced training and well-organized ranks of experienced troops who have been bloodied by more than a decade of fighting Sunni Islamist militants in Syria, perhaps dwarfing the capability of even Hamas.

OilPrice.com,"Tensions and increased weapon development hint at Russia's potential decision to withdraw, further eroding international arms control frameworks. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The Treaty on Open Skies. New START. For years, the pillars of international arms control have been crumbling: agreements signed by Washington, Moscow, and others during and after the Cold War aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear war, costly arms races, or overall military tensions. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty may be the next to go. Signed in 1996, the treaty was a major step to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology and keeping a lid on the arsenals of the world's biggest nuclear powers. Along with earlier treaties, the agreement, known as the CTBT, also aimed to reduce the spread of radioactive material that was blasted into the atmosphere and the oceans during the frenzied days of the Cold War. Here is the problem: The treaty never went into effect because a number of countries, including the United States, never ratified it. Still, most signatories -- including Russia and the United States, whose arsenals are by far the biggest in the world -- have abided by the ban. Now, however, Russia is making noises about backing out and de-ratifying the treaty. Here is what you need to know about the CTBT and its potential unraveling: How did It Come About? The United States and the Soviet Union, as well as Britain, conducted hundreds of nuclear tests between 1945, when the world's first atomic bomb was detonated in the YOU.S. state of New Mexico and 1961, when Soviet officials detonated the world's most powerful weapon, the Tsar Bomba. France joined the nuclear testing club in 1960; China, in 1964. The fallout, literal and figurative, from the testing led to a partial ban on atmospheric, oceanic, and space tests in 1963; underground tests continued to be allowed. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear device, further expanding the nuclear club. A 1980 test by China became the last atmospheric test by any country anywhere. Moscow's final test -- underground -- occurred in October 1990 on the remote Arctic archipelago called Novaya Zemlya. Britain, the United States, France, and China all conducted their final tests in the years that followed, prior to 1996, mainly underground. What is It Do? The CTBT basically bans all tests that result in a fission chain reaction, essentially a nuclear explosion. Signed in 1996, the treaty was sent out to 187 signatory countries for ratification, but it has never come into effect because of a group of holdout countries. Russia signed and ratified the treaty in 2000. The United States signed, but the YOU.S. Senate refused to ratify, citing concerns about verifying other countries' compliance with the ban. Despite nonratification, the United States has complied with the moratorium. China signed but did not ratify. Neither India, nor Pakistan, nor North Korea -- all of which have conducted open nuclear tests since 1996 -- is a member. The treaty does allow for states to conduct subcritical, or zero-yield tests. Those involve explosives and nuclear materials but do not result in a fission reaction, the reaction that gives atomic weapons their terrible power. Both the United States and Russia are known to have conducted such tests. Despite not ratifying the treaty, the United States does provide 33 million annually in funding for a system set up to monitor possible nuclear tests, as well as the Vienna-based organization charged with overseeing it. What is The Problem Now? As relations between Washington and Moscow have worsened, major treaties between them have also frayed or collapsed entirely. Washington unilaterally pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty in 2002, angering Moscow. Washington for years accused Moscow of trying to cheat on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty until it effectively collapsed in 2019. In 2021, Russia withdrew from the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows countries to conduct surveillance flights over one another's territories in order to observe weapons and military sites. Both countries have adhered to New START, which capped the number of warheads and delivery vehicles each could possess. New START's extension, by both Russia and the United States in early 2021, was a lone bright spot in the continuing erosion of arms control. But the agreement expires in 2026 and cannot be extended. Unless a successor treaty can be agreed upon and ratified, there will be no limits on the countries' arsenals after that year. Tensions over Ukraine have kept the two sides from even sending inspectors to one another's countries, as stipulated for in New START. Both countries have also moved to modernize and upgrade their arsenals. But in a sign of deepening distrust, the YOU.S. State Department suggested in a 2022 report that Russia had not adhered to the standard of zero-yield testing. So Russia Wants To Pull Out Then? For more than a decade, the Kremlin has increased spending not only on conventional weapons and force strength but also on modernizing and expanding its strategic arsenal. In 2018, Putin boasted that Russia was developing new weapons like an unmanned, nuclear-capable, underwater torpedo, and a hypersonic glide missile. He also bragged of the development of a nuclear-powered cruise missile -- the Burevestnik, which has had major problems. In recent years, researchers have been monitoring a surge of activity on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago: satellite imagery showing an uptick of construction at one or possibly two settlements that researchers had identified as sites for a possible test of a nuclear device or the trouble-plagued Burevestnik. A top Russian nuclear researcher called for Russia to resume testing, and on October 5 Putin announced a successful test of the Burevestnik, though he provided no details. Putin also opened to the door to Russia resuming nuclear testing, saying it could de-ratify the CTBT. A week later, on October 12, the speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, introduced legislation to withdraw ratification. The prospect of Russia withdrawing prompted alarm bells, including from the CTBTO, the Vienna-based organization charged with monitoring compliance. What Happens Next? Even if de-ratification ends up happening, as is likely in the Kremlin-controlled parliament, that does not necessarily mean Russia will start blowing up uranium or plutonium again, on Novaya Zemlya or otherwise. I think that withdrawal of ratification is a strictly political step -- leveling status with the YOU.S., said Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian Foreign Ministry official and arms control expert. I think the main motive is the perception that 'Russia tried too hard in the past and made too many concessions' and now 'We are not interested in arms control more than other countries.' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Duma's foreign affairs committee, emphasized that Russia would not be withdrawing its signature under the treaty or withdrawing from the voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. We are withdrawing the ratification, thus restoring legislative parity with the YOU.S. Congress, he told the newspaper Kommersant. It was especially important for the CTBTO to hear that revoking ratification does not mean that Russia intends to resume nuclear tests and implies that Russia will continue to fully participate in the work being done for the Treaty's entry into force, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's ambassador in Vienna, told the state news agency RIA Novosti. Still, it is not a good sign, experts say -- all the more so, given the demise of other treaties. Russia or any major nuclear power backing out of the CTBT would be a huge blow to the global nonproliferation regime and would undoubtedly lead to a cascade of nuke testing by other states, Lynn Rusten, a former YOU.S. arms control negotiator, told RFERL. There could also be other nonproliferation or arms control treaties that are at risk, since, according to Sokov, the Kremlin has initiated a review of all similar agreements. One strong candidate for de-ratification or a downgrading of Russia's involvement, he said, is the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention, which obligates members to destroy their stocks of chemical weapons. Russia's compliance with that treaty has been in question since the near-fatal poisonings of former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal in England in 2018 and opposition activist Aleksei Navalny in Siberia in 2020. In both cases, Western scientists identified a powerful Soviet-era nerve agent and suggested that Russia had maintained a secret, undeclared chemical weapons program.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Tensions and increased weapon development hint at Russia's potential decision to withdraw.

Benjamin Okezie Kalu says the South East geo-political zone losses over N13 billion due to disruption in the movement of goods between the north and the southern part of the country. This is as the Deputy Speaker unveiled the mechanism as Peace In The South East (PISE) project aimed at restoring normalcy in the zone. Relying on available statistics, Kalu said that the south East looses an estimated N10 billion to N13 billion in the transportation sector alone on every sit-at-home day. The Deputy Speaker made the submissions during a courtesy call on him by the Nigerian Association Of Small And Medium Enterprises (NASMEs) led by its President, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima in his office on Friday in Abuja. Kalu said that insecurity in the region was affecting the small and medium enterprises which he recognized as a major contributor to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He however assured the commitment of the House to review the laws that are inhibiting the operations of the SMEs in the country. He said: According to recent data, SMEs account for 48 of the National GDP in emerging economies, additionally the World Bank report SMEs play pivotal role in job creation. Therefore, up scaling entrepreneurship because its strategic imperative to revitalizing the Nigerian economy. SMEs must be seen as a strategic tool to our economic development. As legislators, we are aware of security problems facing our nation. In recent years, the security situation has posed hurdles. The sit -at-home in the South East has affected the movement of goods between the north and the south. It ought not to be so. Why this issue affects the entire nation. We can examine specific examples. Our businesses are going down and most of our businesses are SME businesses and the security challenges are suffocating the SMEs businesses in their numbers. Also billions and trillions of Naira are being lost to the sit at home order. There are other parts of the country where insecurity has suffocated SMEs and something must be done about this. It is disheartening to note that the ongoing insecurity in the region will have a profound impact to trade and socioeconomic outcomes. Statistics from SBM Intelligence revealed that the south East looses an estimated ten billion naira to 13 billion in the transportation sector alone, every sit at home day. Traders on the other hand face looses ranging from N5.4 billion to N31 billion daily. These figures are alarming and underscore the urgency of addressing the security challenges in the region. So if there is no reason for these non state actors to stop this, let this be their reason. That they are killing their own region with insecurities created by themselves. When you sit at home other regions are not sitting at home. When the SMEs in the south east suffer due to insecurity, the country suffers. It impacts the whole country. There must be legislative commitment in order to address some of your concerns. The SMEs are the backbone of every country. As legislators, we are committed to supporting and making laws to grow SMEs. My office is ready to partner with the association, we will find ways to review existing laws that will be not SMEs friendly. We believe that by creating more enabling environment for SMEs to thrive, we can address some of the economic challenges facing our great nation. Earlier in his presentation, the President of the Nigerian Association Of Small And Medium Enterprises (NASME) led by its President, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima appealed to the Deputy Speaker to help the body enact laws that will support the growth of SMEs in the country. On unveiling the PISE project, he said that that soon his office in agreement with all the lawmakers from the region irrespective of the political parties will reach out the State governors and other critical stakeholders for the launch and implementation of the project. He also said that the project will feature a regional security integration and political leadership that will streamline an agenda for the promotion of Igbo because and growth in terms of infrastructure. Kalu who made the revelations during a courtesy call on him by the national leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex socio-cultural group led by its President General, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu bemoaned the insecurity in the south east. He added that the sit-at-home observed in the region every Monday has crippled businesses and left the region empty. Kalu who vehemently objected to the sit-at-home order stated that Ndigbo must extend their handshakes across the federation to restore confidence. The Deputy Speaker also commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his benevolence to Ndigbo by ensuring that the people of the south east were accorded a place in the political hierarchy of the country. Kalu also remarked of his cordial relationship with the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, saying he will be delighted in accommodating the requests of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in stamping out insecurity in the south east. He said: Let me also state that, in our pursuit for these noble objectives, it is imperative that we draw a clear distinction between a legitimate call for justice, equity and fairness against criminal activities. There is a difference between the two of them. Criminal activities cannot be taken to mean legitimate call. Secession is not a legitimate call. We want to remain as one Nigeria! It is a distinction that our people must be able to make. And together we must ensure that the line is firmly drawn. Igbo Community has always been in the forefront of nation building and positive change. Go to any part of Nigeria, if you do not see an Igbo man there, it means that place is not progressing, it means that place is not prosperous. We are everywhere, nobody is as patriotic as the Igbo man. I am here today, not just as the representative of the people of Bende, but as a representative of all Nigerians. The House of Representatives is actually named the House of the People for a reason. The 10th House of Representatives led by my Principal, Rt. Hon. Tajudeen Abbas, who is currently in India and who has sent his greetings and who would love to host you when he is back, as we arrange your next visit, the Honourable Speaker himself will be here. And I want to say that I have a good working relationship with the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I want to report to you as the father of Igbo land that, I have a good relationship between me and this North Westerner, who is the Speaker. He does not discriminate, he does not undermine me, he sees the potentials and we are working together like twins to help Nigeria in the House of Representatives. With him, we will ensure that there is justice, with him, we will ensure that there is fairness, with him, we will ensure that there is equity to all, including the Igbos. We are not known for self destruction that is evident in the idea of sit-at-home or unknown gun men. It is not our thing. It is alien to us. We do not kill one another. We love our trade, we love our farms. We do not sit at home. Sitting at home is for lazy people. Igbo people are not lazy people. Those in support of sit-at-home are not Igbos. There is no true son of the soil of Igbo land that would support laziness and call it a strategy for secession. If you sit at home, you are a lazy man. Igbos are not known to be lazy. We are industrious, we are entrepreneurs, we work hard to succeed. The tradition of collective action and communalism has been a hallmark of the Igbo people throughout history, from building schools and hospitals to markets and farms. We are not known for self-destruction that is evident in the idea of sit-at-home or unknown gunmen. These tendencies are alien and abhorrent to how the Igbos are constituted; socially, culturally, and economically. In addressing our present challenges, we have the opportunity to draw on the things that pull us together. We may have different political platforms, but we must realize that the commonwealth and common good are ultimately the same. Onye aghana nwanne ya, he said. Earlier in his presentation, the President-General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu called for the release of the leader of defunct Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, saying it will help restore peace in the South East. Ohaneze has decided that we want Nnamdi Kanu released. We think that every effort should be made to release Nnamdi Kanu. If he is released, it is going to make it easy for us, he said.

The White House on Friday accused North Korea of shipping weapons to Russia, near the Ukraine border. Its claims are based on an image released Friday showing a shipment from an ammunition depot in North Korea, or DPRK, that was loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by rail to a depot along Russia's southwestern border. The delivery took place between Sept. 7 and October 1, the YOU.S. says. 'We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilian and further Russia's illegitimate war,' National Security Council Director of Strategic Communications John Kirby said Friday. This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows increased activity at the Tumangang Rail Facility in North Korea on October 5, 2023. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) Kirby has disclosed that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions. He said that the YOU.S. believes Kim Jong Un is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions - to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime, Kirby warned. He noted that Washington is in lockstep with allies and partners to counter arms deals between Russia and North Korea by sanctioning individuals and entities working to facilitate such arms deals. We will not allow the DPRK to aid Russia's war machine in secret, and the world should know about the support that Russia may again provide the DPRK in return, Kirby said. North Korea on Friday lambasted the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it an undisguised military provocation and proof that the YOU.S. plans an attack against it. North Korea threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. Targeting Odesa Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, during a visit to the Black Sea port of Odesa, pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defenses and to increase the security of a 'humanitarian corridor' for grain exports. Zelenskyy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black Sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are a vital source of revenue for Ukraine's defense spending following Russia's invasion last year.

(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) 'We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole,' Zelenskyy said. The Odesa region has become a frequent target of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed upwards of 300,000 tons of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels already had been loaded with grain for exports and used a new 'humanitarian' grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian airstrikes during the winter, Rutte said Friday. 'This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So, the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric airstrikes,' Rutte said in Odesa. Rutte also said the Netherlands would help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Funding the effort European Union leaders meeting later in October will demand 'decisive progress' on using Russian assets frozen by sanctions to help Ukraine, according to their draft statement, addressing a matter that has been stuck for months. The United States and Britain last month showed support for an EU plan to tax windfall profits generated by frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine as Kyiv battles a full-scale Russian invasion begun in February 2022. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven, or G7, industrialized countries meeting in Morocco on Thursday estimated 280 billion worth of such assets had been frozen. They said they expected more work in the coming months to find legally sound ways of using them to aid Ukraine. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak joins other political leaders to view military equipment that has been given to Ukraine before they attend the Joint Expeditionary Summit on the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden. (Stefan RousseauPool via Reuters) Belgium, not a member of the G7 group, where most frozen Russian central bank assets are held, said it expects to collect 2.4 billion in taxes on the assets and use them to help Ukraine's reconstruction process, a spokesperson for Belgium's prime minister said Wednesday. Britain is planning to increase its military presence in northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, or JEF, defense cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. JEF, a defense cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to 'outside activity,' stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. 'This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent,' Sunak said in a statement.

The global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment. The emergency has grounded flights and sparked lawsuits, amid claims that a one-time DJ based in the South of England is at the centre of a ploy to pass off old parts with doctored papers. The fake parts scandal began in August when a document was circulated by European aviation regulators asking airline companies and their suppliers to investigate errant engine parts. Two months later and the true scale of the problem is emerging: TUI, Virgin Australia and nearly every major US carrier have been caught up in the crisis, which has forced the grounding of jets and delayed flights as operators try to weed out bogus components of unknown origin. Two Virgin Australia aircraft were withdrawn from use in September and earlier this month US giant Delta said a small number of its engines would need overhauling. TUI said it found one part it had then removed. The company said to be at the centre of the scandal is British-headquartered AOG Technics, founded and owned by 35-year-old Jose Zamora Yrala. Zamora has been accused by US engine giant General Electric and its French business partner Safran of large-scale fraud that they allege has led to fake or old parts being falsely installed into more than a hundred engines. His company is accused of falsifying the records that come with aviation components to show they are the real deal. CFM, a joint venture between GE and Safran that manufacturers engines, is now pursuing a legal case against AOG in Britain's High Court. Zamora is defending the case. Verification documents are important because of the exacting specifications of airline parts. Engine modules must tolerate temperatures that would melt many materials and even basic parts must be certified. Because of these demands, even a bolt can cost thousands of pounds if it is holding an engine in place. As a result, the market for airline parts is a very lucrative one. Since 2015, Zamora has charmed his way deep into the complex network of companies and decision makers who move billions of pounds worth of airline parts around the world. Business associates who worked with him outside AOG and who were willing to speak to The Telegraph describe a savvy operator who was fun to be around. Zamora, who is Venezuelan, got his start in aviation in 2010 as an account manager at AJW, an engine maintenance business, according to Bloomberg. A keen techno DJ, he was also gigging as recently as 2018 according to the Daily Mail. Zamora founded AOG in 2015 from a rented terraced house in Hove on the South Coast. It appeared to be small scale in its early years: the company's registered address moved between four homes in the following three years, shifting from Hove to London in 2017. Then, the company was registered at serviced offices in central London. Friends say they have not been in contact with Zamora in a number of months as he begins his defence in London's High Court. AOG's website appears offline but a cached versions says the company offered a diverse portfolio of quality products and services. With our head office in the UK and warehouse operations in London, Frankfurt, Miami and Singapore, we are uniquely positioned to support our customers around the world - 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the website read. We keep our clients flying. The company's phone line is still connected but offers only endless hold music. AOG is understood to have sold mainly smaller parts for jet engines, such as bolts, nuts, washers, dampers and seals. The parts do not carry a serial number and are therefore harder to trace. Worryingly, some bigger parts appear to be linked to the scandal. Some turbine blades have also been identified by CFM as suspect. CFM is understood to believe that AOG had been passing off old parts for new ones. Steve Borrowdale, managing director at Multiflight, a Leeds-based engineer and parts supplier, says sneaking parts into a jet engine is difficult. After vetting a seller for experience and approval certification, a buyer would also carefully inspect a part from a new supplier. You get the box, you would have a look, just for simple things. If there is a brand-new part coming in a non-identified box, you might start to question it. Choosing parts without serial numbers could make falsifying documents easier, he said, but it would still take great skill. You could not just take a novice off the street and start selling these things, you would have to have gotten some training somewhere along the way. According to filings at Companies House, AOG grew slowly from 2015 until 2019, when the company had net assets of 22,000. By early 2020, it was worth 2.2m. A breakthrough came when it won a deal with logistics firm BH Worldwide to distribute parts from its hub in Frankfurt. The two companies have previously worked together for exports to Europe and the USA from the UK but this is the first time they have partnered in mainland Europe, the pair said in a press release in 2020. AOG's cash bonanza came before the Covid lockdowns of that year, according to the filings. The pandemic grounded flights and was a disaster for the aviation industry. However, the end of lockdowns triggered a resurgence in international travel and a rush to secure jets and parts amid backlogs in factories. The parts scramble that followed would be a perfect breeding ground for an unscrupulous seller, said Borrowdale. Since Covid, raw materials are increasingly difficult to get hold off, he said. The supply of parts in aviation is through a dazzling patchwork of thousands of often small manufacturers, brokers and distributors. Manufacturers and operators are heavily regulated and largely responsible for orchestrating the paper trail that follows every aviation part, from computers and fuselage panels to screw housings and washers. CFM has had to audit more than 500 suppliers to try and find out what items could be caught up in the crisis. The parts so far identified in the forgery scandal are not thought to include the most sensitive components, known as life limited parts, which operate under the most stress in a jet engine and are carefully monitored by manufacturers while operating on the plane. However, even dodgy fastenings have claimed lives. Partnair Flight 394 crashed off the coast of Denmark in September 1989, killing all 55 passengers and crew after its tail fin came off. Three of the four bolts holding the fin in place were counterfeit and weaker than those designed for the plane. The weak bolts and other maintenance problems allowed vibrations that caused the rudder to fail and break off, investigators later found. Following that incident and other bogus parts scandals, Mary Schiavo, who was Inspector General at the US Department of Transportation in the early 1990s, ran a campaign against the sale of unapproved aircraft parts and helped secure more than a hundred criminal convictions. She uncovered bogus components that had been made by manufacturers that had lost their certification to make the parts, old equipment passed off as new, re-labelled defective parts and outright fakes that were never designed for aviation use. These are largely the categories into which bad parts still fall, she says. Unapproved parts were even found in part of a fire control system on Air Force One in 1995, she said. Literally, if it is on an aeroplane, it could be fake. Following her investigation, various reforms came in, including a warning system to flag suspicious components. I have had cases where counterfeit parts have caused deaths. What is at stake is the safety of the lives of the flying public. While plane and engine manufacturers, pilots and aviation companies are heavily regulated, distributors are not, she warns. She pushed for tighter rules in the 90s but was ignored. The High Court case against AOG began on September 21 and is ongoing. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has said it is supporting the US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency in investigating the matter. A spokesman for CFM said: We are working collaboratively with operators so they can promptly remove the unauthorised parts from their engines in accordance with the recommendations issued by the regulatory agencies. We remain united with the aviation community in working to keep unapproved parts out of the global supply chain. BH was approached for comment.

Bankman-Fried, whose stake in FTX and the Alameda Research hedge fund was once estimated to be worth as much as 26 billion on paper, faces seven decades in jail on a series of federal charges related to oversight of the now-bankrupt firms. The former friend Adam Yedidia was a college friend of Bankman-Fried at MIT and worked as a software engineer for FTX in 2021-22. He said he informed Bankman-Fried in June 2022 that 8 billion in FTX customers' cash was missing, and that they later discussed the missing money in person. He said Bankman-Fried seemed unusually nervous during their conversation, and acknowledged that FTX was vulnerable. Despite that, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried. In November 2022, when the business was collapsing and people were leaving, he wrote to him on Signal and said, I love you Sam. I am not going anywhere. Yedidia said that changed when he learned FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to Alameda's creditors, which he called flagrantly wrong. After that, he resigned. He was then asked why he lost faith in the company and quit. FTX defrauded all its customers, Yedidia said. The answer was stricken from the court record. The co-founder Bankman-Fried appeared visibly upset at times during the testimony of FTX co-founder and technology chief Gary Wang. He looked at the ground at times and once put his head in his hands while Wang was on the stand. Wang told the court about the days before Alameda and FTX failed. He said the firm's leaders considered shutting Alameda down, but could not because it owed roughly 14 billion and had no way to pay it back. Asked about a tweet by Bankman-Fried that said, Assets are fine, Wang said, FTX was not fine and assets were not fine. The star witness Caroline Ellison, Alameda's CEO and Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend, said that he told her to steal some 10 billion from FTX's customers and use it to repay firms that had lent money to Alameda. Sam directed me to commit these crimes, Ellison said near the beginning of several days of testimony. She also testified that Bankman-Fried instructed her to mislead lenders to make the firm's finances look better than they actually were -- a way to stop those lenders from getting nervous and asking for their money back. Ellison's personal relationship with Bankman-Fried was discussed at times during her testimony. While Ellison was on the stand for three full days, the two appeared to avoid looking at each other throughout. Ellison broke down in tears after prosecutors shared messages where she told Bankman-Fried that she was relieved the truth about FTX and Alameda was finally coming out. Ellison, like Wang and another top FTX executive, Nishad Singh, have pleaded guilty to a series of fraud-related criminal charges and are cooperating with the government's prosecution of Bankman-Fried in the hope of getting their own prison sentences reduced. The final days of FTX and Alameda Research Christian Drappi, a former software engineer for Alameda, testified about the final days before FTX and Alameda failed. He said Ellison told him that FTX had a shortfall of users funds because Alameda had been borrowing them. He said he was shocked to learn about that. While Drappi was on the stand, the prosecution played a recording of a company meeting led by Ellison. It was secretly taped by another employee who gave it to Drappi. In the recording, Ellison tells employees that FTX does not have enough funds to give all of its users their money back, and is trying to raise funds. Drappi says he is surprised because a firm would usually raise money to fund their operations, not to fill a hole in a company's balance sheet. He then asks Ellison if the loan was collateralized in a standard way. She says it was not. The final witness of the week was Zac Prince. He is also the CEO of a crypto company that went under -- not an exchange like FTX, where digital currencies like Bitcoin are traded, but a company that lent to other businesses in the industry. Prince's company, BlockFi, lent more than 1 billion to Alameda Research over a few years, and he said the company always made payments on time. He also saw Alameda's balance sheets every quarter, and based on those, he thought the company was in very good shape. He said he did not know Alameda was taking money from FTX, or about loans it made to insiders like Bankman-Fried, and would not have lent to Alameda if he would known the true state of its finances. When the crypto market fell sharply in mid-2022, BlockFi was also hit hard. It struck a deal with FTX in which borrowed from BlockFi and also had an option to buy it. It also made more loans to Alameda. Prince testified that BlockFi had 350 million on FTX in late 2022. He said that it ultimately lost 1 billion when Alameda and FTX filed for bankruptcy, and testified that it would not have happened if Alameda had been able to pay back its loans.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Bankman-Fried faces seven decades in jail on a series of federal charges related to oversight of the now-bankrupt firms.

The labor contract between the United Auto Workers and the Detroit Three automakers expired with no new deal or even a tentative agreement in place. As warned, the UAW launched a targeted strike on Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram Trucks, immediately. These are answers to common questions about the historic 2023 strike: Why is the UAW strike called 'targeted'? In 2019, the UAW called a strike on GM and all workers at all the company sites walked off the job. That is a traditional strike. Every worker pickets together. This time, the UAW is targeting certain sites across all three Detroit automakers to achieve minimum loss of work and maximum pain on companies. So while workers at some plants are on strike, other factory workers from the same company continue to work. It is also unusual to negotiate with three automakers at once. Who pays striking UAW workers? The union pays workers 500 a week strike pay from the union strike fund supported by member dues. In exchange, the workers are required to sign up for strike duty that involves taking shifts on the picket line that often last four to six hours at a time. Some striking workers are assigned, or volunteer, to prepare food and coffee for striking workers. At no time is a strike line outside a factory or warehouse on strike without picketing. The shifts run 24 hours. Working UAW members often volunteer to walk the strike line with union brothers and sisters after their work shifts end. What are the sticking points? The UAW is working to get a contract that recovers benefits lost by retirees, boosts pay and benefits for current hourly workers, restores cost-of-living adjustment payments for inflation and creates protections for workers in the future who may be impacted by the industry transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Restoring retirement benefits lost during the Great Recession is top of mind. The topic of battery plants have been a key issue. Has there been progress on UAW talks with the automakers? Ford, GM and Stellantis have all proposed double-digit wage increases and Ford has touted what it calls the best UAW contract proposal in 80 years. There is no question the UAW has pushed the companies to improve overall packages but UAW leaders say the companies can do more to reward workers who help make the huge profits that reward stockholders. The UAW touted a battery plant agreement with GM on October 6. Which Ford, GM, Stellantis plants are on strike? Ford: Michigan Assembly in Wayne (Bronco, Ranger truck), Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville (F-Series Super Duty truck, Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator) and Chicago Assembly in Illinois (Explorer, Police Interceptor Utility, Lincoln Aviator). GM: Wentzville Assembly in Missouri (Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon trucks, Chevy Express and GMC Savana vans), Lansing Delta Township Assembly (Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse), and all 18 parts distribution centers nationally known as Customer Care and Aftersales facilities. Stellantis: Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio (Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Gladiator), and all 20 parts distribution centers nationally. How many autoworkers are on strike? An estimated 34,000 UAW autoworkers were striking as of October 12, according to the union. Workers say they are ready to return to work but they are loyal to union solidarity. Have other businesses been affected by the strike? Auto suppliers have seen work slowdowns and shutdowns, as well as businesses in the areas around factories and warehouses. Suppliers have had to lay off workers in response to the strike. And the Detroit Three have had to lay off workers because of the production disruption, a rolling number that continues to grow. For example, Ford has laid off an estimated 2,000 workers at six locations because of 16,000 striking workers at three auto plants, as of Thursday. Ford predicts 13 sites will be immediately impacted by the Kentucky Truck shutdown. GM and Stellantis are reeling, too. How big is the 2023 strike compared to the 2019 strike? So far, this UAW strike against automakers is smaller in size and scope than the UAW strike four years ago. In 2019, the UAW ran a strike campaign against GM that lasted 40 days and shut down every single facility and all its 48,000 workers left their jobs nationally. How affected are car dealerships by the strike? Some parts warehouses may be staffed by salaried workers and, in some places, strikers and reporters have witnessed nonunion temporary workers bused in but, overall, the strike is expected to impact availability of cars on the lots. Additionally, parts needed for repairs on GM, Jeep, Chrysler, Ram Trucks and Dodge vehicles are expected to be delayed or unavailable. How does the UAW strike impact the transition to EVs? The plants targeted by the strikes, all producing gasoline-powered vehicles, generate the money needed to invest in manufacturing that will build the electric vehicles. When will the 2023 UAW strike end? People close to negotiations have speculated that the UAW strike on Ford, GM and Stellantis could last longer than the 2019 strike and push into November. Meanwhile, union and company officials say they are working to get good deals as quickly as possible.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The UAW launched a targeted strike on Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram Trucks, immediately.

What does it change?,"The White House announced on October 13 that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition to bolster Russia's war against Ukraine. Washington published pictures tracking a set of containers as it traveled from Najin, North Korea, to Dunay, Russia, by a Russian-flagged vessel. The supplies were then reportedly moved by rail to an ammunition depot in southwestern Russia near Tikhoretsk, roughly 200 kilometers from Ukraine's state border. We condemn (North Korea) for providing the Russians with this military equipment, YOU.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. The weapons would be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby added. While the news of an armaments delivery from North Korea to Russia was unsettling, it was not unexpected. Read also: Can Russia afford to commit to a years-long war? North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un arrived in Russia for a six-day tour of the country's far east last month, visiting an aircraft plant, inspecting the Admiral Shaposhnikov frigate, and meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Experts suggested that Moscow could furnish North Korea with the technology they needed for its struggling spy satellite program in return for Pyongyang's stockpile of Soviet-era weaponry - primarily artillery shells that could be used by Russian guns in Ukraine. The news of military cooperation confirms that we have entered a new era of Russia-North Korea relations. But it also poses a new question: What happens next for Moscow, Pyongyang, and the silent Beijing? Russia and North Korea have a longstanding relationship despite Pyongyang's zealous isolationism. In 2000, the two countries signed a treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation, and Moscow is one of just a handful of countries to maintain an embassy in Pyongyang. There have been multiple reports of North Korean hackers working from Russian territory, and North Korean laborers working in industries such as logging. But Russia and North Korea's relationship is not as simple or straightforward. Moscow has also supported numerous UN resolutions imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, including in 2010, 2013, and 2017. President Putin told reporters after Kim Jong-Un's visit that Moscow would uphold these sanctions, despite earlier remarks from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the resolutions had been made during a completely different geopolitical situation. Rather than an ongoing commitment, the latest chapter is more likely to consist of both sides exploiting global events to further their own ends. Moscow is looking not only for ammunition but also support for its aggression in Ukraine. North Korea is one of only a handful of countries to recognize Russian illegal territorial gains and consistently vote against UN resolutions supporting Ukraine. For now, the situation is still purely based on the idea that we will give you something, and we want something in exchange. There is no ideological cooperation, says Natalia Matiaszczyk, an expert at the Polish think tank Institute of New Europe. Support from North Korea is something Russia uses to legitimize its illegal actions on Ukraine territory. In many ways, this is as important as receiving the weapons themselves -- particularly as North Korea's ammunition stockpile is believed to be not only outdated but also of low quality. It is by no means certain that such ammunition could make a significant difference on the front line. But many outsiders underestimate North Korea's own agency. Pyongyang is also seizing a new diplomatic space that has opened up as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, says Yong-Chool Ha, director of the Center for Korea Studies at the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington. North Koreans have been suffering from the severe impact of the sanctions that have been imposed upon them, he says. But this is a new sort of opportunity and the evolution of a new diplomatic horizon, and we can see that in North Korea's behavior toward Russia. Read also: Kyiv, Moscow's opposing attitudes toward Soviet past shape two different futures And while the invasion of Ukraine has given North Korea new opportunities, it does not mean that it is an issue that holds a particular imperative for Pyongyang. For North Korea, Kim Jong-Un's visit to Russia was more of a signal of the country's re-opening after Covid 19 than of the country's stance in European affairs. After more than three years of closed borders due to Covid, North Korea is now opening back up slightly. North Koreans who were based abroad are now being allowed to come back, there has been news that soon, even foreigners will be allowed to visit. This is a huge change in domestic policy, says Tereza Novotna, a Korea-Europe Center Fellow at the Free University Berlin. Novotna points out that it was not just military facilities that featured in Kim Jong-Un's Russian itinerary. Kim Jong-Un also visited both an aquarium (where the North Korean leader was applauded by a walrus) and the ballet (although Russian news outlets reported he left after the first act). After the lockdown ended in Europe, we were so happy to finally go on vacation, says Novotna. Well, Kim Jong-Un's lockdown just ended now, and he went on vacation too. North Korea, however, is unlikely to provide Moscow with ammunition purely as thanks for a pleasant post-Covid trip. If Pyongyang shipped shells to Russia, what can it expect in return? Despite Putin's public remarks, it remains unclear whether the Kremlin could defy international sanctions and supply military technology to Pyongyang. In his October 13 press conference, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believed Pyongyang wanted advanced Russian technologies for the North Korean military and nuclear program. Other experts believe that other types of technological exchange could be more likely. North Korea has recently been working on a satellite program but has so far faced two failed launches, says Matiaszczyk. Maybe that is what North Korea wants from Russia, a new technology that will help successfully send these satellites into orbit, she says. Real exchange between Moscow and Pyongyang is also likely to be hampered by the reaction of officials in Beijing. China is North Korea's largest trade partner, and Pyongyang relies heavily on Beijing's economic aid. Increased cooperation with Russia could be an attempt to reduce that dependency -- but China will not want its influence in the region to be diminished by the Kremlin and could make their displeasure known. Beijing currently also hopes to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and good relations with a number of other global powers, says Matiaszczyk. Russian tech deliveries to North Korea could endanger both of these goals. In the context of the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese authorities primarily seek to prevent escalation. That is why in the past, when North Korea pursued aggressive politics and nuclear testing, China supported the UN Security Council resolution against North Korea, says Matiaszczyk. Tightening cooperation between North Korea and Russia will also force the YOU.S., Japan, and South Korea to deepen their cooperation, including militarily, and that is something China really does not want. Read also: Even after sanctions, Russian economy can pay for war Then there is the question of the UN Security Council. If Russia violates UN sanctions, then the council will be forced to meet to discuss the situation. Although Moscow would be able to veto new sanctions, the scenario would still see Beijing in a difficult position. If Chinese officials voted in favor of a resolution, it would damage ties with Moscow. Still, if it were to abstain or vote against, China's international reputation and relationship with the West could be further damaged. China would be in a very awkward position, says Matiaszczyk. That is not to say that North Korea would be unhappy to see Beijing face such an uncomfortable diplomatic conundrum. In fact, Pyongyang has always been skilled at playing international powers off each other, says Novotna. North Korea could well try to exploit such a situation to gain maximum benefit from both Moscow and Beijing. I do not think there is ever been much love lost between North Korea and China. China has always been seen as a country that North Korea is dependent on -- and that there is no way to avoid that, she says. Yet, ultimately, it remains unlikely that Russia could replace China as a partner for North Korea. I do not think North Koreans would like to alienate China at this point, frankly. I do not think Russia could be a substitute for China either, says Ha. China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea's trade -- not Russia. Some commentators have raised the prospect that closer North Korean-Russia ties could pave the way for a new geopolitical power bloc comprising of Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang. But, most regional experts believe this risk is largely overstated. Rather than having a single outlook, each of these three countries has its own goals, needs, and relationships with each other. Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang also have their own separate relationships with other Asian countries. Rather than China, Russia, and North Korea rushing to form their own three-state bloc, a looser Eurasian alignment that involves other nations, such as certain Central Asian states, could be a more likely geopolitical outcome, says Ha. He believes that Kim Jong-Un is increasingly concerned about North Korea's place in southeast Asia, particularly after the Camp David summit in August when leaders from the YOU.S., South Korea, and Japan met to discuss greater military cooperation. The North Korean leader would later describe the alliance as the Asian version of NATO, the root because of war and aggression, and claimed the start of a new Cold War. I think Kim Jong-Un's perception of the emerging regional world and what is happening surrounding the Korean Peninsula was a factor in this meeting with Putin, says Ha. With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the strategic world map also changed dramatically. The Camp David summit was a clear indication of that drastic change in the security environment not only around the Korean Peninsula, but in East Asia in general. But this wider regional picture means that European nations should also try to engage in wider dialogue on North Korean-Russian issues. NATO should maintain close cooperation with allies like South Korea and Japan both in political, economic, and also military aspects, says Matiaszczyk, and should at least try to work with China. Europe also should not dismiss the idea of engaging with North Korea itself. I would advise the West not to see North Korea through the lens of Russia or Moscow's war on Ukraine, says Novotna. Now that North Korea is re-opening, it is a good moment to kind of restart European engagement with North Korea, and to think again about how to do it better than we did before, she says. It would be good to think about how to do this without putting Pyongyang into the same basket as Russia or Beijing and thinking of them as one entity because once we start doing this, that is what is actually going to happen, Novotna adds. We still have a chance for different policies.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The White House announced on October 13 that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition to Russia.

The US and EU have both imposed sanctions on dozens of companies and individuals involved in the construction of the Crimean Bridge, expanding the sanctions they initially deployed against Moscow over Crimea's 2014 referendum in favor of becoming part of Russia - a move the West and the government in Kiev refer to as an illegal annexation. Since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in 2022, Kiev has openly sought to destroy the bridge, which both countries view as a critically important strategic link and a symbol of Moscow's permanence in Crimea.

He and his neighbors cut the avocados with the owners permission and sell them to motorists at a nearby toll booth or on the streets of the nearby city of Valencia, which has not emptied out as much as San Joaquin from migration over the last decade. They live day by day. Their pension these days amounts to 3.70 a month, only 20 cents more than the cost of a gallon of bottled water. So no sales mean no food. Sometimes, we even have to barter avocados for food in other neighborhoods. We want jobs! Hernandez, 67, exclaimed while sitting on his dusty, cement-floor porch with a neighbor. He was a carrier, I sold merchandise downtown. Right now, there is no work. All the young people have already left. This neighborhood is desolate! The political, social and economic crisis that has come to define their South American homeland has evolved since it began a decade ago as a result of a global drop in the price of oil, Venezuela's most valuable resource, mismanagement by the self-proclaimed socialist administration and government repression of its opponents. The latest phase has been particularly challenging after the economic stability that many experienced for several months overlapping 2021 and 2022 vanished. They again are grappling with constant food-price hikes, business closures and painful thoughts of migrating. FILE - People shop at a street market in the Petare neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela, October 4, 2023. (AP PhotoMatias Delacroix, File) Amid this daily reality, Venezuelans are hearing election chatter as the opposition gets ready to hold a primary October 22 to pick a candidate to challenge President Nicols Maduro in a presidential election next year. But apathy and disgust toward politics and politicians - be they Maduro, his allies or his adversaries - have deepened among the young and old amid the litany of disappointments, corruption accusations, rampant misinformation and government repression. Maduros government managed to get Venezuela out of a hyperinflationary cycle at the end of 2021 with public spending cuts, tax increases and foreign currency injections. For a time last year, workers could pull out of their pockets a dollar or two and maybe even some worthless bolivares, the local currency. Practically everyone knew someone running a business from their home, such as selling sugar-free snacks via Instagram or offering group lessons on basic math. The respite - coming after Venezuela's economy contracted 80 from 2014 into 2021 - even prompted some Venezuelans to return from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and other Latin American countries that had hosted them for years but where they could not find work in a post-pandemic economy. It also slowed down the exodus from Venezuela. But by January, the stability was gone. May 1 came and went without the presidents traditional Labor Day announcement of a minimum wage increase. The last raise, in April 2022, put monthly pay at 130 bolivares, which at the time was worth 30, but has now dwindled to 3.70. These days, a kilo (2.2 pounds) of chicken costs about 2.40, a dozen eggs is 2.25, and a liter (a little over a quart) of milk goes for 2. Things got very difficult. Even getting sick is difficult because if you buy food, you cant buy medicine, Mayela Ramirez, 59, said standing by her front door in downtown Valencia, once home to multiple auto assembly plants. I have a nephew who has a problem with his brain - he has like a ball growing there - and needs a biopsy, but he cant (afford it) because it is 150, so we are doing raffles to raise money. Ramirez helps her husband run his auto repair shop, but it is no longer uncommon for a week to go by without a single car being dropped off. It has been a long time since she shopped freely at the grocery store, where she now buys more vegetables than ever because protein sources are too expensive. She has noticed people have begun leaving the country again, including four of her neighbors who migrated at the end of September. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled their country, mostly to Latin American and Caribbean countries. But these days, people are migrating with their eyes set on the YOU.S. and not Colombia or Peru, which have received the largest number of Venezuelans since the crisis began. Over the last year, the number of Venezuelan migrants trying to enter the YOU.S. through its southern border has increased exponentially. YOU.S. border patrol agents in the last 11 months had more than 199,500 encounters with Venezuelans at the YOU.S.-Mexico border, compared with 2,700 in all 2020. In August alone, the encounters were more than 31,400. Venezuelans have come to feel the crisis as one numbingly featureless expanse of struggles, though they use some of its bigger calamities to parse out one year from another: 2017 had mass anti-Maduro protests and repression; 2018 saw severe food shortages; 2019 brought nationwide power outages; 2020 had days-long gas station lines. Worries are growing as people see many of these woes striking all at once, even in the capital, Caracas, whose residents had been partially insulated from some of the crisis challenges. The variety of products at supermarket shelves and neighborhood markets is getting smaller. Imported-goods stores put goods on the front edge of shelves to give the appearance of being fully stocked. Restaurants are closing. Refilling a gas tank with subsidized fuel again involves careful planning. Hours-long power outages are more frequent in Caracas. Many long for the days of el Comandante - the late President Hugo Chvez and his self-described socialist revolution of the 2000s. But regardless of political affiliation, Venezuelans are increasingly feeling like pawns in a geopolitical game that ignores their empty wallets. A 12-hour stretch one recent day illustrated that growing sentiment. Around 9:30 a.m., the highway that goes by San Joaquin was blocked by soldiers purportedly for unsafe conditions due to downed electrical wires, but they moved aside roughly two hours later after local leaders verified that Maria Corina Machado, the frontrunner in the oppositions presidential primary, had left the area. By 4:30 p.m., the YOU.S. government, whose economic sanctions failed to topple Maduro, flipped-flopped on its definition of safety for Venezuelans when it announced the resumption of deportation flights to the South American country. The announcement came just two weeks after it had expanded protections for about 500,000 Venezuelan migrants citing increased instability and lack of safety in the country. Around 6 p.m., news of the flights spread on social media and thousands of people rallied with Machado in Valencia. An hour later, the attorney general announced on national television a new criminal investigation against Juan Guaid, an exiled opposition leader who ran a parallel government to Maduros with the help of the YOU.S. The government needs to be removed, but right now, right now, what is affecting us Venezuelans is the economy, said Vanessa Martinez, 31, who does maintenance at a rest stop for about 60 a month and was unaware of the oppositions primary. Here, one lives day to day, she said. The situation is very sad. Who knows when well see a change. FILE - Homes cover a hill in the Petare neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela, Monday, October 2, 2023.

Borrell, who is on a three-day China visit, also told a press conference he has asked Beijing to use its influence to make Russia go back to a grain deal initiative to allow the resumption of Ukraine grain exports via the Black Sea. Otherwise, we will face another food crisis, he said, noting the war has sent shock waves around the world. Moscow has pulled out of the grain deal mediated by Turkey and the United Nations. 11:30 a.m. Russian forces pounded the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka for the fourth day in a row on Friday. In Avdiivka, known for its large coking plant in Ukraine's Donbas industrial heartland, officials said the Russian assaults had left the already-gutted city in flames. The fighting has been going on for four consecutive days, Vitaliy Barabash, head of the city's military administration, told Ukrainian national television. They have substantial reserves of personnel and equipment. Avdiivka is completely ablaze. They shoot, using everything they have. The hospital is again under fire, as are administrative buildings and our volunteer center. 12:30 a.m. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine, Prime Minister Mark Rutte says, according to Reuters. This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric air strikes, Rutte says following a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Odessa, Ukraine. Rutte says the Netherlands would also help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to help keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Friday, October 13 11:10 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says on the key topic of his upcoming visit to China would be the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing's plan for global infrastructure and energy networks it launched a decade ago. Putin said he would also discuss settlements in national currencies with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing next week. Thursday, October 12 10:48 p.m. The International Olympic Committee's executive board says it has suspended the Russian Olympic Committee with immediate effect for including regional sports organizations in Ukraine as ROC members, since this violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine's National Olympic Committee. The ROC had recognized Olympic Councils from the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia -- parts of Ukraine that Russia has unilaterally declared as part of itself. The ROC is no longer entitled to operate as a National Olympic Committee ... and cannot receive any funding from the Olympic Movement, said the IOC, which reserves the right to decide about the participation of individual neutral athletes with a Russian passport in the Olympic Games Paris 2024 and the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 at the appropriate time.

The Czech-made supplies, financed from the Danish budget, would include tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, handguns and ammunition. 4:28 p.m. The Russian ruble leaped more than 3 on Thursday to a more than two-week high past 96 to the dollar after President Vladimir Putin ordered the mandatory sale of foreign currency revenues for some exporters to buttress the Russian currency. The ruble collapsed to a record low in the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, after which authorities imposed similar capital controls that saw the rouble recover to a seven-year high. But it has charted a steadily downward course this year, under pressure from capital outflows, falling exports and recovering imports. 3:48 p.m. Russia and India are in discussions about a summit between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year, India's ambassador to Moscow was quoted by Russian news agency RIA as saying. It is being discussed. There are high-level discussions going on, Ambassador Pavan Kapoor said. 1:25 a.m. The YOU.S. says it will send up to 200 million in military supplies to Ukraine in its latest package of support. The package includes additional air defense capabilities, anti-tank weapons, additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other equipment, according to a statement from the Pentagon. 12:02 a.m. Ukraine received a 1.15 billion grant from the YOU.S. as part of the PEACE in Ukraine program, reports Reuters, citing the Ukrainian Finance Ministry. The PEACE (Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance) in Ukraine project has been the World Bank's flagship financing instrument for Kyiv during the war. Wednesday, October 11 11:55 p.m. Denmark, the Netherlands and the YOU.S. will spearhead a new international coalition to help Ukraine establish a future air force based on F-16 fighter jets, the Danish Defense Ministry said, according to Reuters. The new coalition intends to build infrastructure around F-16s, including maintenance facilities to support the operation of the planes, the ministry said in a statement. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first two countries to commit to donating F-16 jets to Ukraine, which currently has an air force fleet of aging Soviet-era fighter jets. 6:00 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked NATO allies on Wednesday for more weapons and air defense systems to tide his country over another wartime winter as it braces for a further barrage of Russian attacks on power stations and infrastructure. Zelenskyy was making his first visit to NATO headquarters since Russia's invasion last year, at a time when turbulence in the YOU.S. Congress threatens to disrupt aid for Kyiv and world attention is being drawn to the crisis unfolding in Israel. 2:30 p.m. China will host its third Belt and Road Forum next week, its foreign ministry says, a signature event for President Xi Jinping that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is due to attend on a rare trip abroad. The Beijing conference on October 17-18 marks the 10th anniversary of the Xi-championed Belt and Road Initiative. Representatives from many developing countries, notably from Latin America and Africa, are expected to attend. Putin attended the two previous forums, in 2017 and 2019, and the Kremlin said in September he had accepted an invitation to next week's gathering and for talks with Xi. 7:30 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the recent violence between Israel and the Palestinians showed that YOU.S. policy had failed in the Middle East and had ignored the needs of Palestinians. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin was in touch with both sides and would seek a role in resolving the conflict. Peskov warned that the conflict risked spilling over into other regions. During talks with visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, Putin blamed the escalation on years of YOU.S. policy. I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East, he said. 1:13 a.m. Germany announces new support for Ukraine, with a roughly 1 billion euro (1.06 billion) air defense package and a more than 20 million euro package of vehicles, weapons and personal equipment. The air defense package includes the Patriot and IRIS-T systems. Germany is thus further increasing the operational readiness of the Ukrainian armed forces in the coming months, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius says. 1:00 a.m. Russia fails in its bid to return to the United Nations' top human rights body. In a secret ballot, Russia won 83 votes versus 160 for Bulgaria and 123 for Albania, which had competed against it in the same eastern Europe grouping for two seats on the Geneva-based Human Rights Council for a three-year term beginning on January 1. Tuesday, October 10 11:01 p.m. A subsea gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia under the Baltic Sea have been damaged in what may have been a deliberate act, the Finnish government says, according to Reuters. The Balticconnector gas pipeline was shut early on Sunday on concerns that gas was leaking from a hole in the 77-kilometer pipeline. Finnish operator Gasgrid said it could take months or more to repair. 10:07 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he had good news on artillery and air defense supplies after talks with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in Bucharest, but gave no details, reports Reuters. My main accent today was air defense. And I am glad that Ukraine was heard by the Romanian side, Zelenskyy, who has been seeking more arms to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion, tells a joint press conference in the Romanian capital. 3:20 p.m. Russia launched 36 Iranian-made attack drones against southern Ukraine overnight, damaging infrastructure in the Odesa region, authorities say. The strikes targeted the Odesa, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian military reported, adding that air defense systems destroyed 27 drones. Odesa's governor, Oleh Kiper, said unspecified logistics infrastructure had been struck but that no injuries were reported. 10:00 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to hold talks in the Kremlin on Tuesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani on bilateral issues and the developing situation in the Middle East. Issues of developing multifaceted Russian-Iraqi cooperation, as well as current topics on the international agenda, primarily the situation in the Middle East, will be discussed in detail, the Kremlin said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. 7:00 a.m. Top United Nations trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russian officials in Moscow on Monday for talks aimed at enabling unimpeded access to global markets for grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine, a YOU.N. spokesperson said. YOU.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths attended the meetings virtually, YOU.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues in his determination to facilitate the unimpeded access to global markets for food products and fertilizers from both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, Dujarric added. 2:10 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says on Monday that it was in Russia's interests to stoke war in the Middle East to weaken global unity. Based on available information -- very clear information -- it is in Russia's interests to inflame war in the Middle East to create a new source of pain and suffering that would weaken global unity, create divisions and help Russia in undermining freedom in Europe, Zelenskyy says in his nightly video address. Zelenskyy says Russians propagandists were gloating at developments and that Iran, which he described as Moscow's ally, was openly supporting those attacking Israel. In a call on Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Zelenskyy says Ukraine was in solidarity with Israel, which is enduring a brazen, large-scale attack. Sunday, October 8 5:35 a.m. Russia's Defence Ministry says the country's air defense systems detected and destroyed two Ukrainian S-200 anti-aircraft missiles, thwarting attacks it says Kyiv attempted four hours apart on the Crimean Peninsula. 4:00 a.m. Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia's Chechnya region and close ally of President Vladimir Putin, says a presidential election due next March should either be postponed due to the war in Ukraine or limited to one candidate, Putin. The Kremlin leader has said he will not announce if he will run before parliament calls the election, which by law it is due to do in December. I propose now, while the 'special military operation' is under way, to unanimously decide that we will have one candidate in the elections -- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, Kadyrov was quoted as saying by the state-run RIA news agency at a rally in the Chechen capital Grozny to mark Putin's October 7 birthday that was attended by thousands. 3:15 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin announces the start of gas supplies to Uzbekistan via Kazakhstan in a meeting with his counterparts from the two countries in Moscow. This is the largest trilateral energy project among the three ex-Soviet countries, Putin said, after formally launching the shipment. Under a two-year deal signed with Russia's Gazprom, Uzbekistan will import 9 million cubic meters of Russian natural gas per day. 12:15 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemns what he called a terrorist attack on Israel after a surprise assault by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and backed the country's right to self-defense. Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world, he wrote on the social media platform X. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment. Saturday, October 7 9:30 p.m. Rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border rose sharply this week to the highest in years, suggesting arms supply by Pyongyang to Moscow after their leaders discussed deeper military cooperation, a YOU.S. think tank says. Satellite imagery showed an unprecedented 73 or so freight cars at Tumangang Rail Station in the North Korean border city of Rason, the Beyond Parallel Project of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report. The traffic was far greater than that observed in the past five years, including pre-pandemic levels, it says. 6:00 a.m. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's envoy to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, says Moscow will revoke its ratification of the pact, a move that Washington denounced as endangering the global norm against nuclear test blasts. Ulyanov said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Russia plans to revoke ratification (which took place in 2000) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The aim is to be on equal footing with the US who signed the Treaty, but did not ratify it. Revocation does not mean the intention to resume nuclear tests. 1:30 a.m. The YOU.S. Commerce Department has added 42 Chinese companies to a government export control list over support for Moscow's military and defense industrial base, including supplying the Russian sector YOU.S.-origin integrated circuits. Another seven entities from Finland, Germany, India, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom were also added to the trade export control list. The circuits include microelectronics that Russia uses for precision guidance systems in missiles and drones launched against civilian targets in Ukraine, the Commerce Department said in a statement. Today's additions to the Entity List provide a clear message: if you supply the Russian defense sector with YOU.S.-origin technology, we will find out, and we will take action, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said in the statement.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"EU foreign policy chief urges China not to support Russia in its war against Ukraine.

A day after murderous terrorists invaded Israel, critical infrastructure connecting frontline NATO allies was shut down as a result of external activity -- possibly foreign sabotage -- according to Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. Russia sympathizes with us, senior Hamas official Ali Baraka said in a Sunday interview on the government-controlled Russia Today TV. One war eases the pressure in another war. While Finnish and Estonian officials are still investigating the disruption of a pipeline and communication cable, the timing is likely no coincidence. If it resulted from foreign action, then the foreign agents took advantage of the fact that world attention was focused elsewhere to carry out an operation they had likely already planned. Did Russia have prior knowledge of Hamas's invasion plan? Russia has long weaponized its monopolistic position as Europe's oil supplier to extract political concessions from dependent neighbors by cutting off energy supplies. The Balticonnector Pipeline began operations in 2020, connecting Finland to the rest of Europe via Estonia and reducing Russia's oil leverage over both countries. Russia would clearly benefit from disabling the pipeline. Both countries are pro-western states on Russia's border and view the USSR's primary successor state as their greatest threat. In April, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Finland officially joined the anti-Russian NATO alliance, which Estonia joined in 2004. Yet, according to Baraka's interview in a Russian propaganda outlet, Russia was notified prior to the assault. In order to keep the attack secret and successful, the different factions and our allies did not know the zero hour, he said. But Hamas did update Russia after they inquired about the Hamas attack and its intention. If Russia is responsible for the Balticonnector sabotage, they implemented the plan opportunistically. Russia was not the only ally Hamas informed of its plans on Saturday. After half an hour of commencing the attack, all the Palestinian resistance factions were contacted, as were our allies in Hezbollah and Iran, said Baraka. He added that they even notified Turkey -- an increasingly rogue member of NATO -- and met with them only three hours into the operation. Our allies are those that support us with weapons and money, explained Baraka. First and foremost, it is Iran that is giving us money and weapons. For years, Western intelligence officials have known that Iran was providing military training and logistical help. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said last year that Iran had provided the group with 70 million in military assistance. On Thursday, the YOU.S. government and Qatar agreed to block Iran from accessing 6 billion in funds the YOU.S. had unfrozen as an appeasement measure. Baraka also pointed to Hamas's close affinity with Hezbollah, another radical Islamic terror organization funded by Iran, but which is based in Lebanon instead of Gaza. Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel on Tuesday, in an effort to divide Israel's forces and limit the safe places where refugees from southern Israel could be temporarily relocated. Baraka also boasted that the Arab and Islamic people ... are standing by us. Even if he presumes too much when speaking for all people who identify as Muslims, these are not idle words; on Sunday, Palestinian sympathizers staged demonstrations in support of Hamas' barbarous tactics across the West. Even Russia sympathizes with us, added Baraka. Russia is happy that America is getting embroiled in Palestine. It alleviates the pressure on the Russians in Ukraine. One war eases the pressure in another war. So, we are not alone on the battlefield. He said that Russia, a major exporter of weapons, even gave a Russian license to produce Kalashnikov bullets in Gaza, allowing Hamas to procure additional ammunition for Russian-made machine guns despite international sanctions. That is quite the international coalition supporting a terror group, but it features the usual suspects. Nations like Iran and Russia are not friendly toward the YOU.S. and would jump at any opportunity to knock the YOU.S. down a peg. Consequently, Hamas' attack did not happen in isolation. We have been preparing for this for two years, Baraka said. In other words, Hamas began preparing to launch a major assault against Israel in the immediate aftermath of America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some unconfirmed reports have even suggested that Hamas used weapons YOU.S. forces left behind in Afghanistan, which evidently made their way across the Middle East through illicit arms trading. When America's foes see us as weak, they calculate that it is time to strike. The same actors -- and even more of them -- are aligned on Russia's side of the conflict in Ukraine. After Ukraine stalled Russia's first assault and ground down its war machine with Western aid, Russia turned to other bad actors to restock its supplies. There have been reports that Iran, China, Cuba, North Korea, and even South Africa are supplying Moscow with military equipment and personnel. In October 2022, the Pentagon said they knew that Russia was using Iranian drones in Ukraine, and they believed Iranians were on-site to help the Russians operate them. In February, the Biden administration considered releasing intelligence that showed China was supplying arms to Russia. Customs records obtained by Politico this summer show that China has shipped body armor and other military munitions to Russia. In May, the YOU.S. ambassador to South Africa accused the allegedly neutral country with supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, via a sanctioned cargo ship it allowed to dock at a naval base near Cape Town in December. In September, the White House said North Korea and Russia were actively advancing arms negotiations, and satellite photos last week detected a near-quadrupling in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border. Even distant Cuba has gotten involved, smuggling hundreds of soldiers to fight in Russia's war. In addition to military assistance, American rivals on the world stage also cooperate economically. An organization of second-tier economic powers, known as BRICS (for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will more than double its membership in January 2024 when it officially admits Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the YOU.A.E. The organization, which includes some of the largest economies in Africa, Asia, and South America, is actively discussing ways to move international trade away from the YOU.S. dollar and towards other national currencies. BRICS expansion is significant because it indicates that even YOU.S. military allies, like India, or economic partners, like Saudi Arabia, are increasingly willing to cooperate with adversaries the YOU.S. has tried to isolate. Such interconnection in foreign policy is not a new development. Independent powers have combined into military coalitions since at least the time of Abraham (see Genesis 14:1-2). In the century between Napoleon and World War I (1814-1919), international politics particularly focused on the alliances between five to nine so-called great powers, which were ever-changing to maintain a precarious balance of power. This provoked a string of conflicts, culminating in two devastating world wars. After World War II, only two great powers remained (the YOU.S. and the Soviet Union), which spearheaded two worldwide coalitions (countries not aligned with either side were dubbed the third world). Due to the invention of nuclear weapons, the two great powers did not risk an all-out war, but they still struggled together in an economic Cold War and a series of proxy wars over influence in other countries -- Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua, Afghanistan. When the Soviet Union collapsed after four decades, the YOU.S. found itself in the rare position of a global hegemon -- a world power with no equal. The conflicts of this period -- two Iraq wars, Afghanistan, Serbia -- reflect America's ability to go anywhere in the world and do whatever we wanted, always dealing with asymmetric opponents. In the early 2000s, President Bush could call out by name an axis of evil, consisting of three countries, for the whole world to shun. But shifting alliances and changing power balances have changed the global situation once again. China's decades-long buildup and Russia's resurgence have placed the YOU.S. on the defensive in far-flung zones of influence. Part of this is from not recognizing the threat. America has largely let China's military buildup and global friend-buying projects go unanswered, and the YOU.S. has become consumed with internal divisions, which other nations may have played a role in aggravating. We stopped playing the game, while everyone else was playing harder than ever. Whatever the reason why a growing coalition of global adversaries is arrayed against America, a world in which the YOU.S. is not the all-dominant power is actually just a return to equilibrium, from a historical aberration. Most Americans today cannot remember anything different, but for most of history geopolitics has been a delicate balancing act, or very bloody. American ingenuity and freedoms can go a long way, at least with good leadership. But we cannot count on always being the unchallenged champion in an adversarial arena that incentivizes the rise of challengers -- especially when those challengers can combine together. The takeaway is that America cannot afford to view one hostile power or one national crisis in isolation. What is currently happening in Israel will affect the war in Ukraine, the security of Taiwan, and even the possibility of major terror strikes against American targets.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Hamas official: Russia sympathizes with us, senior Hamas official Ali Baraka said in a Sunday interview on the government-controlled Russia Today TV.

The center, which operates as an information outlet under the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in a Telegram post that supporters of Kyiv in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol sabotaged a Russian train that is used to bring daily supplies from Crimea to Melitopol and Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The result of the attack was an explosion that reportedly damaged a locomotive and 150 meters of railway.

Other high-profile rail sabotage acts include an explosion on a railway line in Crimea's Feodosia region in June and a May explosion that led to a derailment suspended rail traffic between Simferopol, Crimea's capital, and Sevastopol. According to the National Resistance Center of Ukraine, Friday's incident was the 10th successful sabotage on Russian railways carried out by partisans in the Zaporizhzhia region this year. Newsweek reached out to the National Resistance Center of Ukraine and the Russian Ministry of Defense via email for comment on Friday. The Ukrainian center said the train targeted on Friday not only brings supplies to Russian President Vladimir Putin's military personnel in Zaporizhzhia, but it also carries damaged equipment and stolen goods -- such as iron ore, grain and other property -- from Ukraine back to Crimea. The center's Telegram message said Russian troops surrounded the site of the attack after the explosion in an effort to conceal the sabotage took place while also searching for the guerrillas behind the attack. The National Resistance Center of Ukraine indicated the partisans behind the attack are safe and that they have promised to carry out more acts of sabotage in the future. Ukrainian partisans have been credited with key attacks throughout the war that Putin launched in February 2022. In August 2022, The Washington Post reported partisans were likely behind an attack on Russia's Saky air base in Crimea that triggered at least 12 explosions at the facility. Supporters of Ukraine within Russia also claimed responsibility for a wave of attacks in Russia's border regions, including several in Belgorod. In late-July, partisans were also said to be behind a mass poisoning during a Russian military celebration in the occupied city of Mariupol. According to a Ukrainian official, two Russian officers were killed and 15 other troops were hospitalized after partisans poisoned Kremlin forces as they celebrated Navy Day, a popular national holiday in Russia that honors members of the nation's naval forces.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,The National Resistance Center of Ukraine reported Ukrainian partisans blew up a Russian train on Friday.

President Joe Biden has been vocal about Israel's right to defend itself following a Hamas massacre that killed more than 1,300 civilians and soldiers in Israel. His remarks show he is prepared to give Israel a measure of latitude as the country's military pummels Hamas from land, air and sea. This was act of pure evil, Biden said Tuesday in a speech in which he outlined Hamas' atrocities. Yet in that same speech, Biden dropped in a brief, but telling, message about the need to avoid indiscriminate killing as the war moves into a coastal territory that is home to some 2 million people with no escape route. Biden said that in an earlier phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they discussed how strong democracies like Israel and the YOU.S. do not needlessly target civilians. Terrorists purposefully target civilians, kill them, he said. We uphold the laws of war -- the law of war. It matters. There is a difference. What he did not say in his speech, but NBC News later confirmed, is that Biden also urged the Israeli leader to take pains to minimize Palestinian casualties. Now, Biden administration officials are amplifying that cautionary note in their own private talks with Israeli counterparts, present and past YOU.S. officials said. In meetings in Israel on Friday, YOU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conveyed to both Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that it is important to observe international rules of warfare, two current YOU.S. officials familiar with Austin's message said. Austin advised that Israel operate on a higher moral plane than Hamas and be careful to avoid civilian casualties, they added. Austin conveyed to the Israelis that if they storm into Gaza and civilian casualties spike, the world's focus could shift from Hamas' abuses to the deaths resulting from the Israeli incursion, a current and former official said. We are trying to convince them the Israelis, but emotions are running high, the former official said. Still, the former official added that the Israelis have been listening to a certain extent, giving Palestinian civilians in Gaza advance warning to leave the north. The Biden administration is still workshopping precisely how to discuss a deadly Middle East conflict that caught the world unaware. A state department email Friday advised a small group of officials involved in public messaging to avoid using phrases like de-escalationceasefire, end to violencebloodshed and restoring calm, according to a YOU.S. official directly familiar with the email. That directive seems aimed at aligning the Biden administration with Israel's goal of vanquishing Hamas. Israelis have likened Hamas' surprise assault to the 911 terrorist attack in the YOU.S., spreading fear and outrage through the country. Israeli leaders are promising a devastating counterattack that crushes Hamas for good. Yet in doing so, they risk killing Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire and thereby squandering international sympathy and good will. If Israel expands the battlefield to other countries, they could overreach, much as then-President George W. Bush did in retaliation for the 911 attack. After rooting the Taliban in Afghanistan, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq in 2003 that resulted in a prolonged and deadly quagmire. Ben Rhodes was a national security official in President Barack Obama's administration and is close to Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser. On Friday, he wrote a post on the social media site X: The decisions being made now are going to impact millions of lives, reverberate for generations, and risk all kinds of escalation. The YOU.S. should have learned from 911 the profound cost of being guided by anger and fear. I hope that is what we are telling the Israeli government. It seems Biden is doing just that. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also visited Israel this week, said at a news conference in Qatar on Friday: We continue to discuss with Israel the importance of taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. We recognize that many Palestinian families in Gaza are suffering through no fault of their own and that Palestinian civilians have lost their lives. As a close ally that supplies Israel with billions in weapons and aid, the YOU.S. holds some leverage over how the country carries out its military operations. In the six days since Hamas attacked, the YOU.S. has sent a carrier strike group closer to Israel in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and provided the Israeli military with additional equipment and resources, including munitions, according to a statement from Austin. In addition, the YOU.S. is planning to replenish missile interceptors for Israel's Iron Dome. Over the years, past presidents have on occasion urged Israel to hold back in skirmishes with Hamas lest civilian deaths reach unacceptable levels. In 2014, for example, the Obama administration prevailed on Israel to de-escalate a conflict over rocket attacks coming from Gaza. Biden may need to have a similar conversation with Netanyahu as the war unfolds, Middle East experts said. Rest assured, there will come a time when the administration -- in response to an exponential rise in Palestinian casualties, and perhaps an Israel operation that appeared bogged down -- when the Biden administration will intercede, said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former Middle East analyst at the State Department. Biden, he added, may need to have a blunt come to Moses, Muhammad and Jesus conversation with the prime minister, getting him to show restraint.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Senior Biden administration officials are warning Israeli counterparts to show restraint.

Trump said Wednesday that Israel planned to be part of the January 2020 operation that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani but abruptly backed out the night before it was to take place.

They always thought it was a dangerous and destabilizing idea. One former Trump administration official familiar with the planning said that in Washington, when Trump made the decision to go ahead with the Soleimani strike, the generals who were present seemed to collectively take a deep breath. The CIA declined to comment. The Trump campaign, the YOU.S. military's Central Command and the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to requests for comment. If the former president's comments were accurate, it would have been a significant -- and classified -- revelation. Israel was going to do this with us, and it was being planned and working on it for months, Trump said Wednesday. We had everything all set to go, and the night before it happened, I got a call that Israel will not be participating in this attack. I will never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down, Trump added, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. That was a very terrible thing, he said. And then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That did not make me feel too good. Israeli intelligence helped confirm Soleimani's location for American intelligence officials, NBC News first reported at the time. The YOU.S. subsequently killed Soleimani with a drone strike in Baghdad. Israel was never part of the operation, the YOU.S. officials involved in the planning said. Trump is facing federal charges over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House.

An estimated 42 of grizzly rail collisions occur in the valley despite accounting for only 0.6 of the province's population. A shot from a rifle. A trap. Poison. For decades, a grizzly bear's encounter with a humanity's footprint often meant death as settlers spread across North America. Grizzly range across the continent sits at less than half what it once used to be. And while conservation efforts have helped buoy some grizzly populations over the last several decades, some places remain more deadly than others. Over the last seven years, young grizzlies in British Columbia's Elk Valley have faced the lowest survival rate recorded in North America, according to a new study published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice. Lead author Clayton Lamb, a wildlife scientist with Biodiversity Pathways and researcher at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, said roughly half of the young male grizzlies in the area were dying every year -- a combination of human conflict and collisions with a train, truck or car. These bears are dying at extraordinary high rates, said Lamb. For any one year it is like a coin flip if you are going to live. Elk Valley grizzlies were involved in a third of all road collisions in the province despite only making up 0.6 per cent of the province's grizzly population. And when it comes to rail collisions, nearly half the recorded mortalities occur in the Elk Valley, the study found. As a result, the researchers estimated government mortality databases are underreporting grizzly deaths by 65 per cent -- meaning that for every dead grizzly, two go uncounted. A ripple effect The high death rate for young grizzlies has meant habitat in the Elk Valley is regularly opened up for more young bears to move in. Grizzlies from as far away as Banff National Park in Canada and Glacier National Park in the YOU.S. find a valley rich in both food and humans. Known for massive coal mines, the Elk Valley is laced with busy highways and rail connections that weave through towns as they link Canadian provinces east of the Rockies with ports on the coast. It is here where Lamb and his team of biologists -- one from the provincial government, others from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature based in Kaslo, B.C. -- set out to understand why grizzlies were dying at such high rates and what was keeping the their population afloat. To find out, the research team captured 76 grizzly bears between 2016 and 2022, monitoring their behaviour, reproduction and survival using radio collars. While the bears roamed an area stretching seven kilometres into Alberta, most of their territory occupied a swath of the Rocky Mountains east of Cranbrook that contains five large open pit coal mines, and the towns of Elkwood, Sparwood and Fernie. The region is also an active recreational area, popular among off-road vehicles users, hunters, fishers and mountain bikers. Over seven years, they tracked 14 grizzly bear deaths -- six due to human-wildlife conflict, six involved in collisions with a vehicle or train, one which died of natural causes, and another whose death was suspected to be connected to a human. Lamb recalls the gruesome task of tracking down the young grizzlies after their radio collars stopped moving. They would be hit, and then they could make it a few hundred metres and I would find them dead, said Lamb. You know that the driver obviously knew they hit something but that as soon as that bear gets off the highway, it essentially does not exist from a data perspective. The province does not know about it. It just dies in the bush and nobody knows. Local bear population overwhelmed by high death rate Whether in a rail or road collision, Lamb estimates as few as one in five dead bears gets recorded. For a population of roughly 100 grizzly bears, Lamb says it is generally accepted that a mortality rate of roughly five per cent, or five bears, is sustainable. Road and rail deaths alone pushes the death rate to six per cent. Then there are deaths due to conflict with humans, which regularly doubles that death rate, meaning that without in-migration, seven more bears are dying every year than the population can sustain. Grizzlies from elsewhere have moved in, filling the habitat left empty by those dead bears. But a population that relies on migration raises serious questions over its long-term survival. We are always wondering, how sustainable is this on our end? Lamb said. For example, if some of the wilder areas around the valley, if they all of a sudden get developed and we build a coal mine there or we build new towns in these places, and we kind of reduce the pool that we are pulling dispersers in from -- maybe this currently sustainable dynamic, maybe it all collapses. Relying on migration to replace a fast-dying bear population could be a problem beyond B.C.'s grizzly dense Elk Valley. The more Lamb and his colleagues count dead grizzlies in somebody is front yard or on the side of the road, the higher chance their deaths could lead to a ripple effect that impacts the demographics of bears up to 100 kilometres away in places we think of as protected national parks. As Lamb put it: It is just this wicked spiral that we are in. Coexistence still a long way off In recent decades, a move to protect grizzly populations has often focused on reducing human-bear conflicts, either by locking away attractants or reducing the number of bears killed by hunters. From Yellowstone to the southern Canadian Rockies, conservation programs have allowed grizzlies to reclaim some of their lost historic range, which today sits at 55 per cent of its historic total. But even as grizzly populations rebound, humans have continued to expand their settlements, setting up a test as to whether people and bears can coexist. ?For Lamb, Elk Valley might be the deadliest place for grizzlies in B.C. But that fact also makes it an easy candidate for conservation. By focusing attention and dollars in one small area of the province, he says governments and locals could remove between a third and half of all grizzly road and rail collisions in all of B.C. There is a lot of bang for their buck investing in conservation solutions here, Lamb said. Despite at least 40 years of progress in advancing the protection of B.C.'s grizzly populations, Lamb says many communities have yet to switch to a coexistence mindset fast enough and are still not set up to live alongside large carnivores. More support needed for electric fencing, fruit tree removal Part of the gap is financial. Unlike Alberta or Montana, the B.C. government does not have dedicated coexistence programs to reduce the availability of attractants, namely garbage, livestock and fruit trees. Lamb said B.C. lacks a cost-sharing program that helps ranchers with electric fencing. Other residents, he said, may be convinced to remove a fruit tree in their backyard if there was better financial support. Glacier Media reached out repeatedly to multiple ministries for comment but had not heard back more than 48 hours past its initial deadline. When it comes to roadway deaths, Lamb says there is already a project that aims to set up electric fencing -- a proven deterrent for grizzlies -- along 27 of the valley's 100 kilometres of highway. The project, which is not finished and not fully funded, includes dedicated wildlife road crossings in what Lamb describes as a positive move forward. Railway collisions? Almost no progress, he said of negotiations with CP Rail, which recently rebranded as CPKC after buying out Kansas City Southern Railway in 2021. We really struggle working with the rail company. CPKC spokesperson Terry Cunha said the company has engaged with the Canadian government and other institutions concerning rail-related wildlife strikes. Actions we have taken include focusing efforts on vegetation management along the tracks in key areas through the mountains to reduce wildlife activity close to the railway, support wildlife sightlines and ensure room for animals to safely exit the tracks, Cunha said in an email. Bear-train collisions pose a complex problem, with no simple solution.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Over the last seven years, young grizzlies in British Columbia's Elk Valley have faced the lowest survival rate recorded in North America.

Houses built by NGOs and the locals are now left with only iron pillars. Maran Bauk Lar told Radio Free Asia. This was a type of bomb that has never been used in Myanmar. The explosion at the Mung Lai Hkyet internally displaced persons camp at about 11 p.m. on Monday killed 29 people, including 11 children, and left 57 others wounded, relief workers told RFA. The camp is near Lai Zar in the mountainous border area between Kachin state and China. Lai Zar is the headquarters of the Kachin Independence Army, or the KIA, which has fought the Burmese military for decades and controls areas of northern Myanmar. KIA information officer Col. Naw Bu told RFA earlier this week that he believed the junta was targeting the headquarters in the attack. Maran Bauk Lar said he was walking to his farm when he heard the explosion. When he returned, he found a deep pit and the remains of his sister-in-law and the other family members. My mother's body was completely dismembered, and her skull was broken, he said. Only the bones remain. My wife and children were killed under the collapsed building. Our dormitories were completely destroyed. There is nothing left. 'Emboldened by the indifference' The Mung Lai Hkyet camp has 658 residents, many of whom are now suffering from psychological trauma as they recover from the explosion, relief workers said. Survivors have been temporarily relocated to a church in Woichyai, an internally displaced persons camp in Lai Zar. At the moment, they are sleeping on the floor of the church, a person helping them said. They have to start a new life from scratch. They do not have a single penny in their hands.  The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of independent experts working to support human rights efforts in the country, urged the United Nations and its member states to hold the junta responsible for the attack. The Myanmar military is so emboldened by the indifference of the international community in response to its decades of atrocity crimes that it is now attacking camps for internally displaced people, said Yanghee Lee, a member of the council and a former YOU.N. Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. The military is flagrantly massacring the most vulnerable people in society, and yet YOU.N. entities in Myanmar will not even publicly name the military as the perpetrator, he said. At the State Department, spokesman Matthew Miller said that the United States was deeply concerned by reports of the explosion. We strongly condemn the military regime's ongoing attacks that have claimed thousands of lives since the February 2021 coup and continue to exacerbate the region's most severe humanitarian crisis, he said on Tuesday. 'The culture of military dictatorship' Fighting in the area between junta forces and the KIA has intensified since July. Lately, there have been artillery strikes from the junta almost every day, local residents said. While some residents said they heard a plane just before Monday's explosion, others told RFA that they heard nothing. The KIA has formed an investigation team to determine what caused the blast, Naw Bu said, adding that it may have been a bomb dropped by a junta-operated drone.

RFA's calls on Wednesday to Win Ye Tun, the junta's social affairs minister and spokesman for Kachin state, for comments on the death toll at Mung Lai Hkyet went unanswered. Junta spokesman Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun told RFA that junta troops were not behind the attack on Mung Lai Hkyet. He speculated that it was caused by an accidental explosion at a warehouse where the KIA stores gunpowder.

One of the busiest ports in Japan, the Port of Nagoya was reportedly forced to halt cargo loading operations in early July following a ransomware attack. Threat actors associated with Lockbit 3.0 claimed responsibility. While the port has since been able to recover operations, this event once again underscored that cybersecurity is at the core of maintaining secure maritime infrastructure and facilitating robust economic supply chains. From the typical IT business networks that facilitate administrative processes like any other industry, to the operational technology (OT) assets that handle the movement of cargo around the facility, the attack surface and significance of ports can represent an attractive target for a variety of bad actors. Ransomware Operations Today To better understand the Port of Nagoya cyberattack in context, it is important to first assess the current state of ransomware. The last several years have witnessed a growing spate of ransomware attacks across the globe that have disrupted and impacted virtually every sector. Since late 2019, an increasing number of these operations have been coupled with data theft and the threat to leak internal, often sensitive information to the public. This has given threat actors another vector to extort organizations beyond just the encryption of their data and systems, causing halts to workforce operations. Such leaked data on name and shame sites operated by extortion actors can spell brand and reputation damage for the victim organizations. Over the years the public success of these operations has attracted additional entrants into this criminal industry, who have facilitated and specialized in niche aspects from providing initial access to post-compromise exploitation to development of the ransomware itself. Often hackers will work with and switch between various Ransomware-as-a-Service providers and partners. Even nation state groups have seen the value offered by this disruptive and often deniable capability, with utilization of ransomware by suspected Russian, North Korea, and Iranian actors-among others and for differing reasons. Overall, while Mandiant responded to fewer investigations involving ransomware in 2022 than the year prior, this threat continues to be elevated. Cybersecurity and the Maritime Sector So why target ports? Broadly speaking, the two primary categories of adversaries that maritime infrastructure faces are criminal and state-sponsored threats. For criminal and financially motivated hackers, while data theft has increasingly become an attractive extortion tactic as discussed above, certain sectors are more sensitive to the actual shutdown caused by ransomware itself. For example, quarter after quarter, Mandiant has observed the manufacturing industry to be one of the most heavily targeted sectors by ransomware threat actors. Corporations in this sector are much more sensitive to any downtime caused by a loss of continuity of operations, and can often directly ascribe a monetary impact to these events. The same holds true for much of the transportation and maritime sectors as well. Even though many threat actors in the ransomware space are sector-agnostic in their targeting, some may have a tendency to pursue targets more who they believe have a greater incentive to recover operations. In looking at nation-state threats, perhaps one of the most significant cyberattacks on maritime infrastructure and ports was the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack. While not initially targeted at port infrastructure, the wormable capability of the malware expanded beyond initial targets in Ukraine to impact the operations of maritime giant Maersk, among others. Though it initially appeared to be ransomware, with no actual means for decryption it functioned more similar to a wiper malware in bricking the assets it impacted, and was ultimately attributed to Russia. Ports are not the only targets within the maritime sector at risk from state-sponsored hackers. In August 2022, Mandiant publicly uncovered a suspected Iranian cyber intrusion campaign targeting shipping entities among other industries. The assessment of the analysts who examined this campaign was that the purpose of the activity was likely espionage, especially as some of the targeted entities handled the shipping for sensitive components. This set of activity was also notable given some of the very public incidents of kinetic engagement between Iranian naval assets and commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. Using cyber espionage to potentially gaining access to information about shipping routes and planned travel could facilitate such operations and ultimately provided another notable case study as to how nation states might target the maritime sector. Anticipating Future Threats Regardless of the vector or intent, an important question to ponder is how the targeting of maritime infrastructure and ports may evolve given the many public incidents over the years, up to and including the Port of Nagoya cyberattack. Successful, public cyber operations-even those with limited impact-can beget further operations. Financially motivated criminals see opportunities to make money. State-sponsored groups might see ways to disable or disrupt key economic nodes under the plausible deniability of pretending to be criminal operations. In regions where the geopolitical environment is fraught with increased tensions-such as those faced by the neighbors of the cyber-capable and antagonistic North Korean state-preparation and a proactive security posture is paramount. How should security professionals at ports respond to current and future threats? First, segmenting and hardening networks from the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) most common to disruptive actors of any kind can make infrastructure more resilient. In particular, increasing the difficulty of a successful compromise by a threat actor into the IT infrastructure to move laterally into OT infrastructure is key. Having backups, and testing being able to restore from backups is also essential. Lastly, threat intelligence that is tracking both new and emerging threats as well as the campaigns from known actors, can be key to ensuring proactive defenses. Though there is sometimes the view that activity such as ransomware is more of a concern for organizations in the United States or Europe, as the Port of Nagoya cyberattack demonstrated, actors such as those behind Lockbit 3.0 can launch attacks against targets globally. As ports have an important role to play in the global economy, ensuring their security and continued operations is in the interests of all of us.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Port of Nagoya was reportedly forced to halt cargo loading operations in early July following a ransomware attack.

Kevin McCarthy. They are also dialing up the rhetoric against the GOP's new nominee for speaker, prominent Donald Trump ally Jim Jordan of Ohio, blasting him as an insurrectionist, election denier and extremist. House Republicans have selected as their nominee to be the speaker of the people's House the chairman of the chaos caucus, a defender in a dangerous way of dysfunction, and an extremist extraordinaire, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday on the steps of the Capitol, flanked by dozen of Democratic lawmakers. His focus has been on peddling lies and conspiracy theories and driving division amongst the American people. House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., labeled Jordan an insurrectionist and said he would be on a glide path to becoming speaker if not for the unified opposition of Democrats. He was directly involved in the right-wing coup that sought to overturn the 2020 election, she said, referring to Jordan and the 147 congressional Republicans who objected to certifying presidential election results on January 6, 2021. Every Republican who cast their vote for him is siding with an insurrectionist against our democracy, Clark said. The fiery comments represent an early marker from Democratic leaders about how they would seek to tie the GOP majority, particularly swing-district members they are targeting in 2024, to Jordan's brand if Republicans elect him speaker. I think moderate Republicans should be freaked out with Jim Jordan as speaker, said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., a member of Democratic leadership. He predicted that Jordan would push for a national abortion ban and impeach President Joe Biden. Lieu also warned that if Jordan is speaker, he would fight to avoid certifying a potential Biden re-election victory in 2024: Jim Jordan is one of the leaders of not respecting the will of American people in elections, and he will absolutely do everything he can to not certify a Biden victory. That is what he did before. Republican allies of Jordan defended him Friday, with Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., saying a bunch of us will help him get the votes to become speaker. Asked what Jordan can do to change minds, Armstrong said: Talk to people, listen to people. He is really good at it. Everybody sees the partisan brawler on TV because he is on message, he is an effective communicator, but he is the only guy that has the credibility with our base to do what we need to do and not get beat up. Jeffries said Democrats want a bipartisan path to reopening the House but did not outline what that would look like. Democrats unanimously nominated Jeffries to be speaker, but there is no chance of him winning when Republicans have a 221-212 majority. Still, Democrats say the onus is on the GOP to negotiate with them and make concessions if they want help electing a speaker. There are no serious discussions taking place on a coalition speaker picked with bipartisan votes, according to senior lawmakers and aides in both parties. No Republican has come to leadership to have a serious conversation of substance, said a senior Democratic aide. This is on Republicans to come to the Democrats to try to find a compromise. A quartet of centrist Democrats -- Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Susie Lee of Nevada, Ed Case of Hawaii, and Jared Golden of Maine -- sent a letter to temporary speaker Patrick McHenry supporting an enhancement of his powers, in 15-day increments, so that the House can conduct business while it is without an elected speaker. But that letter is unlikely to have much of an impact as McHenry lacks the ability to enhance his own power without a majority of the House voting to give him that authority. Many Republicans oppose that idea. They adjourned for the weekend after nominating Jordan in a 124-81 vote behind closed doors. On a second ballot, asking members if they could support Jordan on the House floor, he won 152 votes with 55 opposed. He will need 217 floor votes to win the job. With no immediate path to achieving that, Republicans adjourned the House for the weekend. Despite all the chaos in their ranks, conservative Republicans say they have no concern that some in their party may heed the calls by Democrats to join them and elect a bipartisan speaker. That is the thing that gets you beat in a primary, said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. You would get your a-- beat, said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, said those discussions have only happened outside the GOP conference, not among Republican lawmakers. People can talk a big game about that. I have not personally heard anybody talk about that; it is only hearsay, he said. But I think that is pretty nuclear. Let us keep this conventional. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., who chairs the Democrats' campaign arm, rejected Republican claims that Democrats are at fault for the predicament due to their votes to remove McCarthy. It is really appalling that they cannot even own their mess, she said. They have been unable to govern from the beginning of this Congress and unable to work with Democrats. All they seem focused on is fighting each other. When I have gone through battleground districts across the country, folks want to see governance work, DelBene said. All they have seen from the Republican side is chaos and dysfunction.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Democrats are blasting the GOP's new nominee for speaker, Jim Jordan of Ohio.

It will be steered westward over the next week. The system could threaten the Caribbean. Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. A tropical disturbance is making an unusually late voyage across the deep tropical Atlantic and it poses a threat to the Caribbean in a week or so. The disturbance, a tropical wave tagged Invest 94L by the National Hurricane Center, is located at a rather low latitude between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles. The wave is disorganized, but environmental conditions should improve by early next week. Formation is increasingly likely into next week as the wave gets closer to the Caribbean and it is currently given a high chance of development into a tropical depression or storm. The system will be moving westward across the main development region (MDR) through the next week due to a hefty Bermuda high locked into place to its north. Clockwise flow around the Bermuda High will push it toward the eastern Caribbean by the end of the upcoming week. The next named storm of the season will be Tammy. Tammy could form in an odd location, then take an odd path. The tropical Atlantic is the strip of ocean that stretches from Africa to the Caribbean south of 23.5 degrees north latitude. Named storms more commonly form in this region in the peak months of August and September. That is when water temperatures are most favorable for development in that region. They begin cooling off by late September and become too cool for tropical development by the end of the calendar year. This trajectory is also an odd one for the middle of October. Systems that form in the open Atlantic tend to curve northward or eastward away from the Caribbean or YOU.S. mainland as the jet stream begins to scoop such systems out of the tropics and carry them away. This is what has happened to 94L's predecessor, Tropical Storm Sean, which is expected to move northwestward while gradually unraveling. Westward tracks are not unheard of, however. Hurricane Tomas in 2010, 1999's Hurricane Jose, and 2014's Hurricane Joan were a few that took a similar track. Here are some more. Very few of these systems make it as far west as Jamaica. Caribbean impacts remain unknown. With nearly a week to go, there are still many things to figure out in this forecast. The strength of the system and its precise track are two of those things that will dictate what, if any, impacts may occur in the islands.

The extensive network is believed to be as much as 100ft (30m) beneath the surface in some places and makes up a central part of defences the terrorist group has spent years preparing. Tunnel entrances are hidden in the bottom floors of houses, mosques and schools, while the territory's narrow streets and alleyways are expected to have been laid with booby traps and homemade bombs in preparation for any Israeli attack. Hamas' preparations will mean any ground assault into northern Gaza will be fraught with danger and likely to cause heavy casualties on both sides, as well as the civilian residents who remain. The difficulties of clearing the defences will be increased by the potential use of human shields from the local population and even from among the scores of Israeli hostages seized at the weekend. Israeli officials have also alleged the group builds military bases near residential buildings and has also in the past hidden weapons in homes, or even schools and health facilities. Dr Daphn Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare at Reichman University in Israel, said the tunnels beneath Gaza were deeper and more sophisticated than cross-border passages used to sneak into Israeli territory. She told the BBC: The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence. The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand. Israel said it had already begun targeting the vast network as part of its bombing campaign in response to Saturday's unprecedented incursion. Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas: We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built, Jonathan Conricus an IDF spokesman, told a briefing on Thursday. These are not bunkers for Gazan civilians. It is only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel. Hamas started building tunnels in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops from the area almost two decades ago but ramped up the construction after both Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the area in 2007. After the last flare-up of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2021, the IDF claimed to have destroyed more than 60 miles of tunnels. Hamas, however, claimed at the time that only five per cent were damaged as it boasted that its underground infrastructure was at least 300 miles long, which makes it longer than the London Underground. The network, however, is out of bounds for civilians, and there are no underground shelters for residents in Gaza who have been living under constant airstrikes since Saturday. Even if the Israeli forces are able to clear the area, they will then have to decide whether to withdraw or to occupy the territory, which could take large numbers of troops. Sir Tom Beckett, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies - Middle East, said: If the IDF attempts to mount a garrison large enough to control Gaza while continuing to protect the country from threats emanating from the West Bank, southern Lebanon and Syria, its capacity will soon be stretched thinly.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Hamas has spent two decades building a labyrinth of deep, defensive tunnels to resist any ground assault by Israeli troops.

The Southeast Asian country, one of Israel's biggest sources of migrant labor, has had some of the highest casualties among foreign nationals in the Israel-Hamas war. The Thai Foreign Ministry said Thursday that 21 of its nationals had been killed and 14 wounded, while 16 others are believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Other countries from which large numbers of migrant workers go to Israel have also reported deaths. On Friday, as more than 250 citizens of Nepal arrived in Kathmandu on a special flight from Tel Aviv, the government said it was working to bring back the bodies of 10 agriculture students killed by Hamas at the kibbutz where they were staying under an Israeli government earn and learn program. Another is missing. The Philippines confirmed a third death Friday, all of them reportedly caregivers, and said three other nationals remained missing. Israel relies heavily on migrant workers like Suriya, 38, a married father of two from Thailand's Udon Thani province who works on a flower farm in Netanya, a city on the Mediterranean coast, about 20 miles north of Tel Aviv. He said the impact of the rockets Hamas fired toward Tel Aviv could be felt all the way in Netanya. I could feel the ground vibrating when I slept at night and that kept me awake and thinking about returning home, said Suriya, who arrived in Israel last year. Especially in the first two days when I watched the news, all I thought was, should I return home? Suriya has decided to stay put for now, as Netanya is more than 60 miles from the border with the Gaza Strip where most of the fighting has occurred, though even there he said he saw two rockets in the sky Thursday. Others have made a different call: He said a friend who lived closer to the attacks had asked his employer to help him buy a plane ticket home for about 700. Almost 6,000 of the 30,000 Thais in Israel have asked to be repatriated, according to Thailand's Foreign Ministry, which is arranging flights. A group of 19 Thais were scheduled to return home from Israel on Friday night local time, in addition to an initial group of 41 who arrived Thursday. The group that arrived in Bangkok on Thursday was met at the airport by multiple Cabinet ministers, and included two men injured in the violence who were in wheelchairs. Two others had sustained injuries on their arms. One of the men in the wheelchairs, Kratchakorn Putsorn, said that when the Hamas attack began Saturday, his employer hid him and other farmworkers on the property. They emerged for lunch around noon when the situation appeared to be calmer. But as they were returning, he said, they heard gunshots, and Kratchakorn felt something hit his knee. I thought it was a rock, but when I looked down I knew it was not a rock as it went through, he told reporters. So I told my friend to crouch because we were hit. As his employer tried to speed the truck away, Kratchakorn said, the terrorists continued chasing it and firing, hitting three other people. I thought on that day that we would not survive because they fired the bullets nonstop, he said. Migrant workers from Thailand, the Philippines and elsewhere go abroad in search of higher wages as farmworkers, caregivers and health care professionals, so that they can send money home to their families, boosting their countries' economies in the process. But they also face abuse and harsh working conditions, including in Israel where Thai farmworkers interviewed by Human Rights Watch have described being underpaid, working excessively long hours and other rights violations. Suriya said that if all Thai workers were to leave, it would have a noticeable impact on the Israeli labor force. Every farm I know, there are Thai workers, he said. We are very good at agricultural work and most farms here employ Thai workers mostly. Orna Sagiv, the Israeli ambassador to Thailand, said she met with Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Friday and that they were focused on assisting the Thai workers who had been affected by the war and supporting their families. To Israeli farmers, Thai workers are not just employees; they are an integral part of their family, she said in a post on X. Israel deeply values their hard work and acknowledges the significant role they play in the country's agriculture sector. Israel is also home to 30,000 people from the Philippines, many of whom work as caregivers. One of the Filipinos killed, a newly married caregiver who had been in Israel for six years, was shot with her employer inside their house on Saturday by Hamas gunmen, Philippine officials said. The woman, identified in the Philippine media as Angelyn Peralta Aguirre, 33, from Pangasinan, was praised by Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, for staying with her older patient. Despite having a chance to flee the Hamas terror attacks, Angeline showed unbelievable humanity and loyalty by remaining Nira's side during the violence, resulting in both of them being brutally murdered by Hamas, Hassan-Nahoum said in a post on X on Wednesday. Unimaginable honor in the face of evil. The Philippine Foreign Ministry said Friday that its repatriation efforts were now focused on Gaza, a densely populated enclave where there are fears Israel is about to launch a ground offensive. Among the 131 Filipino citizens there, 92 are asking for repatriation from Gaza, which has long been under a land, air and sea blockade enforced by Israel and Egypt. Far from the Gaza border, Suriya says he is relatively safe for the moment in Netanya, with the closest military target for Hamas being the Tel Aviv airport about 25 miles away. I will give it a week and if the situation is not getting better, I will then buy the plane ticket to go back on my own, he said. If that is the case, I think I will probably arrive in Thailand at the same time as those who have registered with the Thai government.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Thailand has had some of the highest casualties among foreign nationals in the Israel-Hamas war.

For months the trade union bureaucracy has sought to smoother opposition to the Tories with promises that a Labour government would soon come to the rescue of embattled workers. Nothing Starmer and his right-wing lackeys said has shifted the likes of Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers union General Secretary Mick Lynch, Communication Workers Union (CWU) Dave Ward and Unite's Sharon Graham to abandon this lie -- not the endorsement of Shadow Chancellor Rachael Reeves by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, not Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting saying Labour will not waste money we do not have on the National Health Service (NHS), and certainly not the numerous declarations of support for Israel's bloody repression of the Palestinians. Lynch and Ward instead doubled down on the relentless boosting of Labour they pioneered in their Enough is Enough campaign to oppose demands to link the struggles of rail, post, health workers and many others in a general strike to bring down the Tories. Likewise Graham, who once threatened to end Unite's funding and affiliation with Labour if it did not start representing workers. What passes for their criticism of Starmer as an individual is framed entirely as friendly advice to the leader of a government they will loyally support. And as far as their members are concerned, the message is that all roads lead to a Starmer government. Labour's naked pro-capitalist and pro-war agenda, wrapped up in the Union Jack and the invoking of country first nationalism, is a blueprint for deeper social spending cuts and a clampdown on strikes and democratic rights. Lynch at a fringe meeting of the the Trade Union Coordinating Committee was obliged to make some noises about how Labour has been embraced as the favoured party of big business, with corporate attendees outnumbering party delegates and afforded pride of place. But this was only while repeating the lie that Labour will implement a New Deal ending casualisation and low pay. His bluster was restricted to only those companies' at the conference directly associated with outsourcing, stating they should be called out for super-exploitation by Starmer and his deputy leader. Angela Rayner and Keir Starmer have said it in front of me and everyone else at this top tableWe're going to have the biggest wave of insourcing in the history of British industry. Well, that is exactly what we need because the outsourcing model is what is degrading our working-class communities. At another fringe meeting Lynch claimed that Starmer's Labour should not be backsliding over pledges to renationalise the national railways -- Labour should be shouting from the rooftops that the era of privatisation is over. He knows full well that the call for Starmer to sound the death knell for privatisation is a pipe dream. Policy and manifesto pledges count for nothing. The only constituency Labour is accountable to is the City of London. Reeves, who predictably dubbed herself the Iron Chancellor, ruled out nationalisations in July of the rail, water, postal and energy companies, stating, To be spending billions of pounds on nationalising things, that just does not stack up against our fiscal rules. Lynch speaks as someone who has driven the national rail dispute waged by 40,000 RMT members since last June into the ground. The first instalment of this came with a sellout deal imposed on 20,000 RMT members at Network Rail in March last year, followed by an agreement to suspend further strikes at the 14 train companies since early September on the pretext of awaiting the outcome of the public consultation over the closure of around 1,000 ticket offices which he himself described as a sham. The union executive had already signed a dispute resolution agreement in January, which was rejected by the membership because it accepted the entire framework for closing and repurposing ticket offices, inferior terms for new entrants and brutal restructuring. Ward, for his part, is a hate figure among CWU members thanks to the betrayal he inflicted on the year-long dispute by over 100,000 workers at Royal Mail in July. Barely able to show his face before the membership, he still had the gall to move the motion at conference on what was described as the flagship New Deal policy -- more window dressing for deepening the pro-company collusion of the union bureaucracy against the working class. The same fire and rehire measures the New Deal is supposed to end are being policed by the CWU in its agreement with Royal Mail. A central feature of what workers have dubbed the surrender document is the implementation of a two-tier workforce with new entrants on inferior pay and terms, with long serving postal workers forced out by crippling workloads and management bullying. Ward's speech won a standing ovation from the party faithful, who at best know nothing and at worst do not care about his betrayals. But as soon as the video was posted on the CWU Facebook page it met with instant derision from postal workers, with one dubbing him Dave Fraud. Ward appealed to Starmer to take a leaf out of the book of Joe Biden and show up at a picket line. His attempt to spread the US trade union bureaucracy's lie that Biden is the most pro-Labor US President in history is a warning about how Ward and company will function as apologists for every rotten action by a labour government. The White House has used collective bargaining with the union apparatus to strangle strikes and to enforce substandard contracts in the oil industry, ports and at major logistics giant, UPS. And when this has failed, the workers friend Biden and his left apologists such as Alaxandria Ocasio-Cortez did not hesitate in banning a strike by 100,000 railroad workers last year. Biden's solitary visit to a picket line was to back the United Auto Workers (UAW) bureaucracy vetoing the 97 percent mandate for strike action by 150,000 workers at the Big Three car manufacturers -- GM, Ford and Stellantis. This has kept 80 percent of car workers on the job four weeks into the dispute, pumping out profits while the UAW negotiate behind closed doors how to sellout the fight to reverse decades of attacks. It is this full integration of the unions into the apparatus of the state and corporate management to discipline workers and facilitate Biden's war against Russia and blood curdling support for Israel that Ward wants to emulate with Starmer. Graham's performance was made up of more hackneyed phrases about holding Starmer's feet to the fire. But this has not stood in the way of Graham continuing to bankroll Labour from her members' dues to the tune of more than 1 million in the first quarter of 2023. In a speech before conference Graham declared the big question for the next government is who pays for the crisis? Because it cannot be everyday working men and women who paid for the last. But since winning office in August 2020, she has made sure that her own members have already paid the price. With a membership of over a million in the private and public sector, Graham has performed the role of chief industrial fire fighter in preventing strikes on the buses, in warehouse and supply chains, local government and the docks from merging into a national action. Graham cynically urged Labour to be more bold and place its arms around the working class. This after Labour-run Coventry council last year mounted a 4 million scabbing operation against a strike by its refuse drivers. Graham agreed a de-escalation of the dispute through ACAS, which naturally ruled in favour of the council. The union bureaucracy has presided over the sabotage of the largest strike wave in the UK since the 1980s, with the last remaining national disputes in the NHS and on the rail facing sellouts. This betrayal is now being transferred to the political arena with the attempts by Lynch, Ward, Graham et al to hand the working class over to Starmer as Labour seeks to outflank the Tories in its commitment to austerity and war. The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) opposed the propaganda of pseudo-left groups such as Socialist Party and Socialist Workers Party that a rebirth of the British labour movement was being led by the trade unions and issued the call for the formation of rank-and-file committees to open an independent path of industrial and political struggle. As has been the case with the resurgence of the class struggle internationally, the strivings by the working class to unshackle its tremendous social power has brought it into direct conflict with the bureaucratic agents of capital committed to the suppression of the class struggle and defence of the capitalist profit system. The SEP initiative has won significant support through the formation of the Postal Workers Rank-and-File Committee. But this must now be extended throughout the working class, coupled with a political break from Labour and the building of genuine socialist leadership.

The American College of Emergency Physicians in a statement called the paper outdated and said the term excited delirium should not be used by members who testify in civil or criminal cases. The group's directors voted on the matter Thursday in Philadelphia. This means if someone dies while being restrained in custody ... people cannot point to excited delirium as the reason and cannot point to ACEP's endorsement of the concept to bolster their case, said Dr. Brooks Walsh, a Connecticut emergency doctor who pushed the organization to strengthen its stance. Earlier this week, California became the first state to bar the use of excited delirium and related terms as a because of death in autopsies. The legislation, signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, also prohibits police officers from using it in reports to describe people's behavior. In March, the National Association of Medical Examiners took a stand against the term, saying it should not be listed as a because of death. Other medical groups, including the American Medical Association, had previously rejected excited delirium as a diagnosis. Critics have called it unscientific and rooted in racism. The emergency physicians' 2009 report said excited delirium's symptoms included unusual strength, pain tolerance and bizarre behavior and called the condition potentially life-threatening. The document reinforced and codified racial stereotypes, Walsh said. The 14-year-old publication has shaped police training and still figures in police custody death cases, many involving Black men who died after being restrained by police. Attorneys defending officers have cited the paper to admit testimony on excited delirium, said Joanna Naples-Mitchell, an attorney and research adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, which produced a report last year on the diagnosis and deaths in police custody. In 2021, the emergency physicians' paper was cited in the New York attorney general's report on the investigation into the death of Daniel Prude, a 41-year-old Black man. A grand jury rejected charges against police officers in that case. Excited delirium came up during the 2021 trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was later convicted in the death of George Floyd. This fall, the term resurfaced during the ongoing trials of police officers charged in the deaths of Elijah McClain in Colorado and Manuel Ellis in Washington state. Floyd, McClain and Ellis were Black men who died after being restrained by police. The emergency physicians group had distanced itself from the term previously, but it had stopped short of withdrawing its support for the 2009 paper. This is why we pushed to put out a stronger statement explicitly disavowing that paper, Naples-Mitchell said.

Noting that there has been no direct impact on physical oil supplies from the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, the IEA said it expects the international community to remain laser-focused on risks to the region's oil flows if there are any signs that it could spill over politically to the wider Middle East. The IEA will continue to monitor the oil market closely and, as ever, stands ready to act if necessary to ensure markets remain adequately supplied, the IEA said in its latest monthly oil market report. ...While the prospect that oil supply flows will be impacted currently remains limited, the deadly strikes prompted traders to price in a higher geopolitical risk premium. Market watchers have speculated that oil supplies from Iran could be hit if the US tightens sanctions on Tehran over its backing of the Hamas and Hizbollah militants currently in conflict with Israel. The Paris-based energy watchdog has a key role in coordinating the release of emergency oil stocks with each IEA member country obligated to hold oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports and to be ready to collectively respond to severe supply disruptions affecting the global oil market. The IEA left its forecast for world oil supply in 2023 largely unchanged on the month at a record 101.6 million bd, adding that -- barring any unforeseen disruptions -- it is expected to average around 101.3 million bd in the fourth quarter of the year. Non-OPEC is still expected to dominate the projected annual supply gains this year of 1.5 million bd in 2023, it said. In 2024, the IEA also confirmed its previous estimate of 103.3 million bd. Demand destruction On demand, the IEA cut its 2024 global estimate by 76,000 bd from its previous forecasts to 102.7 million bd, as higher prices and a shift to working from home in key consuming countries such as the US have helped to soften the demand outlook. Citing a recent study from European think tank EconPol, the IEA said the rise of post-pandemic working from home means 500,000 bd of fuel use is being avoided in the US alone. The IEA said 2023 will likely be the last year of US demand growth before a decline of 220,000 bd sets in next year, when US gasoline consumption is forecast to decrease by 180,000 bd amid structural efficiency gains and a harsher economic climate. Demand destruction has hit emerging markets even harder, the IEA said, as currency effects and the removal of subsidies amplify a rise in fuel prices. There has been some evidence of large-scale demand destruction, especially in lower-income countries, like Nigeria, Pakistan and Egypt, and signs of accelerating declines within some OECD markets including the United States. These have been particularly centered on gasoline, with Nigeria seeing the latest and most abrupt response to sharply higher prices, the IEA said. Nevertheless, global oil demand is forecast to continue its strong growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, the IEA said, underpinning an annual increase of 2.3 million bd to 101.9 million bd for 2023 as a whole. China and non-OECD economies account for 77 and 97 of the increase, respectively. Oil demand growth continues to be led by jet fuelkerosene and petrochemical feedstocks. Next year, global oil demand is still expected to decelerate to 880,000 bd, as a harsher economic climate and continued progress in energy efficiency weigh on oil consumption, the IEA said. Stocks shrinking On stocks, the IEA said global observed oil inventories shrank by 63.9 million barrels in August to a 10-month low, led by a massive 102.3-million-barrel draw in crude oil stocks. Oil on water declined by 40.6 million barrels, while OECD and non-OECD stocks fell by 3.5 million barrels and 19.7 million barrels, respectively. OECD industry stocks fell counter-seasonally by 6.5 million barrels in August to 2.816 billion barrels, the IEA said, some 105.3 million barrels below the five-year average. The IEA also said preliminary data shows that on-land inventories continued to draw in September, mainly in non-OECD countries, while oil on water rebounded as exports recovered. Voluntary output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia are expected to keep the oil market in deficit as OPEC could pump 1.3 million bd below the call on its crude in the fourth quarter, the IEA said. If extra cuts are unwound in January, the balance could shift to surplus, which would go some way to help replenish depleted inventories, the IEA said.

If they are being criminally charged, there is no place for them in this organization, the sheriff continued. How can we have anyone out here wearing a badge that is stealing from the American people?

The scheme was uncovered after the sheriff's office's Public Corruption Unit received a tip from an employee that several workers may have committed PPP loan fraud, Tony said. He then instructed the unit to investigate the agency's roughly 5,500 employees, he said at the news conference. The accused workers include eight from the Department of Law Enforcement, including one sergeant, eight detention deputies and one sergeant from the Department of Detention, Sheriff Tony said, according to the sheriff.

The attack was being investigated as potential terrorism amid soaring global tensions over the war between Israel and Hamas. It also happened almost three years after another teacher, Samuel Paty. was beheaded by a radicalized Chechen near a Paris area school. French anti-terror prosecutors were leading the investigation into the stabbings at the Gambetta-Carnot school, which enrolls students ages 11-18 and is located in the city of Arras, some 115 miles north of Paris. President Emmanuel Macron, who visited the school hours after the attack, said the victim stepped in and probably saved many lives. Macron also said that police thwarted an attempted attack in another French region after the teacher's fatal stabbing. The president did not provide details, but police said a man armed with a knife was arrested coming out of a prayer hall in the Yvelines region west of Paris. The man's motives were not immediately clear, police said. The suspected assailant in Arras was arrested. The National Police force identified him as a Russian national of Chechen origin who was born in 2003. The French intelligence services told The Associated Press the man had been closely watched since the summer with tails and telephone surveillance and was stopped as recently as Thursday for a police check that found no wrongdoing. Sliman Hamzi, a police officer who was one of the first on the scene said the suspected attacker, a former student at the school, shouted Allahu akbar, or God is great in Arabic. Hamzi said he was alerted by another officer, rushed to the school and saw a male victim lying on the ground outside the school and the attacker being taken away. Colleagues arrived quickly but unfortunately could not save the victim, Hamzi said. He said the victim had his throat slit. I am extremely shocked by what I saw, the officer said. It was a horrible thing to see this poor man who was killed on the job by a lunatic. Police said two other men, a second teacher and a security guard, were in critical condition. Macron traveled to Arras along with the interior and education ministers. Macron stopped for a moment before the blanket-covered body of the teacher, which was in the parking lot in front of the school. A puddle of blood was visible as forensic experts worked around the body. Macron then went to see students from the school in an adjacent building. School attacks are rare in France, and the government asked authorities to heighten vigilance at all schools across the country. Julie Duhamel, an official with the Unsa teachers' union in the Pas-de-Calais region that includes Arras, told Franceinfo that teachers had noted the suspect's radicalization a few years ago. The suspected assailant's telephone conversations in recent days gave no indication of an impending attack, leading intelligence officers to conclude that the assailant decided suddenly on Friday to act, intelligence services told the AP. The suspect's brother was arrested in the summer of 2019 by the DGSI -- France's counter-terrorism intelligence service -- on suspicion of being involved in planning of attack that was thwarted and is in jail, French intelligence said. Police said another brother was taken into custody for questioning on Friday. Hundreds of police deployed around the school and nearby neighborhoods, including heavily armed units, and barricaded a wide perimeter around the school after the attack. Friday's attack had echoes of Paty's slaying on Oct 16, 2020 -- also a Friday -- by an 18-year-old who had become radicalized. Like the suspect in Friday's stabbings, the attacker had a Chechen background. Martin Doussau, a philosophy teacher at Gambetta-Carnot, said the assailant was armed with two knives and appeared to be hunting specifically for a history teacher. Paty taught history and geography. I was chased by the attacker, who ... asked me if I teach history. (He said), 'Are you a history teacher, are you a history teacher?' said Doussau, who recounted how he barricaded himself behind a door until police used a stun gun to subdue the attacker. When he turned around and asked me if I am a history teacher, I immediately thought of Samuel Paty, Doussau told reporters. Prosecutors said they were considering charges of terror-related murder and attempted murder against the suspect. The attack came amid heightened tensions around the world over Hamas' attack on southern Israel and Israel's blistering military response, which have killed hundreds of civilians on both sides. France is estimated to have the world's third-largest Jewish population after Israel and the YOU.S., as well as the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. French Interior Minister Grald Darmanin on Thursday ordered local authorities to ban all pro-Palestinian demonstrations amid a rise in antisemitic acts since last Saturday's attack by Hamas militants and the Israeli military's subsequent bombardment and siege of Gaza. France's National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, held a minute of silence for the victims at the opening of its Friday session. Macron said the school in Arras would reopen as soon as Saturday morning. The choice has been made not to give in to terror, he said. We must not let anything divide us, and we must remember that schools and the transmission of knowledge are at the heart of this fight against ignorance.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Man of Chechen origin stabbed a teacher to death at his former high school.

Mahmud Hams  AFP via Getty Images file Videos published online that Hamas says are its terrorists committing violent acts during the recent attack on Israel have spread across the app X and the messaging app Telegram, with many remaining online for hours and sometimes days. On X, some videos created by Hamas and the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, have been shared by some verified accounts and have accrued millions of views, according to a review by NBC News. Hamas videos were also viewable on Telegram, which is based in Dubai and has few rules about the content that users post. Users who have posted the videos on X often say they are reposting official Hamas content from the group's attack on Israel. On Telegram, videos from the official Qassam Brigades account are labeled as first-person footage from terrorists who were part of the attack. When asked for comment, X sent an automated email saying Busy now, please check back later. Telegram did not respond. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said Friday in a post on the app that the company removes millions of obviously harmful content from our public platform, but that it also sees some value and responsibility in being an avenue for war-related content even if some of it is produced by terrorist organizations. Unlike other apps that algorithmically promote shocking content to unsuspecting people, on Telegram, users receive only the content to which they specifically subscribed, he added. As such, it is unlikely that Telegram channels can be used to significantly amplify propaganda. Instead, they serve as a unique source of first-hand information for researchers, journalists, and fact-checkers. NBC News was unable to find such overt violent, branded videos on other major tech platforms, though footage from the war remains pervasive. Adam Hadley, executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a nonprofit group that helps tech platforms moderate branded terrorism content from groups officially designated as terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union, said he was disappointed in the tech companies' responses. What we have found over the past week is that a number of platforms have done nothing, he said. And we are talking about officially branded material. Platforms have for many years had special rules regarding content produced by terrorist organizations. About a decade ago, tech companies began to more aggressively moderate their platforms after the Islamic State terrorist group began publishing violent propaganda videos. Under the leadership of Elon Musk, who bought X last year, the company has cut back on its moderation teams that policed the platform for content that violated its policies. The company also changed the definition of a verified user from a person the company has authenticated to a person who pays a monthly fee for a premium subscription. Those users get priority placement in other users' feeds and in search results, and can monetize their accounts if they reach enough people. The nonprofit Tech Transparency Project, which aims to create accountability for tech companies, released a report Thursday highlighting Hamas content on X. It found four verified accounts that have shared branded Hamas content purportedly from the invasion. NBC News verified that those videos are all still visible on X. That is particularly concerning with content like this because it is essentially paying to get algorithmically promoted Hamas videos ranked higher in search, said Katie Paul, the organization's director. The European Commission, the enforcement arm of the E.YOU., has warned X that allowing terrorism videos to proliferate on major websites runs afoul of the bloc's regulations. X CEO Linda Yaccarino told the E.YOU. in an open letter Wednesday that we have taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content. Shortly after the news broke about the Hamas attack, X assembled a leadership group to assess the situation. In crisis situations, X's unique purpose to serve the public conversation; access and share information, raise awareness about the situations they are in and on the ground, and openly and freely exchange on issues becomes all the more critical, she wrote. The Commission announced Thursday that it was escalating its inquiry into X and could impose fines. Terrorist and extremist content have also long proliferated on Telegram. The app is often the first place that footage from terrorist acts and war zones is uploaded before spreading to other sites like X. The Qassam Brigades maintains an active Telegram channel with more than 600,000 subscribers. Videos that purport to be from the invasion over the weekend, including footage of killed and captured Israelis, are live on the channel. Yasmin Green, CEO of Jigsaw, a Google-owned organization that designs tech programs to counter societal platforms -- including ones to automatically flag content from particular terrorist groups -- said she worried the Hamas videos could inspire further acts of violence. They echo how ISIS used videos of violence for recruitment almost a decade also, she said. That group also primarily used Telegram and Twitter. We are about to witness a phenomenal wave of radicalization, she said. The incitement to violence is really concerning. I will not be surprised when I see it in the Hamas case, because I already learned the lesson from the ISIS case that egregious violence can be a recruitment asset for terrorist groups.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Some videos created by Hamas and the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, have been shared by some verified accounts on X.

Our information indicates that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on a call. It is unclear exactly how much materiel and munitions each container holds, but photos released Friday indicate the vessels are full-sized shipping containers of the type often seen on rail cars or cargo ships. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, added Kirby, using the official acronym for North Korea. US intelligence indicated some of the equipment began its journey in the North Korean port of Najin on Sept. 7 and arrived in the Russian coastal city of Dunay five days later. It was then transported by train across Russia before arriving at an ammunition depot near Tikhorestsk -- fewer than 300 miles east of the Crimean Peninsula -- on October 1. These arms transfers directly violate a series of UN Security Council resolutions, which is why we will continue to aggressively raise these arms deals at the UN alongside with our allies and partners, Kirby said. The burgeoning alliance among US adversaries is a worry for the Biden administration, with Kirby suggesting the North Korean assistance may be part of a quid pro quo. We also are increasingly concerned about Russian assistance to the DPRK in return for support, Kirby said. We assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic-missile production equipment or other materials and other advanced technologies. US intelligence assets are monitoring closely whether Moscow will provide Pyongyang with these materials, the NSC spokesman said. We have already observed that Russian ships are offloading containers in the DPRK, which may constitute the initial deliveries of material from Russia, Kirby said. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines both regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime. We will keep working to identify, expose and counter Russia's attempts to acquire military equipment from the DPRK and any state that is prepared to support its war on Ukraine.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions.

Even these low levels will probably increase in the next couple of weeks, said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team. That is typical for flu seasons, which tend to ramp up by December and peak in February. Budd said that the agency is not detecting the unusually early rise in flu activity that occurred last year, when kids and teenagers were hit especially hard. Most of the flu cases reported so far this season are influenza type A, specifically the H1N1 strain. A CDC report released Thursday found that children were disproportionately impacted by the flu last year. One of the study's authors, Danielle Iuliano, also a senior research epidemiologist at the CDC, said that the numbers of flu-related pediatric doctors' visits and hospitalizations were higher during the 2022-23 flu season than in previous years. Nearly all of those cases were flu type A, mostly H3N2. Just under 20 were classified as H1N1. Given what we saw last year, Iuliano said, vaccinating kids is really important to prevent them from getting sick, prevent them from being hospitalized and having the most severe outcomes. Doctors recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu shot, and say that now is the time to make that appointment. I tell my patients to get vaccinated by Halloween, said Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic. It takes at least two weeks after getting the shot to make antibodies for the maximum possible protection. We want to make sure everybody is protected before the holiday season, and that starts with Thanksgiving, Englund said. Three bugs are likely to circulate this winter: flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). There are early signs that those viruses are already spreading, though at relatively low levels, according to WastewaterSCAN. The group receives data from wastewater collection sites in 36 states three times a week, looking for evidence of viruses she would in sewage. We have started to see some increases in the rate at which we are detecting flu across the country as well as RSV, said Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. A late summer uptick in Covid seems to have peaked, Wolfe said. But those levels are still quite a bit higher on average right now than they were in the middle of the summer, Wolfe said. Still, doctors urge people to do what they can to keep viral activity down as the YOU.S. heads into cold and flu season -- including masking in some cases. Updated Covid shots and a new vaccine protecting pregnant women and older adults against RSV are available. In anticipation of increases of Covid, RSV and the flu, the Cleveland Clinic will begin requesting that everyone visiting hospitalized patients wear a mask starting next week. It is not a mandate, however. People come here to get better, and not necessarily to get exposed to something new, Englund said. They certainly do not need to be getting sicker from a visitor or a caregiver who might have any of these respiratory viruses.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Flu cases are low nationwide, but there are early signs that the virus is beginning to spread.

Tim Scott has let rip with a series of attacks against President Joe Biden and some of his Republican presidential opponents this week, a sharp turn from his typical campaign posture in the wake of Hamas' terrorist attacks in Israel. Scott's most aggressive attacks have been reserved for Democrats, a common target for him -- but usually at a different level. Scott accused Biden of having blood on his hands and suggested the president was complicit in the Hamas assault. His weakness invited the attack, his cash giveaways to Iran helped fund terrorism, Scott said during a speech Tuesday at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., referring to the administration's agreeing to unfreeze 6 billion in Iranian oil money this year as part of an exchange for American prisoners. Iran had not yet been able to access any of the money, which is in a monitored account and was restricted for humanitarian use, and the YOU.S. and Qatar agreed in the wake of Hamas' attacks in Israel to re-freeze the funds, NBC News reported Thursday. Christale Spain, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said in a statement to NBC News that Scott is employing harsh rhetoric to distract from his own inexperience. While President Biden is supporting our allies and leading on the world stage in the wake of the horrific attack on Israel, Tim Scott is desperately trying to distract from his lack of foreign policy creds and failure to deliver for the thousands of American service members at South Carolina's eight military bases and across the world, Spain said. In his speech Tuesday, Scott said: We need a president who is loyal to our allies, yet lethal to our adversaries because weakness has never purchased peace. Being passive is a provocation. Scott has also blown up at far-left Democrats, who he said have become incredibly hostile to the state of Israel. He called out each congressional member of the progressive Squad by name in his speech and called for any Democrat affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America to be expelled from Congress. It is a far cry from Scott's recent answer to a question in Mason City, Iowa, from a voter who wondered if his perception as a really nice guy would weaken America on the global stage. I am a nice guy, Scott said in response. I will say though, that I am not an angry guy. I think sometimes we confuse anger with strength. The South Carolina senator has aimed to distinguish himself from other 2024 candidates and emerge as a leader on Israel, highlighting his current work on both the Senate foreign relations and banking committees, and past work on the Armed Services committee. Scott has said he plans to introduce legislation that would refreeze Iranian assets currently being held in Qatar, and called for the Senate Banking Committee to hold a hearing with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and for an investigation into the release of the 6 billion to Iran -- all of which highlight his ability as the only member of Congress in the GOP primary field to legislatively respond to the attack. In a field of folks like this, he is the one that has the experience and the knowledge to lead right now, show strength, and actually deliver, senior campaign spokesman Nathan Brand told NBC News. But Scott's messaging in recent days has gone beyond highlighting his foreign policy chops. Scott's combative rhetoric has cast Biden as passive -- reframing a criticism Scott himself has faced. Hamas, attacking Israel, is undeniably the personification of evil. People want to call it a conflict, people want to call it a war, people want to call it good people on both sides. Hogwash. This is an act of evil, Scott said Monday at a gathering of faith leaders in South Carolina organized by his campaign. Scott offered a prayer to the audience of churchgoers that strayed from the often optimistic tone of his scripture-laced speeches on the campaign trail, praying not just for peace in Israel, but also for the full force of God's wrath. I pray for the Romans 13:4, Lord, Scott said. That you establish a government and make ministers within the government for justice and for wrath. Give them swords. Scott's angrier tone has honed in on Republicans, too. Scott on Thursday called former President Donald Trump just wrong for comments Trump made that were critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We cannot extend a single message to any of the enemies of Israel, that anyone in leadership stands against, or in opposition to, or questions the leadership of, the prime minister, Scott told reporters in Newton, Iowa. In his speech at the Hudson Institute, Scott popped off at both Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, both GOP primary rivals. Vivek Ramaswamy has said that the definition of success is reducing America's support for Israel, Scott said. Governor DeSantis once dismissed Russia's invasion of Ukraine as just a territorial dispute. The last thing we need is a Joe Biden Republican Party wing on foreign policy. Scott has acknowledged his shift in tone in the days after the attack. I am positive, Scott said at the Monday gathering of faith leaders. I am also positive that God is God of love and justice. And sometimes if you want to prevent war, you want to prevent the loss of lives, you have to have the kind of response to it that tells the adversary, never again, and not on my watch.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"South Carolina Sen.

Human Rights Watch said that videos recorded in Lebanon and Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday showed airdropped white phosphorus artillery rounds -- an assessment that was vehemently denied by Israeli officials. The group said that its analysis was corroborated through two interviews with witnesses on the ground who described a distinctive garlic-like smell that is a signature of white phosphorus. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, The current accusation made against the IDF regarding the use of white phosphorus in Gaza is unequivocally false. The IDF has not deployed the use of such munitions. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not respond to a request for comment. NBC News, which did not have reporters present when the strikes occurred in Gaza and Lebanon, has not been able to independently verify Human Rights Watch claims. White phosphorus munitions can potentially because burns and irritation, liver, kidney, heart, lung, or bone damage, and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. International law allows for certain uses of white phosphorus, such as creating smoke screens or generating light, but human rights groups say that the deployment of white phosphorus in areas where it could harm civilians or via airdrop is prohibited by international human rights laws. NBC News has not confirmed if any civilians were in the areas where white phosphorus was allegedly used. Gaza is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Israel has not signed and is not bound by the United Nations convention on the use of white phosphorus. Human Rights Watch says that it previously documented the use of white phosphorus by Israel in military conflict in 2009, a claim that was also echoed by the International Red Cross. Israel said in 2013 it would no longer use white phosphorus except in limited circumstances, according to Human Rights Watch. The munitions used this week in Gaza and Lebanon, the group said, were airburst 155 mm artillery projectiles, which can shower large areas with white phosphorus. The use of white phosphorus in densely populated areas of Gaza violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life, Human Rights Watch said in its report. In an email, Brian Castner, the weapons investigator for Amnesty International's crisis team, agreed with Human Rights Watch's assessment that the strikes they cited involved the apparent uses of white phosphorus. Castner added that Amnesty International has been conducting its own investigation into Israel's alleged use of white phosphorus, saying, We have verified that Israeli artillery forces striking Gaza are equipped with M825 and M825A1 155mm white phosphorus projectiles. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights told NBC News it was looking into the claims. In a Zoom interview, Palestinian surgeon Sara Al Saqqa, who works at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, said she had seen injuries this week that appeared consistent with white phosphorus wounds. There is certain types of weapons, the white phosphorus war crime injuries that is not even humanitarian to be used in wars. It is not allowed for anyone to use it. I have been seeing patients being injured with these type of injuries, Al Saqqa told NBC News. Those small shrapnels that just burn every single millimeter of their bodies, and like just cutting all the pieces of the depth of the bodies to parts, she added. Amhad Hasaballah, a Getty photojournalist, told NBC News that he photographed a barrage of strikes that hit Gaza City on October 11 that he believed to include white phosphorus smoke. Hasaballah has been photographing the region since 2015 and has previously won awards for his coverage of Israeli airstrikes. The photographs are now published and labeled online as depicting white phosphorus. The claim that white phosphorus was being used by Israel in this week's conflict has been circulating for several days online. On October 10, the official X account of the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates wrote, Israeli warplanes and artillery use internationally prohibitedwhitephosphorus, destroying AlKarama neighborhood in the northwest of Gaza City with a continuous series of airstrikes. The report comes as Israel appears to be preparing a ground assault on Gaza, warning more than 1 million people to leave the north of the densely populated enclave, which is roughly the size of Washington, D.C. At least 1,300 people have been killed in Israel since Hamas staged a series of surprise attacks on Saturday, the country's military has said. Nearly 1,800 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry, as Israel continues to bombard the area.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Human Rights Watch says videos show airdropped white phosphorus artillery rounds.

PAC-12 TEAM GREEN, read the bag's logo. Washington State coach Kyle Smith can see a little irony in that sort of thing. He and Oregon State's Wayne Tinkle are the only two men's basketball coaches left in the conference as of now for 2024-25, while their Pac-12 rivals will be flying back and forth across the country to play new sets of conference foes starting next season. Especially this league... the (talk about) carbon footprint and green energy? It is like 'You guys are full of it,' Smith said. You cannot put it any more blatant than that.

It is been well-documented that football-driven television money ultimately prompted the the departing schools' decisions to leave. While Arizona, ASU and Colorado will actually face somewhat comparable distances for Big 12 competition next season as they do now in the Pac-12, that is not the case for the other defectors. Except when they are playing among themselves, USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon will be heading to the Midwest or East for Big Ten competition. Located relatively central within the Pac-12 now, Utah will instead have to head further to the south or east for Big 12 games. And the Bay area schools will be leaving the Pacific coast to play games in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Maybe with a trip every other week. It is absurd, Smith said. The Stanford-Cal thing... is the silliest thing I have ever heard for basketball, he said. Smith said he hopes to someday welcome schools back to Pac, while Tinkle, like many of the league's coaches at the conference's men's basketball media day Wednesday, expressed sadness. You have got the people out there who say 'Screw them, they are leaving' but to me, it is just a shame, Tinkle says. We are losing some of the longest contested rivalries out there, but everybody's proven they are doing what is best for them. We just learned that lesson. The avalanche broke out on June 30, 2022, when UCLA coach Mick Cronin was playing a round of golf at the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club, where cellphones are not allowed. He learned right then that the Bruins and Trojans would be headed to the Big Ten in 2024. They literally drove a guy out to tell me. I would never seen a golf cart on that course, Cronin said. It did not surprise me. I am like the Grim Reaper. I was in the Big East (at Cincinnati) when it broke up. Got the job at UCLA and ... I am bad luck. After a full year of having UCLA and USC's decision hover over the league, Colorado announced it was heading to the Big 12 late last July. A week later, the Big Ten pulled in Oregon and Washington, prompting Utah, Arizona and ASU to head the Big 12 the next day. The Pac-12 was done, at least as it is currently known. When UCLA and USC left, it was like, 'Well, now what?' So it is kind of been a long year in that regard. Oregon coach Dana Altman said. Then Colorado left, which created more problems. There was always the threat of Arizona, Utah and everybody going to the Big 12. It was just an uneasy time for everybody. Part of me is really disappointed, because I like the league. I like the rivalries. It is been good for us. Cronin said he correctly predicted that football would lead the drive apart, though maybe not as quickly as it happened. But Cronin, Smith and Tinkle alike also expressed hope from football -- if it winds up going the route advocated in August by UCLA football coach Chip Kelly, who suggested top college football teams should go independent and leave the other sports to stay in more logical geographic rivalries. Cronin said it would happen, especially if the ACC falls apart to leave football with just three major power conferences, and people come to their senses regarding other sports. Look, they play six road games max in football, Cronin said. We play twice a week. We are traveling for MTEs (multi-team events), we are traveling all over the all over the country as it is. And when you start putting all these Olympic sports under those cross-country constraints and we talk about student-athlete all the time... At some point there is common sense. But right now, money is prevailing and it is survival. Cronin said he did not know when football might break off, but that it would once the lucrative NCAA basketball tournament was no longer run by the NCAA. If that day happens, then you can make decisions that are best for basketball, Cronin said. But can the Beavers and Cougars wait for that day? How long can they keep the Pac-12 banner alive, if at all? Some of that may be clearer after a legal fight plays out in Washington state, where WSU and OSU are seeking control of the Pac-12's remaining assets because of what they say is an existential threat to the conference. A preliminary injunction is set for November 14 while the San Jose Mercury News reported that the two sides -- OSUWSU and the 10 departees -- have also agreed to mediation to settle the dispute. If WSU and OSU can gain control of the Pac-12, they will have time to figure something out and without the departing members having a say. NCAA rules mandate that multi-sport conferences have at least seven teams playing men's basketball, though they allow a two-year grace period to build back to that number starting on the date that the withdrawal of schools puts them under the minimum. That means the Cougars and Beavers could hang on to the Pac name until 2026-27, giving them time to recruit Mountain West or other teams, possibly playing as an independent or as an affiliate of another conference until then. We are trying to find a way to just stay together and survive until some other (media) rights are up, Tinkle said. We want to make sure that we keep this brand going, the Pac-12. And it is not just for the financial -- it is for the AQ (automatic NCAA Tournament bid), it is for the football playoff. We are fighting for the Pac-12, and we are pissed off, quite frankly, that this thing is dissolved. But we cannot worry about how it happened. We have got to work together to find solutions. If we handle things the right way the next couple of years, things are going to settle back to maybe a little bit closer to the normalcy that we are used to. But for now, the tension still boils. The hosts of the Pac-12 media day main stage interviews mostly avoided the subject of the conference's future, some questions about the new conferences were discouraged or dismissed during breakout sessions, and commissioner George Kliavkoff did not even show up -- even though it has long been a tradition for the commissioner to address the media and field questions at preseason media days. But, no matter how ugly it gets, Smith says he will not be holding a grudge if some Pac-12 teams eventually return. Whenever, and however, they do. I would love to save the league and also be a home for when they want to come back, Smith said. When it settles out, when football goes on their own, hopefully we still have a Pac-12-whatever-name.

Emily Bregel Leaders of the Tohono O'odham Nation say they cannot and will not accept federal prosecutors' decision not to charge three Border Patrol agents who shot and killed a Tohono O'odham man in front of his home in May. The lack of charges in the fatal shooting of Raymond Mattia is a travesty of justice, Tohono O'odham Nation Chairman Verlon M. Jose and Vice Chairwoman Carla L.

The Nation's executive office will explore options to rectify this misguided decision, including seeking a congressional inquiry into the case, they said. We cannot and will not accept the YOU.S. Attorney's decision, Jose and Johnson said. We stand by the Mattia family, and all O'odham citizens in seeking justice. Members of the Tohono O'odham Nation should not have to worry that their lives could be randomly cut short by federal agents acting on Tohono O'odham sovereign land. Mattia died from multiple gunshot wounds, after 10 border agents and at least one Tohono O'odham tribal police officer came to his property the night of May 18. Immediately before agents opened fire, body-cam video released by YOU.S. Customs and Border Protection appeared to show Mattia reach into his jacket then quickly remove his hand in response to agents' commands. Mattia was unarmed at the time; moments earlier he had thrown a machete, still in its sheath, toward agents after they told him to put down what he was holding. On Friday, a spokesman for the YOU.S. Attorney's Office said the office stands by the decision not to bring charges. We stand by our conclusion, and we hear the Chairman's frustration, Zachry Stoebe, public affairs officer for the YOU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona, said in a Friday emailed statement. The YOU.S. Attorney's Office sent a letter to Chairman Jose on Sept. 20, the statement said, expressing condolences for the loss of the victim, describing the investigation and our conclusion, and also informing the Tohono O'odham Nation of the pending review by CBP's National Use of Force Review Board. We decline to comment more specifically on the meeting between the family and the department employees; victims have an inherent right to speak with the press, and to criticize their government, the statement said. The night Mattia was killed, tribal police had requested Border Patrol assistance in response to reports of gunfire in the area, according to CBP statements. Mattia's family said Mattia had called law enforcement himself to report border-crossers on his property, which is in a remote village near the YOU.S.-Mexico border, about 140 miles from Tucson. The family will likely file a civil lawsuit to get the answers that federal officials have refused to provide, Ryan Stitt, the San Diego-based attorney for the Mattia family, said Thursday. The Tohono O'odham Nation's tribal lands encompass both sides of the YOU.S.-Mexico border in Arizona and tribal members say they, and their traditions, have suffered under the increasing militarization of federal border enforcement efforts. For too long, the YOU.S. government's refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O'odham and other border communities, Jose and Johnson's statement said. While politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted and, in this case, killed by federal agents. This must stop. Contact reporter Emily Bregel at ebregeltucson.com. On X, formerly Twitter: EmilyBregel Tohono O'odham leaders' full statement The YOU.S. Attorney's decision to not press charges against YOU.S. Border Patrol agents in the tragic shooting death of Tohono O'odham member Raymond Mattia is a travesty of justice. The facts speak for themselves, and they do not support the YOU.S. Attorney's decision - Mr. Mattia was an unarmed man in his own front yard. Multiple agents made the decision to fire dozens of shots at short range at this unarmed man, hitting Raymond Mattia multiple times, and ultimately killing him. All of this was captured on agents' video cameras and is not in question. Where in America is a decision in defiance of such overwhelming evidence acceptable? Where in America is it okay for law enforcement officials, or anyone else, to take an unarmed man's life? We assume there is additional evidence beyond what is already in the public domain. At the very least there needs to be a trial so that the facts can be ascertained, and justice accomplished. There are countless questions left unanswered by this decision. As a result, we cannot and will not accept the YOU.S. Attorney's decision. On the contrary, we stand by the Mattia family, and all O'odham citizens in seeking justice. Members of the Tohono O'odham Nation should not have to worry that their lives could be randomly cut short by federal agents acting on Tohono O'odham sovereign land. In Mr. Mattia's case, he was not only on O'odham land, but at his own home, and defenseless. The Nation's Executive Office will explore other opportunities to rectify this misguided decision, which may include requesting Congressional inquiries. We also stand by other legal and administrative efforts to obtain justice for wrongly taking Raymond's life. For too long, the YOU.S. government's refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O'odham and other border communities.

The 911 calls were released to The Associated Press in response to a public record request. They cover a period from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on August 8 as the deadliest YOU.S. wildfire in more than a century, whipped by powerful winds from a passing hurricane, bore down on the town. At least 98 people were killed and more than 2,000 structures were destroyed, most of them homes, leveling a historic town that once served as the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom and a port for whaling ships. Many drivers became trapped on Front Street, surrounded on three sides by black smoke and a wall of flames. They had moments to choose whether to stay or jump into the ocean as cars exploded and burning debris fell around them. Hawaiian Electric, the state's electric utility company, has acknowledged its power lines started a wildfire on Maui, but faulted county firefighters for declaring the blaze contained and leaving the scene, only to have the flames rekindle nearby. The county and the families of some victims have sued Hawaiian Electric, saying the utility negligently failed to shut off power despite exceptionally high winds and dry conditions. The pleas for help came one right after another, people calling because they were stuck in cars on Front Street, trapped by fallen trees and power lines blocking evacuation routes or worried about loved ones who were home alone. Again and again, overwhelmed dispatchers apologized to callers but said there was no one available to send to their location, assuring them emergency responders were working to extinguish the fires. Dispatchers were also fielding emergency calls from outside of Lahaina, including reports of violent crimes and other wildfires burning in a different part of the island. They received more than 4,500 emergency calls and texts that day, according to the Maui Police Department, including hundreds of calls during the time span requested by the AP. Normally, Maui County dispatchers get about 1,600 calls a day. It was an extremely dynamic situation that day, in which our dispatchers adapted to the best of their abilities, Maui Police Department spokesperson Alana Pico wrote in an email. Roughly two-thirds of the known victims who died in the fire were 60 or older, according to a list from Maui County. The calls reflect the helplessness of the situation for those who needed help getting out quickly. In one call at 3:31 p.m., a woman said her daughter already called about an 88-year-old man who was left behind in their house and she wanted emergency personnel to know the sliding doors were unlocked. He would literally have to be carried out, she told the dispatcher. I just had to leave him because I had the rest of my family in the car.

Drescher, who serves as the president of SAG-AFTRA, representing more than 100,000 actors, said in an interview that airs Friday on the TODAY show, that and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, known as AMPTP, failed to counter union proposals regarding artificial intelligence protections and residuals from streaming. It really came as a shock to me because what does that exactly mean and why would you walk away from the table? It is not like we are asking for anything that is so outrageous, she said. It is so wrong. And it is so unfair. That they walked out of the meeting and so disrespectful. You know when I was there, I mean they talk at you. They really do not want to hear what you have to say or why you are saying it. The AMPTP did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. The alliance represents NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. Just hours before Drescher spoke out, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos addressed the stalled talks at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in California in which he said, We had very productive talks going, then what kind of happened last night. They introduced this levy on subscribers. It just felt like a bridge too far to add this deep into the negotiation. Sarandos said they had offered the actors a bonus if a show was successful on the streaming platforms, similar to one that was included in the recently ratified deal with writers. The AMPTP, which represents the studios and streamers said, in a statement earlier in the day that SAG-AFTRA's proposal would cost upwards of 800 million dollars annually. Drescher says, That is an inflated price for that benefit of the press. It factors out to 57 cents per year per subscriber, less than a postage stamp. She said that the AMPTP did not counter with another figure. The actors union went on strike in July, weeks after the writers did so. The Writers Guild of America strike ended almost five months later, on Sept. 27. Members of that union ratified its agreement this week. Drescher also said they are far apart on other key issues like raising the minimum wage for actors and protections on artificial intelligence. They refuse to increase that minimum so they can catch up with inflation, and not actually making real money less than they made in 2020, she said. We are fighting tooth and nail to get them the AI protections that they want. But the last thing that Sarandos said when they exited the room yesterday, 'We do not like your counter proposal for AI.' Well, you know, we are looking for the protections that these people deserve. Because it is their likeness. It is their essence of being. It is their talent that is in jeopardy of being ripped off. Adding, We are at a crossroads where it is a very dangerous time, she said. And this is a very important negotiation. What happens here matters. As for when talks will resume, Drescher says there is no meeting set and the union is willing to hold out. We cannot go back to the way things were, she said. It is unsustainable and my members can no longer make a living on this new and unprecedented streaming platform with the old structure of payment. And there are they are going to have to accept that reality.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Drescher, who serves as the president of SAG-AFTRA, representing more than 100,000 actors, said in an interview that airs Friday on the TODAY show, that and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, known as AMPTP, failed to counter union proposals regarding artificial intelligence protections and residuals from streaming.

Two officers assigned to the airport had arrived at an airport parking garage for their shift just after 11 p.m. when they found a few individuals breaking into another vehicle, Interim Philadelphia Police Commissioner John M. Stanford said in a briefing. At least two of the suspects then brought out guns and opened fire. One officer, 50, was struck multiple times in the upper torso while the other officer, 60, was hit in the arm, Stanford said. Both were transported to a nearby hospital. The 50-year-old was transported again to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m, Stanford said. The other officer was transported to Jefferson University Hospital, where he was in stable condition. Stanford did not name the officer who was killed but said he had served 22 years with the police force. The officer that was murdered tonight, he has one child, married with a child, and they are here at the hospital as you can imagine, heartbroken, devastated, that their family member is not coming home tonight, Stanford said. The injured officer also served 20 years with the police force. Stanford said there was one individual transported from the scene by a private vehicle to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where that individual was pronounced dead. We cannot confirm at this time whether or not that individual is involved. We do not know, it is a good possibility. Very similar to the suspect description. We are still investigating, he said. Stanford noted it is a difficult time for the department as three officers were shot last week. You can imagine what we feel, what this department is going through and quite frankly, how the city should be feeling to know that this has happened to two of the men that served them for 20 plus years, and ultimately one giving his life tonight for the city of Philadelphia, he said. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing. Stanford noted that one officer was in full uniform, the other in partial uniform, and it is unclear if the officers returned gunfire toward the suspects.

Raynaud's phenomenon, which causes parts of the body like the fingers and the toes to go cold and numb, likely stems from two genes, a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications found. The results of the study -- the largest genetic study of the condition to date -- could lead to more effective treatments, experts said. In people with Raynaud's phenomenon, cold temperatures or stress trigger spasms in the small blood vessels near the surface of the skin, causing the vessels to constrict and limit blood flow. The fingers and toes are most commonly affected, according to the Mayo Clinic. The skin will turn white or blue and then red when the attack ebbs. It gets painful and numb, said Dr. Marie Gerhard-Herman, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a staff physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital specializing in cardiovascular medicine. During an attack, people may not be able to move their hands as they want, added Gerhard-Herman, who was not involved with the new study. Dr. Laura Hummers, a rheumatologist and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that while medications for Raynaud's are available, they can have unwanted side effects. The main therapy currently is a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers, said Hummers, who was also not involved with the new research. Those therapies are fairly helpful. But they lower blood pressure, which can be a problem for otherwise healthy people, she said. And they can cause side effects, such as constipation, dizziness and headache, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Raynaud's occurs in 2 to 5 of the population, more commonly in women, and takes two forms. Primary Raynaud's is by far the most common and is typically diagnosed in teenage girls and women in their 20s, Gerhard-Herman said. Its symptoms are often manageable with lifestyle changes alone, such as avoiding cold and limiting stress. However, some patients' symptoms are so bothersome that they must use medication. The genes identified in the study are linked to primary Raynaud's. Secondary Raynaud's is rare and its symptoms can be more serious, including ulcers on fingers and gangrene, and medication is often necessary. It occurs in people with autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, which causes thickening and inflammation of the skin, and lupus, which causes inflammation throughout the body. Raynaud's runs in families and is heritable. About half the people who have primary Raynaud's phenomenon have another first-degree relative who also has Raynaud's, said Hummers, who co-directs John Hopkins Scleroderma Center. The new study explains why. Researchers in London and Berlin looked at data from more than 440,000 people in the UK Biobank, a massive database containing genetic and medical information.The team identified 5,147 cases of Raynaud's, 68 of which were primary Raynaud's. Another 439,294 records served as controls. We identify two distinct genes that point to two distinct mechanisms, said Maik Pietzner, one of the study's lead researchers and chair in health data modeling at Queen Mary University of London's Precision Healthcare University Research Institute. One gene variant affects how blood vessels narrow. People with this variant have a high number of a particular receptor for hormones that are released when the body is stressed or cold, he said. These hormones signal the tiny blood vessels in the skin to constrict, allowing blood to flow away from the extremities and to the body's vital organs. The other gene variant affects how blood vessels dilate, or relax, he said. The findings could hopefully lead to new treatments: Drugs could be developed that target this hormone receptor, for example, Pietzner said. One existing drug, an antidepressant called mirtazapine, already acts on the receptor and could possibly be repurposed for people with Raynaud's, he said. For patients, it is all about finding treatments, he said. While the two gene variants were linked to primary Raynaud's, not to the secondary form, any new drugs developed might help people with both, Hummers said. The researchers noted that the study had limitations. For example, they relied on diagnostic codes in people's electronic health records, which are not always reliable. As a result, some cases of Raynaud's may have been missed while others might have been misdiagnosed. In addition, the participants were all of European descent, and so the results cannot be generalized to all people. More studies are needed, the researchers wrote. They need to actually look at people with other ancestries, Gerhard-Herman said. Still, the large study is the first to identify the underlying genetics of the condition. The genetic studies that have been done in Raynaud's up until this point had not been as compelling as this one, Hummers said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Raynaud's phenomenon causes parts of the body like the fingers and the toes to go cold and numb.

All 23 coaches of the superfast train from Delhi's Anand Vihar Terminus to Assam's Kamakhya had derailed near Raghunathpur station, killing four people and leaving 71 injured. A 15-page joint note signed by the on-duty station master, points man, gateman, loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and track man has said that the accident may have been caused by a fault of the engineering department, the people said. The commissioner of railway safety (CRS), who is probing the accident, has recorded their statement, besides the injured passengers and locals. The issue was also discussed among the East Central Railway (ECR) officials at the accident site on Friday morning, they added. In their statement, gateman Nand Kishore Singh said that he saw sparking and heard heavy noise when the train was passing. Loco pilot Bipin Kumar Sinha said that when the train was crossing Raghunathpur home signal and a railway crossing he felt heavy vibration, jerk in the back portion of the locomotive and found pressure drop in the break pipe. If the loco pilot found pressure dropped during the running train, there is a possibility of one of the wheels getting down from the track leading to automatic break or a possibility of leakage in the brake pipe, said a senior official of the Indian Railway, who is part of the investigation team. He also said that 30 minutes before the incident, 15232 Down Durg-Barauni train, which was running on a changed route, passed on the same track and its loco pilot also felt vibration. In such a case, he has to inform the station manager about such vibrations and only an inquiry will reveal whether such information was shared with the station manager or not, said a railway official. Earlier on Thursday, two senior railways officials, on condition of anonymity, had said that the because of the derailment, according to a preliminary investigation, seemed to be a fault in the tracks, specifically a rail fracture, or a gap in the tracks. Meanwhile, a trial run was conducted on the affected railway tracks on Fiday, over 45 hours after the tragic railway accident. Several trains resumed operations on up line in the morning while the down line was restored for operation in the evening. Within 48 hours of the tragedy, train movement on up and down line was normalised.

The authorities are preparing a decree to restrict access to the area around the Inkoo LNG floating terminal, the Interior Ministry said on Friday, days after Finland's President Sauli Niinisto said that the damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline is likely to have been caused by external activity. Based on information from the Finnish Border Guard, Gasgrid Finland has given its expert assessment according to which the damage was not caused by the normal gas transmission process, the Finnish government said on Tuesday. Finland now plans to include the area around the Inkoo LNG floating terminal to the list of around 230 facilities of strategic importance in the country where access, travel, and stay are restricted. After the Balticconnector gas pipeline was shut down due to the leak, Finland's gas grid operator said that the state of the Finnish gas system is stable, and the supply of gas is secured via Inkoo LNG floating terminal. Finland set up the Inkoo LNG floating terminal under a deal for a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel between Gasgrid Finland Oy and YOU.S. firm Excelerate Energy in May 2022, days after Russia cut off pipeline gas supply to Finland. The suspected external activity on the Finland-Estonia pipeline, a year after the sabotage on Nord Stream, has prompted Finland and its Nordic neighbors to increased security measures and patrols at critical energy infrastructure.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman to discuss the fallout from Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, especially repercussions in the occupied West Bank. The secretary's trip to Jordan, located along much of Israel's eastern border, comes after Blinken spent time meeting with Israeli officials as well as people directly impacted by the attack and war, which has killed more than 1,300 Israelis and at least 27 Americans. Blinken also met with Jordan's King Abdullah II, whom President Joe Biden has been in touch with since the crisis erupted. The Jordanian leader has served as a key mediator in Middle East-related negotiations over several decades. Blinken and Abdullah II discussed the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. They also talked about efforts to secure the release of all hostages and prevent the conflict from widening. Blinken underscored that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination and discussed ways to address the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza while Israel conducts legitimate security operations to defend itself from terrorists, it said. Abbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the West Bank. His Fatah movement is a rival of Hamas, which controls Gaza. Follow live updates from NBC News here. White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said in an interview with MSNBC's Morning Joe on Thursday that the message that Blinken intends to convey to Abbas is to try keep calm in the West Bank because it is in the interest of both Israel and the Palestinians. Things have remained relatively quiet on the West Bank throughout the eruption of this conflict across the border into Gaza, and we hope it stays that way, Finer said. And I believe that President Abbas and Secretary Blinken will discuss how that can be best done, what support we can offer to the Palestinian Authority as they continue to help provide security in the West Bank. Abbas is under pressure from Palestinians because of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government's response to Hamas' attack. The Israeli military on Friday ordered residents of northern Gaza to evacuate south, raising fears a potential ground assault may be imminent. While Blinken met with Israeli officials on Thursday, King Abdullah II spoke with Abbas separately and discussed ways to stop the all-out aggression against our Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian News  Information Agency (WAFA). During their conversation, Abbas called for an immediate end to aggression toward Palestinians and the need to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza as well as water and electricity in the enclave. The news agency said Abbas called for political action to end Israel's occupation but also said that on both sides of the conflict, civilians, prisoners and detainees should be released. Abbas reaffirmed his belief that the Palestinian Liberation Organization is the legitimate group representing all Palestinians; not Hamas, a reminder of how opposed to each other the two groups are. We emphasize the policy of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which renounce violence and adheres to international legitimacy, peaceful popular resistance, and political action as a path to achieving our national goals of freedom and independence, leading to ending the occupation and embodying the independence of our Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 borders, Abbas said in a statement. It is unclear how much influence Abbas might have under the current circumstances, as the PLO and Hamas have largely been adversaries for nearly two decades, with Hamas dismissing all agreements between the PLO and Israel. In a 2006 election, the secular Fatah party of which Abbas serves as chairman lost its majority in the Palestinian territories to Hamas. Hamas took violent control of Gaza in 2007 and, since then, there has been ongoing conflict between Hamas and the PLO. Meanwhile, Blinken, who has been addressing concerns about civilians based in Gaza, said Thursday that he and Netanyahu had discussed possibilities for safe passage for civilians who want to leave or get out of the way in Gaza. That is a conversation a discussion that we will pursue in the coming days, including with some of the countries that we will be visiting, he said. After traveling to Jordan, Blinken is expected to also visit with leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar..",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman.

Our prisons are almost full. Last night the Times reported that 'Lord Justice Edis, the senior presiding judge for England and Wales, has ordered that sentencing of convicted criminals who are currently on bail should be delayed from Monday'. Prisons in England and Wales are now unable to find cell space for every criminal that judges believe should be jailed. This means that next week people convicted of very serious crimes, including historic sex offences, may be found guilty then sent home on bail. Beyond the obvious public protection concerns this delay to justice will further traumatise victims, and reduce confidence in the whole system. Anyone could have predicted this crisis. Last November, Damien Hinds, the prisons minister, activated Operation Safeguard - which makes police cells available to house prisoners for a maximum of one night if no prison cell is available. It is still in use. Our courts system is crumbling In March this year judges were urged to sentence more leniently in light of prison overcrowding. In May, Andrea Albutt, president of the Prison Governors' Association, warned of a 'capacity crisis'. Then the Chief Inspector of Prisons wrote about a prison population 'crisis' in August. The numbers make the problem clear. Over the last year the government has created about 90new prison places per week by making two prisoners share a single person cell, delaying maintenance work, transferring low risk prisoners to open conditions, deploying temporary prison cells, and opening new prisons (once they overcome local planning processes). However, each week up to 200 new prisoners enter the system. The Ministry of Justice blames a 'higher than usual number of offenders coming into prison this year'. Again though, this rise should have been expected. The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised 20,000 additional police officers, and in April of this year the PM announced that this had been achieved. It does not seem surprising that 20,000 more police officers might result in more arrests, but the rest of the system seems entirely unprepared. Similarly, in 2020 the government announced that violent and sexual offenders would spend longer in prison. While protecting the public in this way is popular, the result is further strain on our limited prison capacity. Our courts system is crumbling figuratively and literally and this creates further pressure. Before the pandemic the number of remand prisoners (those awaiting trial or sentencing) was around 9,500. During lockdown, with the courts disrupted, that number rose to around 13,000. While barristers were on strike in 2022 it rose to 15,500. By the end of June this year 15,500 prison spaces were occupied by remand prisoners. In the long-term we need to make prison work, reducing our high reoffending rate so that someone returning to prison become rare. But that work will take years. Right now the government needs to free up capacity in the prison system. This means looking at who can be released early. Home Detention Curfew, or 'tagging' allows low-risk, non-violent prisoners who have displayed good behaviour during their sentence to spend the final months before their conditional release date on curfew at their own homes. At present curfew is only available in the last 180 days of someone is sentence. Increasing this period to nine months, or even 12, would free up a substantial number of open prison spaces. As a result, lower risk prisoners would transfer to open prisons, creating capacity throughout the system. Another option is to adjust sentencing policy, avoiding the use of very short sentences of a few days or months. Much of the public may find this unpalatable if the result is prolific offenders being spared prison. In the same way we struggle to build rail and power capacity it seems we can no longer plan and create enough prison infrastructure. Politicians enact popular, aspirational policies, putting more police on the streets and jailing dangerous criminals for longer, when there is no serious chance of the prison system achieving the necessary capacity. It all feels emblematic of a government and state that has lost its ability to plan or function.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Prisons in England and Wales are now unable to find cell space for every criminal that judges believe should be jailed.

Mike Rogers, R-Ala., emphasized the need for help from Democrats in order to reach the 217 votes. He urged House Democrats to communicate what they need in exchange for helping Republicans.

Here is what to know today: Israel has ordered the entire population of northern Gaza to evacuate south, a warning that leaves more than 1 million people to decide whether to abandon their homes. Hamas urged Gazans to ignore it. Israel's military said the order, which will raise fears of an imminent ground offensive on the densely populated enclave, was intended to minimize civilian casualties in the war against Hamas. But the YOU.N. said it was impossible and risked a disaster. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your morning. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Humanitarian organizations are calling for Israel to reverse its order, with the Norwegian Refugee Council warning that, absent of any guarantees of safety or return, it would amount to the war crime of forcible transfer. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as the YOU.S. grapples with its response to the surprise Hamas attack and the fate of Americans, including some taken hostage. Airstrikes intensified yesterday in Gaza, where more than 1,500 people have been killed and over 6,200 injured. An Israeli siege has blocked electricity, water and other essentials from the region, causing health care systems to reach a breaking point as they grapple with an acute shortage of medical supplies, the World Health Organization said. Authorities in the YOU.S. and across the world were bracing after calls for a worldwide day of rage today in support of Palestinians. Follow our live coverage. House Republicans are expected to meet at the Capitol this morning to nominate a new candidate for speaker after Steve Scalise withdrew from the race yesterday, building further uncertainty in the House more than a week after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. The unexpected decision by House Majority Leader Scalise came after hours of meetings, during which he failed to flip any of his critics to the yes column. To win the speakership, he would have needed at least 217 of 221 Republicans to vote for him on the House floor. Not long after Scalise's announcement, some Republicans said they already have another choice in mind. A Colorado police officer was found guilty and another was acquitted yesterday in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a Black pedestrian whose death set off months of protests against police brutality. Aurora Police Officer Randy Roedema was convicted of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault, and former Aurora officer Jason Rosenblatt was acquitted. Roedema and Rosenblatt detained McClain on August 24, 2019, before paramedics injected him with ketamine. Minutes after he was injected with the sedative, McClain was found to have no pulse and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived but was later declared brain dead and died on August 30. The officer accused of putting McClain in a chokehold is set to go on trial this week. The paramedics who injected McClain will also face trial this year Sky-watchers in Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas, as well as slivers of California, Idaho, Colorado and Arizona are in for a cosmic treat tomorrow, when a solar eclipse will allow people there to witness a rare ring of fire in the sky.

Saturday's eclipse is a much-anticipated event because it is rare for the path of a solar eclipse to cut so cleanly across the continental YOU.S., one expert said.

Several countries there are central to global oil and gas production. The Hamas terror attacks in Israel have thrust the entire region into a hugely uncertain new era, political and otherwise. Energy market analysts are trying to make sense of what it may mean for global oil prices, which have been on a dramatic trajectory since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. As the world reacted to events in Israel at the weekend, crude oil prices jumped by nearly 5 to 89 (83) a barrel on Monday. Uncertainty around potential supply issues caused the spike, but prices have since settled. Israel produces next to no crude oil, but the potential for the conflict to widen in the Middle East has rattled experts. If it turns into a wider conflict, and that causes oil prices to go up, that does have an effect on the economies, Gita Gopinath, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund, told Bloomberg on Wednesday. That is usually one of the channels through which we see that affecting global numbers. US President Joe Biden has expressed concern about the possibility of the conflict developing into a wider one. 1970s oil crises sparked price jumps The most dramatic oil crises of the 20th century followed conflict in the Middle East. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 saw several Arab states attack Israel. The region's biggest oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, then placed an oil embargo on nations that supported Israel, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. That led to an oil crisis, which saw oil prices jump by more than 300. The second big oil crisis, in 1979, followed the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the subsequent drop in oil production that took place in the country. That crisis saw global oil supply fall by around 4, with prices for a barrel of crude oil more than doubling. So far, there is little to suggest that what has happened in Israel will prompt anything like those crises. Prices are currently well below the figure of 97 a barrel that was reached in late September. Suggestions at that time that the price would soon breach 100 per barrel now look wide of the mark. Both WTI West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent retreated yesterday as concerns of a sudden and unexpected supply disruption have been swept aside for now, Tamas Varga, an analyst with PVM Oil Associates, told Reuters on October 11. Brent crude and WTI are the two most traded grades of oil in the world. Brent crude's price is the benchmark for crude oil in Africa, Europe and the Middle East while WTI's price is the benchmark for North America. The market, however, remains jittery given the potential for the conflict to worsen and spread. Magid Shenouda, deputy CEO of the Swiss commodities trader Mercuria, said Wednesday that the company believes prices could breach 100 per barrel if the situation escalates. Israel important to global gas industry While Israel is not a major oil producer, it is a significant player in the global gas industry. In the wake of the Hamas attacks, the country shut down its Tamar natural gas field, around 25 kilometers (15 miles) off its southern coast. Israel exports large volumes of gas to its neighbors, Egypt and Jordan. The shutdown has led to concerns that global gas markets will become even tighter than they have been recently. Egypt uses Israeli gas for some of its own liquified natural gas (LNG) exports and the shutdown in Tamar may impact Egyptian LNG exports to Europe and elsewhere. However, Israel's largest gas field, Leviathan, continues to operate normally. The uncertainty lies in how long the Tamar field will remain shut down. Experts have said a prolonged shutdown would significantly impact Israeli export volumes to Egypt and Jordan, which would have knock-on effects for global LNG markets due to Egypt's role as an LNG exporter and the potential of import rises from elsewhere to Jordan. The role of Iran in global oil The crisis in Israel comes at a time when global energy markets are already tense, given the ongoing uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine which -- combined with the aftereffects of the pandemic and other factors -- contributed to the wider global energy crisis of 2021-23. Oil prices have come down from the 115 peak they hit in June 2022, despite production cuts from Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). On October 4, a few days before the attacks in Israel, OPEC confirmed it would maintain production cuts until the end of 2023. But even after that news, prices continued on the downward trend they have been on since the end of September. The production cuts by Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia mean there is considerable spare capacity in case oil supply is unexpectedly curtailed. However, there is still uncertainty over how Riyadh may respond, given recent tensions with the US. The role of Iran is being closely watched, too. Although Iranian oil is sanctioned, it has flowed in significant volumes to China and elsewhere recently, easing oil markets in the wake of restrictions placed on Russian oil. However, were Iran to become actively involved in the Israel conflict, pressure would come on the US and others to step up enforcement of sanctions on Iranian oil. For now, the crisis has not extended to global energy markets, but the risk of escalation has put the market on watch.

Police released the sketch Wednesday afternoon based on witness recollections of a man they saw on a recreational trail before finding 77-year-old Honoree Fleming dead with a gunshot wound to the head. She was killed on October 5 about one mile south of Vermont State University's Castleton Campus on the Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail. In addition to releasing the sketch to the public, detectives with the Vermont State Police continue to review potential evidence in the case, including forensic evidence with the assistance of the Vermont Forensic Laboratory at the Department of Public Safety in Waterbury, state police wrote on Wednesday. Police described the person as being a 5-foot-10 male in his 20s with short, red hair. He is considered armed and dangerous. Commander of the Vermont State Police Capt. Scott Dunlap told the Associated Press witnesses saw the man acting odd. He added police do not know if the shooting was random or targeted. The Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail is a 19.8-mile section of former railroad that cuts through scenic countryside with vistas of the nearby hills, villages, farms, fields and forests, according to its website. It is a multiple-use trail open to pedestrians, bicyclists, and horseback riders in the summer, and snowshoers, skiers and snowmobiles in the winter. Vermont State University Castleton campus confirmed that Fleming was a retired dean of education at the university. She previously worked as a faculty member at Trinity College, Middlebury College and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Fleming lived in Castleton with her husband Ron Powers, a Pulitzer Prize-winning and New York Times-bestselling author. The university reopened October 9 and resumed classes on October 10 after closing the week prior following Fleming's homicide. In a Facebook post, Powers said his wife was walking along her favorite trail near the college when she was killed. There is an area-wide dragnet out for her killer, he wrote. Police believe that it was random, but all possibilities remain open. Powers added he was with his son, Dean. Those of you who knew her know that she was beautifully named, he wrote about Fleming. I have never known a more sterling heart and soul than hers. She has taken far more than half my own heart and soul with her.

But you might have to go to Elko, Nevada. On Saturday morning, the moon will pass directly in front of the sun for more than 6.6 million people from Oregon to Texas. But during this rare solar eclipse -- the first of its kind in the Western YOU.S. since 2012 -- the moon is at apogee, or farther from earth than normal. That means it will not appear large enough to completely blot out the sun. Instead, the result is an annular eclipse, also known as a Ring of Fire eclipse for the thin band of the sun that remains visible around the moon. The phenomenon kicks off early. As the sun rises over the West on Saturday, viewers will notice a black disc -- the moon -- slipping over the earth's life-giving star from above as early as 9 a.m. Mountain Time (8 a.m. Pacific Time, 10 a.m. Central Time ). For viewers in the path of totality, inside the antumbra shadow cast by the moon onto Earth, the moon will gradually slide to the center of the sun. The phenomenon will last only a couple minutes before the moon appears to glide off the other side of the sun. People are also reading...

Since the moon never fully shields the sun, special eclipse-viewing glasses are needed for the duration. The rest of the YOU.S. and almost all of North America will be in the penumbra, or a partial shadow of the sun. Viewers in those places will see the moon pass across the sun without perfectly covering its center. Locations closer to the path of the antumbra will see a greater degree of partial eclipse. Viewers in Missoula, for example, will see slightly more than 70 coverage of the sun. Viewers in Buffalo, New York, will see about 25. About 80.7 million people, or roughly one-quarter of the YOU.S. population, live within 300 miles of the path of the eclipse. NASA created an interactive online map for tracking the eclipse path, accessible at svs.gsfc.nasa.govwebappseclipse-explorer. From Oregon to Texas: The viewing path At about 9:17 a.m. Pacific Time, the full Ring of Fire eclipse will begin in Eugene, Oregon, and will last for approximately 3.5 minutes. At that time, the sun will appear at 18 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of 121 degrees, or in the east-southeast sky. By 9:22 a.m. Pacific, the path of total eclipse will wash over Elko, Nevada, where full eclipse will last about 4 minutes. Locations slightly south of Elko, such as Carlin, will get 4.5 minutes. During that time, the sun will appear at 24 degrees above the horizon in the southeast sky. The eclipse will pass over the Four Corners area of the Southwest from 10:30-10:35 a.m. Mountain Time, and will appear at 32 degrees above the horizon in the southeast sky. (Most of Arizona does not observe daylight saving time and is currently one hour earlier than Mountain Time. The Navajo Reservation in the state's northeast corner and around Four Corners does observe daylight saving time and will be on Mountain Daylight Time.) By 11:52 a.m. Central Time, the eclipse will pass over the San Antonio, Texas, area for nearly 4.5 minutes. The sun will appear at 46 degrees above the horizon -- approximately halfway between the horizon and directly overhead -- in the south-southeast sky. From there, the eclipse path will glide off into the Gulf of Mexico. Varying degrees of a slowly diminishing partial eclipse will remain visible for the entire YOU.S. until about 11:36 a.m. Mountain Time. After that, the sun will gradually appear whole for YOU.S. viewers from west to east, beginning with the Pacific Northwest. Southern Florida will experience a partial eclipse until just after 1 p.m. Mountain Time, or 3 p.m. Eastern.

Sarah Wrenfrow, operations manager at Iron Horse RV Park in Elko, said Wednesday that We have been sold out on RV spaces for over a month because of the eclipse. The park boasts 107 spots, slightly more than half of which are open for nightly and weekly stays. The rest of them are home to seasonal or year-round RVers. And there are cabins available to rent. Wrenfrow said it is unusual to be booked solid in October. This weekend, in fact, is the only time this month the park will be full. And they are not the only ones. She said that everyone who has called the park or its affiliated hotel in town has said they cannot find any available lodging in the area. It is my understanding that all forms of lodging in Elko are completely sold out, she said. I heard that Battle Mountain is also sold out. The California Trail Interpretive Center in Elko is hosting an eclipse watch-party starting at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time. Elsewhere, the impacts of the eclipse were not as clear. Melissa Jegglie, who oversees reservations and the campground store at AlbanyCorvallis KOA campground in Oregon, just north of Eugene, said Wednesday that the campground is sold out this weekend. But that is normal, she said, because there is an Oregon State University football game and it is parents weekend at the school. She was not sure if any campers were there for the eclipse. Even without the eclipse we are normally pretty packed, she said. On the southwest edge of San Antonio, a worker at the front desk of Best Western Plus Palo Alto Inn  Suites said Wednesday that the hotel did not see any rise in bookings for the weekend. He was not aware of this weekend's eclipse until two days ago, he said. Eclipse repeat come 2024 Although stunning in its own right, Saturday's eclipse is somewhat of a preview for an upcoming eclipse in spring. On April 8, 2024, a true total solar eclipse -- where the moon fully covers the sun and reveals a corona of plasma around the veiled star -- will sweep across the YOU.S. from Texas to Maine. It will be the first total solar eclipse across the YOU.S mainland since 2017, when the so-called Great American Eclipse briefly turned day into night from coast to coast. San Antonio's northwest side and a swath of Texas immediately west will fully experience both the October 14 and April 8 eclipses. Although this weekend's Ring of Fire eclipse may not result in as much fanfare there, April's total eclipse seems to already be drawing large amounts of hopeful viewers. At the Best Western, we are almost completely sold out for the April 8 total solar eclipse. Those were selling out about a month ago.

Anyone that vacates the right of others to exist peacefully vacates the right of themselves to exist peacefully. When peace is vacated, humanity is vacated. The same is true of hate. Hate never has any justification. When compassion is vacated, so is humanity. There is nothing divine about either terrorism or hate -- both are diabolic. There is no such thing as a Holy War, all war is diabolic. Those who do not accept the diversity of others, do not allow the equality of others, will not treat others equitably, and will attempt to exclude their voice and free will in life, do not deserve to be accepted, do not deserve equality or equity, and do not deserve to have their voice heard or their free will in life abided. There are those among us who want to dominate, subjugate, control, and own others and force them to be the vanity of their own self-image. This is cruelty and not humanity. Acceptance and compassion are the human way and the only humanity will persist. If we do not awaken to this, we will be devoured by a nightmare made real. Robert Moreland, Lexington My father is an 84-year-old Palestinian, born near Bethlehem in 1939 in the town of Battir. He is not a terrorist. He is an electrical engineer. He is a man who escaped the unlivable conditions in Palestine 60 years ago and now watches yet another generation endure unimaginable suffering. He sheltered in caves of Bethlehem for one year in 1948 with his family, as over 500 Palestinian villages were destroyed; the state of Israel was being established. When my father returned to his house, as a 10-year-old boy, his home was standing, yet villages across the railroad tracks were gone. For those many Palestinian families who survived this trauma, yet no longer had homes, camps were established, such as those in the Gaza strip. This is a complicated human catastrophe. The Israel-Palestinian grief remains a constant. The families of Gaza, people marginalized by their mere existence, will not be able to pay for the terrorist attack last weekend. They have nothing to give. They never did. The tragedy unfolding now should be viewed as such. I pray our leaders will be able to see a path out of this seemingly forever failure to establish a plan for peaceful co-existence. Miriam Lightfoot, Lexington Let us hope Israel does not make the same mistake that the YOU.S. made in Vietnam during the incursion into Cambodia in May 1970. Israel's campaign should have no time limits nor limitations on where they can strike or how much destruction they can inflict; they must remove Hamas as an evil in the area. Only with Hamas's elimination can Israel find security and protect her people from future carnage. The American thrust into Cambodia was limited in duration and limited to 30 klicks when it should have been an unlimited deeper thrust. Sanctuaries were destroyed but not totally eradicated as the enemy rebuilt to return later to kill more Americans. It was a partial success. Hopefully, Israel will permanently destroy Hamas as a military, terrorist and political entity, and free the Palestinian people from the reign of terror existing in Gaza since 2007 when Hamas took control. In war, decisive measures of total destruction have proven to bring good results; Rome against Carthage, Genghis Khan against China, Sherman in Georgia and the YOU.S. against Japan. Evil forces only understand the same brutality they inflict on others. With Biden's open borders policies, the devastation seen in Israel is sadly coming to America! Robert Adams, Lexington I noticed that when the Republican candidate for governor, Ky. Attorney General Daniel Cameron, defended himself last week from Gov. Andy Beshear's advertisement regarding his extreme position on abortion, he did not mention anything about the survivor, Hadley, at all. When he was elected attorney general, he promised to do something about one of Kentucky's worst claims to fame: child abuse. In his defense against Hadley's rightful charge against him, Cameron said he cared. He cared about prosecuting the abusive stepfather and seemed to care about saving pregnancy tissue. But in my opinion, he does not care about the lives of pregnant people in Kentucky, a state with inordinately high negative pregnancy outcomes. That is not pro-life. That is using a politicized issue to win political power. Our governor's race with Gov. Andy Beshear running for reelection enjoys national attention. Beshear's popularity is well known as the guy who pulled Kentucky through a pandemic and multiple weather disasters with dignity, caring and respect while enduring constant law suits from Republicans. Frankfort's supermajority was happy wasting taxpayers money on legal fees instead of teacher raises and funding statewide schools. Nothing blew-up against Republicans like voters NO to Amendments 1 and 2: Adding days, collecting more money, power grabbing laws and a Trigger Law abortion ban that failed to include exceptions in the case of rape and incest. Republicans overreaching law touching every female in Kentucky is shocking, cruel and sick. Will voters surprise Republicans again? Beshear needs all five constitutional officers in the same party to work effectively together for even more wealth, success and protections for us. Beshear defied Republicans and won. The state is richer than ever and voters want women to know they will be safe in Kentucky. What a great PR billboard sign it will make. Welcome to Kentucky - Stupid does not live here anymore. Judy Rembacki, Georgetown A recent headline said, Ky. Governor poll shows Beshear with a big lead over Cameron was the best news I have heard in months. Thank you, Kentuckians, for realizing that we are so fortunate to have the one of the best governors in the YOU.S. and for realizing that it is extremely important to keep him for another four years. This is neither a comment on Cameron nor Republicans vs. Democrats, but rather a considered opinion about what is good for Kentucky. Harry Clarke, Lexington With announcements of infrastructure investments of rail, old issues arise. Was infrastructure investment in roads or bridges better than investment for access to fast passenger rail travel, maybe down interstate highway land? Why not invest in safe methods of ride sharing with ID cards and computerized methods for finding drivers going in the same direction? We need to cut down on individual car ownership and our individuals' investments as well as our desperate need for cars. Will we replace the massive number of semi-trucks on the roads, burning diesel and contributing to pollution now? We need to make sure truck drivers are not abused by the change while we think of ways to share work, not just create jobs. It is all a mistake that needs philosophical changes in American social, economic and political thinking. We cannot continue to ravish the earth for momentary pleasures. We cannot set, and advertise to the world, a lifestyle of spend, spend, spend while driving prices of our own simple living here up for many people. The future is not going to be a pleasant task, or sight to live in, for those we are forcing our mistakes on. Don Pratt, Lexington Our news streams are full of political information, opinions and polling results. This is a friendly reminder that our votes get the final say. Please vote. Karen Gerstle, Lexington News flash for Rep. Josh Calloway (R-Irvington) who said, One of the single greatest things we can do to clean up that public education system is to give parents choice and give them the opportunity to choose where they send their child to be educated. Parents already have that choice. But they do not have the right to ask someone else to pay for it. Nor should they. Carole Boyd, Lexington The media can capture hundreds of urban youth of color ravaging high-end stores, shattering store fronts and hauling out thousands of dollars worth of retail goods. Viral videos expose this urban decay for all the world to see. Social media coordinates and facilitates these attacks. Urban density is the perfect venue to display these horrendous events. What we seldom see are the hundreds of thousands of primarily white crimes that includes car thefts, car break-ins, garage thefts, porch bandits, and thefts of catalytic converters, copper, trade tools, farm equipment, guns and even animals. Viral video seldom catches these geographically diverse events. Flea markets fence these items every day without conscious recognition of the fruits of these theft events. We need to give equal recognition to urban, suburban and rural theft. Theft is driven by both poverty and opportunistic greed.

Russia sent dozens of tanks and armored vehicles and thousands of troops into the assault, which started four days ago. They are hitting with everything they have. Yesterday a lot of armor was used, they came in columns. The assault is not stopping neither day or night, Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka's military administration, said on Ukrainian television. Russia has also launched smaller offensive operations at points all along the front line, intensifying an offensive near the city of Kupiansk, which Ukraine liberated last year, according to Ukrainian troops on the ground. But the main attack is on Avdiivka, which holds major strategic significance for both sides. Avdiivka is located close to Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-occupied Donetsk region. Ukraine heavily fortified the line at Avdiivka prior to Russia's full-scale invasion last year, constructing deep trenches and a system of underground bunkers. As a result, Russian forces have barely advanced near the city. Russia now appears to be seeking to cut off Avdiivka and surround the Ukrainian forces inside its defenses. For the entire time of the war, there has never been such an offensive around Avdiivka, even though they have attacked Avdiivka since 2014, Oleksiy Dmitrashkivsky, chief spokesman for the Command of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, told ABC News. He said two Russian battalions, numbering around 2,000 men and backed by dozens of tanks and other armored vehicles, had begun the attacks, pushing from the northwest and southwest. A massive artillery and air barrage had preceded the assault and has continued since, with frequent strikes on the city itself. So far the Russian assault has appeared to have gone badly, according to Ukrainian military officials and open source researchers tracking the losses. Barabash, Avdiivka's military administration chief, said at least 40 Russian armored vehicles had been lost in two days. Videos circulating online of the attacks appeared to largely support those claims, with some open source researchers saying 30 to 50 Russian tanks and other vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine's general staff claimed over 1,000 Russian troops had been killed and injured since the new offensive operation began. The Institute for the Study of War said Russia had managed to capture roughly 4.52 square kilometers of territory from different directions around Avdiivka in the last three days. Russian forces have not secured any major breakthroughs near Avdiivka as of October 12 and are unlikely to immediately cut off Ukrainian forces in the city, ISW wrote in its daily briefing Thursday. Ukrainian military officials said their troops have successfully held the lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the Russian attackers, though Ukrainian casualties were also large. The new Russian offensive -- the scale of which seemed to catch some analysts off-guard -- nonetheless was significant because it appears to show Russia's attempt to regain the initiative in the war. The Russians have decided that they can already start their own counterattack in the Avdiivka direction, Dmitrashkivsky said. They are taking advantage of the fact that the attention of the whole world is on the events in Israel and they have started an active phase along the entire front line. He said the Russian attack near Avdiivka had involved a mixed force of paratroopers and poorly trained forces, as well as so-called Storm Z units -- detachments of convicts sent to fight. They were very weakly prepared and that showed in their losses, Dmitrashkivsky said. The attack had been exceptionally large, he added, requiring huge efforts from Ukrainian troops to blunt it. Most analysts believe Russia likely still lacks the manpower to make significant gains in an offensive, including around Avdiivka. But the push indicated Russia hopes to further blunt Ukraine's counteroffensive with its own counterpunch, coming as the weather starts to worsen. Ukraine is continuing to press its own attacks in the southern Zaporizhzhia region where its counteroffensive is focused and around the city of Bakhmut.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Russia sent dozens of tanks and armored vehicles and thousands of troops into the assault.

Affected passengers have been notified of their options to change flights (free of charge) or receive a full refund. So far in 2023, there has been 64 days of ATC strikes (over 12 times more than in 2022) forcing airlines to cancel thousands of EU overflights from Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the UK, while France uses Minimum Service Laws to protect French flights.

No new strikes were announced Friday, but autoworkers in the Greater Cleveland remain out of work, either because they are on strike or were laid off by the automakers. Fain said in a livestream to UAW members that the strike has moved into a new phase, which started on Wednesday, when 8,700 workers went on strike at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant without a prior announcement. The UAW has been using a new targeted strike strategy where they pick key facilities to strike at each automaker. Before, the strikes were announced a few hours in advance. Fain said automakers were trying to avoid strikes by making new offers right before his livestreams were scheduled on Fridays. But because of this, he said they were not making offers throughout the week. A negotiation requires both sides making movement, Fain said. If they are not going to move, we are going to give them a push in a language that they can understand, dollars and cents.

Long before Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel on Saturday in an unprecedented breach, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's grip on power was in peril. Netanyahu, on trial for corruption, and his far-right coalition had faced eight months of widespread protests over a judicial overhaul that critics said was pushing Israel toward autocracy. Now, after attacks that have left more than 1,300 Israelis dead, many Israelis are seething, deeming the security and intelligence failures a fresh set of reasons why their leaders must be stripped of power. In some cases, the fury has erupted into public confrontations between Israeli citizens and government ministers in the days since the attacks. You are responsible! Go home, one Israeli woman shouted through tears at Idit Silman, an Israeli cabinet minister, as she visited a hospital treating wounded from the attack this week. Yet even some of Netanyahu's harshest critics are holding off on pushing for his government to be kicked out immediately, wary of provoking more instability at a time when the Israeli public and its military are most vulnerable. Josh Drill, a prominent leader in the protest movement, spent much of the past year rallying Israelis to rise up against Netanyahu's government, arguing that Israel was barreling towards becoming a dictatorial regime. But in the days since the attacks, many of the protest organizations have redirected their focus to collecting food for displaced Israelis and equipment for soldiers called into service, said Drill, a former Israeli military officer. Our main objective is to win the war, Drill said in an interview. But when it comes to Netanyahu's future, he added cryptically: We understand what needs to happen the day after the war. In the midst of crises that shake a nation's core sense of stability, political leaders historically tend to see a boost in popularity, as anxious citizens rally 'round the flag. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, then-President George W. Bush's approval rating surged to 90, the highest ever recorded in Gallup polling. So far, it is unclear whether Netanyahu will receive any such boost, especially as many Israelis are publicly blaming his government for failing to detect Hamas' elaborately planned attack in advance -- and questioning whether he instead was distracted by his campaign to force through controversial judicial changes. In an apparent bid to mollify any mass defection by the public, Netanyahu on Wednesday announced he would formed a wartime unity government that includes Benny Gantz, a chief political rival. The people are united and today its leadership is also united, Netanyahu said. We have put aside every other consideration because the fate of our country is at stake. Yet with grieving Israelis demanding answers for what went wrong, there were signs that even some of the prime minister's allies felt compelled to own up to the shortcomings. Education Minister Yoav Kisch, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, acknowledged in a striking interview Thursday that he and Israel's government bore responsibility. We were busy with nonsense. We would forgotten where we live, Kisch told the Israeli news outlet Ynet. But, he added: Now is not the time to deal with this. Others in Israel's military and political leadership have similarly conceded that the government and its security agencies fell short when it mattered most, even as they suggested the time for accountability would come later. Mark Regev, a senior Netanyahu adviser, told NBC News' Andrea Mitchell that obviously there was a mishap but said the time for investigations would come when this is over. IDF is responsible for the security of our nation and its citizens, and we failed to do so, Herzi Halevi, the military chief of staff, told reporters on Thursday, using an acronym for Israel's military. We will look into it, we will investigate, but now it is time for war. At the same time, the Israeli public's exasperation over that deadly failure is increasingly spilling into public view. Nir Barkat, the economy minister and longtime Netanyahu ally, was confronted during his own hospital visit by angry Israelis who shouted where were you? videos posted on social media show. And Silman, the environmental protection minister, was chased out of the hospital by a man in medical scrubs who blamed her for paving the path to Israel's current government -- and, by extension, its security predicament. In 2022 Silman played a major role in former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's downfall when she resigned from his coalition, forcing Bennett to lose his governing majority and clearing the way for Netanyahu's return to power. Now it is our turn! Get away. We will help, the man shouted, slapping his hands together as Silman exited through the ambulance bay. You have ruined this place, now go away from here!",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israelis furious over government's failure to prevent unspeakable bloodshed.

What is this toxic chemical?,"Israel's relentless attack on Gaza continues. Since the start of the conflict last Saturday after Hamas's stealth attack, the Israeli military has dropped 6,000 munitions on the enclave, every 30 seconds. The death toll in the strip has climbed to more than 1,400. There has been growing speculation that both sides have committed war crimes. Amid this, a rights group has accused the Israeli forces of using white phosphorus. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions in its military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, saying the use of such weapons puts civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury, according to a report by Reuters. While the Israeli military has launched retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, it is also fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran. Do not miss: Our special coverage from Tel Aviv on the Israel-Hamas war Human Rights Watch claims that verified videos taken in Lebanon on 10 October and Gaza on 11 October show multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border. It provided links to two videos posted on social media that showed 155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles being used, apparently as smokescreens, marking, or signalling. Both show scenes near the Israel-Lebanon border, it said. They did not post a video of the use of the munitions in Gaza but Palestinian TV channels have broadcast videos in recent days showing thin plumes of white smoke lining the sky over the Hamas-controlled enclave. We explain what this dangerous chemical substance is and how it has been used in conflict in the past. What is white phosphorus? White phosphorus is a toxic chemical, which burns at more than 800 degrees Celsius, which is high enough to melt metal. Often yellowish or colourless, this wax-like chemical substance, some say, smells like garlic. It is used as a weapon in conflict and is deployed in the form of bombs, grenades, rockets or artillery shells, according to a report by Al-Jazeera. White phosphorous munitions are made after combining a mixture of white phosphorus and rubber. Since the chemical ignites instantly in contact with oxygen, its function as a weapon is to burn, fast and bright. It is used by militaries around the world, including Israel and the United States, to illuminate targets as part of tracer munitions at night. White phosphorus weapons are also used to create smokescreens during the day, as they release a huge amount of smoke when burned. The smoke lasts for close to seven minutes. This is why phosphor remains one of the fastest ways to make highly dense and effective smoke screens, according to Dan Kaszeta, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, the UK's leading security and defence think tank. Who can broker peace between Israel, Hamas? Can India help? Israel-Palestine conflict: Why India cannot afford to take sides How a drawn-out Israel-Hamas war could hurt the Indian economy How Sanjeev Singla, India's envoy in Tel Aviv, is assuring the safety of nationals in Israe How dangerous are white phosphorus munitions? White phosphorus burns human skin and disintegrates tissues inside the body. It ignites when exposed to oxygen and continues to burn until it is deprived of oxygen or it is exhausted, reports Al-Jazeera. The toxic chemicals are absorbed by the body and because multiple organs like the heart, liver and kidneys to dysfunction. The burns have a double effect - they have a local effect because of the burn itself which is generally quite severe and very deep, and then the second effect is metabolic, which can kill the patients, Roman Hossein Khonsari, professor of maxillofacial surgery and plastic surgery at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris told Al-Jazeera. According to Khonsari, who worked during the Armenia-Azerbaijan war, if doctors are unable to identify that burns are caused by white phosphorus and the victim does not receive necessary treatment, they face a risk of organ failure. Experts say that white phosphorus sticks to many surfaces, including skin and clothing, and is difficult to wash off. Inhaling the fumes can be lethal, leading to severe irritation to the eyes and making them sensitive to light. Exposure to the chemical can also result in facial paralysis and seizures. White phosphorus is not banned in wars by international conventions. It has been categorised as incendiary weapons designed to set fire to objects or because burn or respiratory injury to people through the action of flame, heat, or combination thereof... under Protocol III in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), signed in Geneva and enforced from 1983. However, its use as an incendiary weapon has been banned in areas with civil population. There is one loophole in the restrictions though. Incendiary weapons launched from the ground are governed by less strict guidelines than those dropped from the air. Israel and the US are not signatories to Protocol III. They claimed to use white phosphorus in line with international regulations. Has Israel used white phosphorous in Gaza? Israel's military said it was currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza. It did not comment on allegations of their use in Lebanon. However, this is not the first time Israel has been accused of using the highly combustible substance in Gaza. According to HRW, the Israeli Defense Forces used white phosphorus during a 22-day conflict, Operation Lead Cast, in Gaza, which lasted from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009. The Israeli military repeatedly exploded white phosphorus munitions in the air over populated areas, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital, HRW said in its 2009 report. Back then, the Israeli military first said that it used white phosphorus to mark targets but later denied using it. Israel said it had launched its investigation which proved that the use of white phosphorus was for operational needs only. Based on the findings at this stage, it is already possible to conclude that the army's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law... These shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law, the Israeli army had said in a statement.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions in its military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.

Across the country, people begin to stir. They pour their cups of coffee, they butter their toast, and they turn on the news. Boris Johnson has won the 2019 general election for the Conservative party, with a thumping majority of 80 seats. The Labour party of Jeremy Corbyn is in utter disarray, with their so called red wall of seats in northern England in pieces, replaced by a corresponding blue wall of Conservative MPs. The question over why the red wall crumbled will haunt journalists for years to come- was it because of Brexit? Was it a fear of Corbyn? Was it a distrust in Labour over the economy? Was it the promise of levelling up? If the fall of the red wall was for any of those reasons, then the voters who switched from Labour to Conservative must be severely disappointed. Brexit has arguably been a failure- the oven ready deal that Johnson campaigned on in 2019 did not exist and the flourishing economy that voters were promised is now in the shackles of a cost-of-living crisis affecting millions. Even Brexiteer-in-Chief Nigel Farage admitted on Newsnight that Brexit has been a failure (of course, he still believes in the because, but the admission speaks volumes), and I am sure that the 3 million people who were recipients of a food bank parcel last year would agree. Voters who feared Corbyn and how he would handle the economy must be laughing- after 49 days of a Liz Truss government, a Corbyn economy must seem like utopian bliss. Arguably, the promise of Johnson to level up is why so many of the red wall voters switched over to the Conservatives. Whether or not you believed in Brexit, the promise of billions being invested into deprived areas was an appealing policy. Part of the levelling up agenda announced in 2019 included a commitment to invest in Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester with a focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle as part of a 100bn National Infrastructure Strategy. These rail connections relied on an existing and ongoing rail project, High Speed Two (HS2), but as all major parties had committed to this in 2010, voters did not appear concerned that Northern Powerhouse Rail, or even HS2, would not be able to go ahead. Levelling up was happening, and people were turning out in their dozens to vote for Johnson's Conservative party. HS2 is the high-speed rail network that was planned to link London and major cities in the north and the midlands. Proposed in 2010, the line was meant to connect London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, but in 2021 the Leeds leg was scrapped over concerns surrounding the rising cost of the project, and during the Conservative Party Conference in October 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the line between Birmingham and Manchester was going to be abandoned in favour of spending the money on local infrastructure. What was once a revolutionary project, designed to link London with the north via high-speed rail, and create hubs between major northern cities, is now a journey from Birmingham Curzon Street Station to London Euston. He has said that the line will run up to Manchester, just not at high speed like the initial promise. HS2 has failed. The dreams of high-speed rail linking the country is just that. A dream. A dream that has cost the government 100 billion, and that is not including the cost of the trains. How has the government of a G7 country failed so horribly at something that should be so simple- France has just commissioned 203 miles of high-speed rail starting in Bordeaux, and this is estimated to cost 12 billion. That is double the length of the London to Birmingham route, at just 12 of the cost. So why has HS2 been so expensive compared to other countries? The answer is simple- a large amount of the route that HS2 takes cuts through marginal Conservative constituencies, and so the residents must be consulted, and MPs must be appeased. Additionally, the cost of building supplies has increased with inflation and the war in Ukraine, and the actual building of tracks and creating tunnels is expensive. Despite these factors, the fact that it has taken a government nine years to get the building of 330 miles of railway tracks underway is shameful, and the lack of this railway network will be felt across the country. The lack of HS2 will be felt most notably in the north of England, as the proposed project of Northern Powerhouse Rail relies on a section of track between Manchester and Liverpool being shared with the HS2 line. Now that HS2 is not being built, the lack of this section of the line throws the future of Northern Powerhouse Rail into question. Even if Rishi Sunak is promising 36 billion in transport infrastructure for the north, this does not answer the question of how this issue is going to be solved. It also does not fix the fact that these plans have been in the works for years, and he has let down the north, again. As Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said at a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference, This will be remembered as the conference when they pulled the plug on us. What gives them the right to treat people here in Greater Manchester and the north of England as second-class citizens?. Sunak is not only facing criticism from members of the Labour Party- the Conservative politician Andy Street said at an impromptu press conference that Sunak will be turning his back on an opportunity to level up - a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Burnham and Street are right. People of the north have consistently been treated as second class citizens, and it speaks to the wider views of the Conservative government that they are cancelling a project that would create a powerful northern economy, one that could potentially grow to provide huge benefits for the country. This let down of the north is potentially going to be what costs Sunak the general election- if you were promised levelling up in 2019, why on earth would you believe in anything else the Conservatives promise you? The cancellation of HS2 is not levelling up by any stretch of the imagination. This is not the country that those red-turned-blue-wall voters were promised in 2019. This is an abject failure by a government that is tumbling down in the opinion polls, trying to grasp onto anything that might save them. Scrapping HS2 will not be their saving grace. True investment in the north means ensuring that levelling up is not just a campaign slogan but is something that people can point to and say that it was a genuine success. Levelling up was always meant to be about giving funds where they were most needed- if HS2 is not deemed worthy, other causes must be found.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Boris Johnson has won the 2019 general election for the Conservative party, with a thumping majority of 80 seats.

Vale of Glamorgan Council has confirmed that there are still no buses set to service the transport project in Barry, Wales. Barry Transport Interchange, situated outside Barry Docks Railway Station, was developed to improve connectivity in the Vale and so far includes a taxi rank, bike shelters and bus stops. The leader of the Plaid Cymru group at Vale of Glamorgan Council, Cllr Ian Johnson, called the project in its current state a waste of public money. Bus companies across Wales are struggling at the moment due to reduced funding and recovering passenger numbers following the Covid-19 pandemic, WalesOnline writes. Many services have recently been changed or cut altogether. Cllr Ian Johnson said: Vale of Glamorgan Council officers have done very well in ensuring that the bus station has been built, but there is no point in a bus station with no buses. He added: There is nothing new about the drop in passengers following Covid-19, and that was known well before the construction of the bus station earlier this year. This is a major multi-million pound project that will not be used at any time soon for the reason it was built. That is a waste of public money at a time when the Labour Council are telling us to get ready for large scale cuts. Construction on phase one of Barry Transport Interchange started in January, 2023, and electric car charging points will soon be connected to the site. Adventure Travel's number 88 bus service was originally supposed to take passengers to and from the new interchange, but it has since been withdrawn. Vale of Glamorgan Council said in April that Cardiff Bus was considering which of its services could operate at the interchange. The company later announced that it was also withdrawing and making changes to a number of its services from September and no services were shown to be set to operate at Barry Transport Interchange in updated timetables. At a Vale of Glamorgan Council meeting on September 25, Cllr Ian Johnson asked what conversations cabinet members were having with other authorities and the Welsh Government with regards to ensuring that revenue funding is found for bus services in the future. In response, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for neighbourhood and building services, Cllr Mark Wilson, said: We have regular meetings with our fellow cabinet members to discuss this and we lobby Welsh Government, along with other local authorities, to get a bigger chunk of available funding. A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesperson said: Unfortunately, the interchange has been completed at a very difficult time for the bus industry. Reductions in government funding, reduced post-pandemic passenger numbers, and a shortage of drivers have all contributed to reductions in bus services. In the short term the new interchange will be used for Transport for Wales rail replacement services while upgrades to the local train network are undertaken. The council is also in discussions with local bus providers to see if the new interchange can be incorporated into any existing routes. In the long term, as new residential developments in the area are completed, we anticipate that there will be a commercial interest from the local bus operators that currently serve Barry and we still expect the interchange to come into regular use. This is only one aspect of the council's work to support bus services in the Vale. Since April, the council has increased spending on local bus services by more than 100,000, taking our total investment this year to around 500,000. This funding has been used to provide bus services where companies do not operate on a commercial basis, including the rural Vale, and to pay operators to run services that we know are valued by the community in the evening and on weekends.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Barry Transport Interchange was built to improve connectivity in the Vale.

Honoree Fleming, 77, was discovered dead on 5 October on a hiking trail near Vermont State University Castleton Campus, where she used to work. The sketch was based on witness descriptions of a man they saw enter the trail before her body was found. The killing has shocked the small town of Castleton, Vermont. Police say the suspect is a 5ft 10in (1.78m) white male with red hair who seemed to be in his 20s. They say he wore a dark grey T-shirt and a black backpack and is armed and dangerous. There was more than one witness that observed this individual just prior to coming across Miss Fleming's body, Vermont State Police Captain Scott Dunlap told a news conference on Wednesday. He said without elaborating that the potential suspect was observed to be acting very strangely. It is unclear if the shooting was targeted or random. Police are asking anyone who recognises the man in the sketch to come forward. Officials did not release any other details about the case, which has been ruled a homicide. The Burlington Medical Examiner's office determined Ms Fleming died from the gunshot wound to the head. She was attacked while on her regular afternoon walk last Thursday along the Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail, a 20-mile (32km) section of former railway that is used by pedestrians and cyclists. Ms Fleming was the dean of education at Vermont State University before she retired in 2012. In a statement on Facebook, the college said more police would patrol the campus. The university said Ms Fleming was beloved by faculty, staff and students. A professor of education and biochemist, she was still publishing academic papers on cellular biology. Her contributions to education and her impact on our campus will live on in all of us, the college said. Ms Fleming lived in Castleton with her husband Ron Powers, who in 1973 became the first television critic to win a Pulitzer Prize.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Honoree Fleming, 77, was found dead on a hiking trail in Castleton, Vermont.

Heavy downpours began affecting London last night, with Victoria station on the London Underground part closed today due to flooding. Eastbound Circle and District line trains were not stopping at the station during the morning rush hour. Tube passenger Martin O'Keefe tweeted this morning: 'I do not know how this godforsaken country ever thought it could deliver HS2 when the UK's current rail infrastructure will not even allow half the trains on the Circle and District Line to stop at London Victoria due to flooding. Absolutely pathetic.' Nearly three inches of rain could fall in parts of southern England and Wales over today and tomorrow - with the Met Office warning of possible travel delays. A yellow weather warning for rain was imposed over all of southern England, the West Midlands and the whole of Wales from 9pm tonight until the end of tomorrow - with up to 1.2in (30mm) in two hours and 2.8in (70mm) over the 27-hour period. Early this morning, the mercury dropped to -2C (28F) at Katesbridge in Northern Ireland and -1C (30F) at Eskdalemuir in Scotland, where snow on the mountains is possible in the coming days - as well as a widespread overnight frost across the UK. This weekend, lows of -3C (27F) in Scotland and Northern Ireland could lead to air frosts while cities of England will drop to 2C (36F), potentially colder in rural areas. It comes after Britain enjoyed its longest run of consecutive October days above 25C (77F) since 1959, with four recorded between Saturday and Tuesday. Sunday was the UK's warmest October day in five years as temperatures hit 25.8C (78.4F) in London. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: 'On Wednesday night, there may potentially be some frosts and much colder than average conditions, which might be a shock for northern parts of Britain because we have had this relatively warm air across most of the UK. There will be an increasing tendency towards cooler conditions, however in the southern parts of England and Wales we have got the prospect of heavy rain coming in.' 'We are saying there is a significant rain warning from 9pm on Thursday through to midnight on Friday, and we can expect 20mm (0.8in) to 30mm (1.2in) in some places in a couple of hours. Even up to 50mm (2in), 60mm (2.4in) or possibly up to 70mm (2.8in) across the high ground of Wales, these are significant amounts. Once that warning expires, we have got another shift in our weather pattern where we are getting a more northerly flow coming in. That will introduce much cooler conditions, six degrees below average, which given the fact a few days ago we were talking about conditions six or so degrees above average, will feel like a marked contrast. We have got the prospect on Saturday of early frost in some sheltered northern areas, even some snowfall over the Scottish mountains.' The warning over flooding in England and Wales coms after Scotland was battered by heavy rainfall last weekend, causing flooding and leading to train cancellations and road closures. Some railway stations flooded, with tracks under feet of water. On Tuesday night, the body of a man was recovered from the River Tay in Newport-on-Tay, Fife, after a major search operation. His identity and age are not known, but it was not connected to the search for missing Struan Robertson, 77, who was swept away by floods as his helpless wife Patricia watched on. The family of Struan Robertson, 77, who owns the Pitcastle Estate in Strathtay, Perthshire, fear he has lost his life. Mr Robertson was engulfed by the swollen River Tay and dragged downstream by the powerful current as he tried to clear a clogged hydropower device. Also along the River Tay, caravans and tents were pictured under water at Aberfeldy Caravan Park in Perth and Kinross. Elsewhere, ten motorists were airlifted to safety on Saturday due to landslides on the A83 in Argyll and Bute, which dislodged 2,000 tonnes of debris. Another four were airlifted in Kilmartin, Argyll and Bute. The A83 between the Rest And Be Thankful and Inveraray was closed for work to remove debris from landslips, but has since reopened. Six further landslips were identified as a result of the work, Bear Scotland said. Meanwhile, farmers across Scotland suffered millions of pounds worth of losses in unharvested crops after a month's worth of rain fell in just 24 hours. High-value produce including turnips, broccoli and potatoes were destroyed in the weekend deluge, with the agricultural industry fearing it has suffered one of its worst ever losses. Thousands of acres of farmland remain under water, with some farmers losing entire fields of crops, including 350,000 worth of swedes at a farm Perthshire. But conditions were beautiful in southern England over the weekend, with the Met Office saying 25.8C (78.4F) at Kew Gardens in London on Sunday was the highest October temperature since 26.5C (79.7F) was recorded at Donna Nook, Lincolnshire, in 2018.

In closing arguments Wednesday, attorneys for the city said developer Phil Tagami and corporate partner Insight Terminal Solutions failed to meet key deadlines in the construction of a large marine terminal that would ship bulk goods at the former Army Base in West Oakland. Tagami, however, contends that the city intentionally stalled the project in order to prevent the transport of coal through the harbor -- having failed once before to ban coal from passing through Oakland altogether. The pollutant has proven to be politically toxic in Oakland. Environmental advocates have warned for years that coal dust mixed with the open air could worsen West Oakland's air quality. The ensuing legal and public fight has put construction of the terminal on hold since it was first approved about a decade ago. The city knew that its contracts with the plaintiffs in applicable federal law allowed the plaintiffs to (ship) coal, said Tagami's lawyer, Barry Lee. For political -- rather than legal -- reasons, city leaders refused to accept that outcome. With the eight-week trial now wrapped, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Nol Wise will make a ruling in the coming weeks after assessing a complicated timeline of contract negotiations, agreements and delays. The key arguments rest on the idea of force majeure, a common legal clause in contracts that prevents either party from being held liable when a sudden event -- such as a change in the law -- interrupts the agreement. Danielle Leonard, an outside counsel representing the city, said Wednesday that Tagami lagged behind on building the terminal because he was hunting for a sublease that could subsidize some construction costs. She cited testimony from former Mayor Libby Schaaf and other city officials, who said during the trial that they wanted to see the project move forward. There is simply no evidence of a city political conspiracy to block the terminal, Leonard said, because that is simply not what happened. She added later that the delay was due to Tagami's economic self-interest. Judge Wise will consider an exhaustive set of evidence that shapes the timeline of how the contract fell apart, along with the two sides' wildly different characterizations of the documents. At one point, the two sides disagreed whether some railway improvements made by Tagami's team indicated that he was trying to reach his milestones, or if that bit of infrastructure was irrelevant to the original development agreement. The terminal in question, if it is ever built, would store bulk commodities that arrive by rail from Utah -- where the state legislature has dished out 53 million for the Oakland coal project -- before shipping them overseas. The facility would only store coal, and not burn it, but environmentalists have pressured Oakland to divest entirely from the pollutive industry. A study in Richmond this year found that rail conveyance of coal increased the number of fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5, in the atmosphere because of how coal dust mixes into the air. Emergency room visits or hospitalizations for asthma, meanwhile, are two times higher in West Oakland than the rest of Alameda County, according to a 2018 county study, which activists have ascribed to poor air quality. The larger issue of whether Tagami can ship coal was already decided in 2020 when a court determined the city had not provided enough evidence to ban the transport of coal over health concerns. And while the latest lawsuit centers around the technical details of a contract dispute, its larger implications could effectively determine the future of coal in Oakland -- a focal point of the closing argument by Tagami's attorney. The city simply said, 'You are not going build this terminal, Lee said, 'because we know once you build it, coal could be handled -- and that is politically unacceptable.'",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A judge will make a ruling in the coming weeks after assessing a complicated timeline of contract negotiations, agreements and delays. Environmental advocates have warned for years that coal dust mixed with the open air could worsen West Oakland's air quality. The ensuing legal and public fight has put construction of the terminal on hold since it was first approved about a decade ago. The city knew that its contracts with the plaintiffs in applicable federal law allowed the plaintiffs to (ship) coal, said Tagami's lawyer, Barry Lee."

At its last stop, near the Chinese border, brand-new residential towers rise out of the jungle. China funded much of the glistening new infrastructure that has transformed this landlocked country of 7.5 million people. The building boom showcases the kind of modernity China says it can offer the world, notably the high-speed Laos-China railway that in a feat of engineering transformed a two-day journey across the country into a sleek three-hour trip. The line was built by Chinese engineers to Chinese rail standards, allowing it to connect to China's high-speed network. But Laos is also an economy in distress. Inflation rose to more than 41 percent at its peak this spring. The Laotian kip has depreciated more than 43 percent against the YOU.S. dollar. In a country where virtually everything is imported, the statistics translate into sacrifice: farmers who can no longer afford fertilizer, children who have dropped out of school to work and families cutting back on health care. The China-led strategy was meant to protect Laos from these shocks -- instead, it led to them. Laos is struggling to repay the billions it borrowed from China to fund the hydroelectric dams, trains and highways, which have drained the country of foreign reserves. As repayments drag, external debt is rising, a vulnerability exacerbated by the pandemic and rising global fuel and food prices. The AidData research lab at William  Mary, which tracks China's lending, calculates Laos's total debt to China over an 18-year period starting in 2000 to be at 12.2 billion -- about 65 percent of gross domestic product. Add in loans from other agencies and countries, and Laos's debt stands at more than 120 percent, according to AidData. There is no country in the world with a higher amount of debt exposure to China than Laos. It is a very, very extreme example, said Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. Laos went on a borrowing spree and got in over its head. Laos has had to make compromises, including on its own sovereignty, to appease Beijing and seek some financial forbearance, allowing Chinese security agents and police to operate in the country as Beijing extends its repression beyond its borders, according to human rights groups and Lao activists. The Laotian electrical grid is now partly controlled by China, in what analysts believe is a trade-off in lieu of debt repayments. A Chinese company provides security for the new train line. China also faces difficult choices. It cannot let Laos default, as Beijing's regional strategy rests on success here. The rail line cutting through Laos is intended to extend into Thailand and Malaysia, and then Singapore, creating a network at the heart of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's ambitions. Laos is also one of the few relative success stories for China, at a time where its Belt and Road Initiative is shrinking or being reevaluated elsewhere, forcing Beijing to focus on its most strategic goals -- integrating its closest neighbors among them. Laos is the ticket to be closer to Southeast Asia, said Toshiro Nishizawa, a professor at the University of Tokyo who specializes in economic and development policy and has advised the government of Laos. Beijing has so far been very generous by allowing Laos to defer payments, Nishizawa added, but it cannot postpone the problem indefinitely. Debt forgiveness to countries like Laos will also open up China to similar requests from governments around the globe. Beijing has loaned almost 1 trillion to developing nations in the past two decades, a mammoth amount that has fundamentally reshaped China's position in the world. We are now getting acquainted with China as the world's largest debt collector, said Parks at AidData, something that is uncharted territory for both the borrowers and China. It is challenging not to let this affect your diplomatic relations, Parks said. The Laotian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for the Laos-China Railway Company Ltd. referred questions to the Laos Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Laos and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent via email and fax. Riding the new Chinese-built high-speed rail from Vientiane, the capital, to Boten, and then back down to the tranquil tourist town of Luang Prabang, revealed a landlocked country torn between a recognition of its limitations -- no progress would have been possible without China -- and deeply anxious about its reliance on Beijing. Lao people have begun to express unprecedented discontent online, targeted at China and their own government, rare in a one-party socialist state where critics are harassed and even disappeared. Lao on social media most recently expressed outrage at reports in late August that a Chinese mining company had detained some 50 villagers for illegally digging gold in a part of northern Laos where the company held a concession and demanded a ransom for their release. Laos is so indebted to China that the Chinese can come over here and take our land, said Nin, a 23-year-old vegetable and condiments seller at a local market in Vientiane, who like other Lao spoke on the condition of anonymity or only with their first name for fear of retribution. Chinese companies, she said, can use Lao workers however they please. Surveys show a remarkable shift in sentiment away from China to other Asian and Western nations -- most surprisingly to the United States, which rained some 270 million cluster bombs down on Laos during a covert campaign in tandem with the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. This year's State of Southeast Asia survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore saw a majority of respondents from Laos, almost 60 percent, say they would prefer the region to align with the United States over China, a sharp reversal from the previous year's survey. A growing number of respondents, more than 72 percent, also indicated they were worried about China's economic influence. When Laos developed a vision for itself as the battery of Asia, hoping to export electricity primarily generated by hydropower, it looked north to China for support. Chinese companies arrived to build dams and supporting infrastructure. Other Chinese businesses followed, making large-scale investments in mining, agriculture and telecommunications. In 2013, China became the largest foreign investor in Laos with some 5 billion spread across 745 projects, overtaking Thailand. The high-speed railway from the Laotian capital of Vientiane to the border town of Boten and then into Yunnan province in China became the signature project in this new relationship, despite warnings from economists about the debt Laos was taking on to build it. The commercial rationale for the railway was also weak, according to a report by the Asian Development Bank, with costs outweighing benefits even if the line eventually connected to Malaysia and Singapore. Seventy-five tunnels, 167 bridges and 6 billion later, the single-track railway opened in December 2021. Chinese state media made a special effort to highlight one of the most challenging technical aspects of constructing the railway: clearing unexploded ordnance left behind by the United States during its bombing campaign. A columnist from the Chinese state-run Global Times later declared that the US dropped bombs in Laos, while China builds railways. Covid restrictions were still in place in Beijing at the time of the opening, forcing Xi to officiate remotely. With the railway, the mountain from Kunming to Vientiane is no longer high and the road is no longer long, Xi said in a speech telecast by video link to a room full of Lao officials. A beaming Lao President Thongloun Sisoulith responded that his country had finally realized its dream of building a rail connection to its powerful neighbor and beyond. Two-way cross-border passenger services between Laos and China started in April. On a recent morning outside the Vientiane station -- a structure more imposing than the capital's airport -- visibly excited passengers extended their selfie sticks for photos. Still, it is not passenger travel that will reap benefits for Laos, analysts say, but freight -- and so far that has largely traveled in one direction, with goods exported from China coming into Laos and then on to Thailand. Only a few companies in Laos have been using the link to export products to China, and they have been almost exclusively Chinese, business executives say. As an Australian company, we have not seen the benefits, said one executive in Laos, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Only companies connected to the Chinese and Lao investors in the project appear to be able to get access, and without those connections, it is almost impossible to utilize the rail, the executive added. The Laotian government said it expects the railway, a 70-30 joint venture between Chinese state-owned companies and a Laotian one, to be profitable by 2026. But the parent company, which has no revenue other than that generated by the railway, has to not only be profitable but also pay back the 3.54 billion loan it obtained from the state-run Export-Import Bank of China. If the railway revenues are insufficient ... it is ambiguous who would bail that company out, Parks said. It is a phantom menace for Laos: They do not know whether they are going to be responsible for a small part of this debt, a big part or none at all. The crowd on the train had thinned by the time it pulled into the last station on the Laos side of the border. The town of Boten in the early 2000s was transformed by a private Hong Kong-based company from a remote outpost on Laos's northern fringe to a casino boomtown. Tourists from China, and also from other parts of Laos and neighboring Thailand, flocked to its nightclubs and gambling dens. Boten was designated as a special economic zone with a major casino as its centerpiece business. Built largely for Chinese visitors, for whom gambling is illegal back home, the town soon devolved into lawlessness. The Chinese government, in response, cut off electricity and telecommunication services to the zone, which came from neighboring Yunnan. The casino was forced to shut. Decay set in. Paint began peeling off the pink and yellow buildings. The Belt and Road Initiative offered Boten a new lease on life as the first stop in Beijing's plans to economically and physically integrate its neighbors. The special economic zone was rebranded from Boten Golden City, its moniker as a gambling destination, to Boten Beautiful Land. Haicheng Holdings, a private Yunnan-based developer, started to build residential buildings and schools in the town, hoping for a rush of Chinese migrants following the expected boom. Advertisements in Haicheng's showroom feature multiple photos of Xi with Lao officials calling Boten a pilot zone for deepening regional cooperation. Outside the marbled showroom, the reality of Boten bears little resemblance to Haicheng's gilded model city, and the marketing has done little to she would its unsavory past. The zone is devoid of the kind of suited businesspeople and bustling factories it claims to attract, or even tourists. Instead, Boten's few thousand residents are overwhelmingly Chinese workers building new residential towers and those working in services catering to them -- Chinese restaurants, Chinese shops and brothels. Private security guards with Chinese flags on their flak jackets police the area. Virtually no shops are run or owned by Lao. Businesses almost exclusively accept Chinese yuan rather than local currency. Steaming hot pot, barbecued meats and noodles in lava-red soup are featured here over Lao dishes like sticky rice and laab. By night, young women sit outside brothels bathed in purple and pink neon lights, while their handlers try to cajole Chinese men walking outside to come in. Phet, 32, is one of the few remaining Lao shopkeepers in the zone, running a small convenience store that sells snacks and Lao food made in a tiny back kitchen. He said he saw an initial rush of people when the train first opened, but business has since died down. The train has allowed Chinese visitors to bypass Boten, going directly on to Vientiane or Luang Prabang and returning to China without again getting off. Most difficult of all: Phet's landlord accepts rent only in Chinese yuan; with the devalued Lao kip, the cost of running his business has skyrocketed. Chinese bosses are so much stricter than Lao bosses, he said. We have no ability to negotiate with them. We cannot talk to them. Soutchai Phouthivong, 60, has driven a songthaew -- a pickup truck that functions as a shared taxi -- since the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge opened in 1994, ferrying people from the immigration checkpoint near Vientiane to Thai malls and restaurants in Nong Khai. Lao, particularly lower-income families who do not have cars, are his main customers. His income, he said, has fallen by more than half this year. Look, it is now almost noon and there are no Lao people around, Phouthivong said on a recent Wednesday. I am lucky to do one or two trips a day. What was once a routine trip for many Lao -- to seek medical treatment, buy goods that they cannot find at home or simply enjoy a weekend outing -- has become unaffordable because of the falling Lao currency and inflation. In Vientiane, prices are soaring for basics. A 52-year-old seller of dry goods said the noodles have tripled in price, turning from a staple to a luxury. Sonesavanh, a 46-year-old whose husband has depression, has turned to Buddhist healing, seeking blessings from monks and trying to improve their luck by rearranging furniture, because the medical treatment he needs in Thailand is now unaffordable. It is like a race between the economy and my husband, to see which one will get better first, she said. Discontent with both China and the Laotian government have melded together at this point, said Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations who wrote in April about popular unrest in Laos. It has turned into a generalized anger at China overall. You do not see that anger at other partners critical to Laos, like Thailand and Vietnam. In March 2022, Anousa Luangsuphom, 25 -- an activist widely known as Jack in Laos -- launched a Facebook page called The Power of the Keyboard, using satire and memes to criticize both his government and China's reach into his country. He also called for the end of one-party rule in Laos. On April 29, Jack changed his Facebook profile picture to one bearing the motto Fighting for Laos' survival, so we do not become China's slave. He then went about his day -- serving khao piak sen, a Lao noodle soup dish, at the shop he worked in, before meeting friends at a coffee shop and bar. That evening, a man entered the bar and asked in a few words of Lao if Jack was around. He briefly exited before returning and shooting Jack in the face and chest. I did not know what had happened to me, Jack said in an interview, his first since the attack. I just heard people calling my name. Jack was initially treated in a Laotian government hospital, before the Manushya Foundation, a human rights group, organized his medical evacuation. Doctors outside of Laos worked to reconstruct his jaw, but they predicted he would not regain speech for a year because of the extensive damage. Now in a safe location, Jack is relearning basic functions. He has difficulty chewing, and while he can speak, he struggles to articulate his words. He habitually touches the circle-shaped scar to the right of his lips, where the bullet entered his cheek. Jack does not know who shot him; he also has not been able to look at the video of his shooting, which was widely shared on Lao social media. All he does know is that the day he was shot, he had explicitly posted about what he called China's monopoly over Laos, which he described in an interview as tantamount to an invasion. Jack is trying to rebuild his life, helping activists get better at social media while waiting for more surgeries to fix his jaw and fully restore his speech. But Jack has stopped saying anything negative online about the Chinese government, or Chinese-linked projects in Laos. In the months following his shooting, two Chinese dissidents -- free-speech activist Yang Zewei, also known as Qiao Xinxin, and prominent human rights lawyer Lu Siwei -- were taken into custody in Laos. Yang resurfaced more than two months later in a Chinese detention center and has been charged with subversion of state power. Lu was deported to China in mid-September, despite pressure from Western governments and the United Nations to release him and allow him to travel to the United States, where his wife and daughter resettled last year. Lu had a YOU.S. visa. In a statement on October 11, the State Department condemned Lu's forced repatriation, which it said was at the request of Chinese authorities. Jack's fear now is that China's growing transnational policing will ensnare him, too. I did not realize that talking about China would get me shot, Jack said. I did not realize that talking about China is more dangerous than talking about the Lao government.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"China funded much of the glistening new infrastructure that has transformed Laos.

Please try again later verifyErrors  The Department of Labor launched inquiries into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after reports of children's grueling working conditions at the companies' plants surfaced. There are currently US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division investigations open at Perdue and Tyson Foods. No additional details can be provided as the investigations are ongoing, a Labor Department spokesperson told CBS News. The federal probe into the poultry producers comes after a bombshell report published in New York Times Magazine that zeroed in on the disturbing details of a 14-year-old boy who came from Guatemala to Virginia in order to support his family by working the overnight shifts at a Perdue plant. His arm was nearly torn off while working at a slaughterhouse, the article reported. The article also documented other cases of children conducting similar work at the Perdue plant, as well as at a nearby Tyson plant. These two companies produce one in three pounds of poultry consumed in the US, the article stated. Federal law restricts individuals under age 16 from working certain hours, and prohibits minors from working in meat processing plants due to the hazardous conditions. The Independent has reached out to the Department of Labor, Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms. A spokesperson for Perdue told CBS News that the company was appalled by the illegal child labour claims. We take the legal employment and safety of each individual working in our facilities very seriously and have strict, longstanding policies in place for Perdue associates to prevent minors from working hazardous jobs in violation of the law, the spokesperson said. We recognize the systemic nature of this issue and embrace any role we can play in a solution. Tyson, however, told the outlet that it had not been made aware of an investigation, so the company did not offer a comment. The NYT Magazine article reported that the poultry producers used contractors to hire cleaning staff -- a way to circumvent accountability for skirting child labour laws. One food sanitation contractor recently was forced to pay a 1.5 million penalty for employing over 100 children to work the overnight shifts at meat processing plants across the country, a Department of Labor investigation found in February. The chief legal officer for the Department of Labor, Seema Nanda, told the New York Times the Biden administration is now looking into whether the larger companies can be held responsible. We are long past the day when brands can say that they do not know that they have child labor in their supply chain, Ms Nanda said. The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Department of Labor launched inquiries into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after reports of children's grueling working conditions at the companies' plants surfaced.

It reminds us that barbaric aggressors have no human compassion and are driven by an insatiable appetite for theft and atrocities. It is worth remembering that about a century ago, in the short span of five years, the Armenians experienced the beginning of the Genocide of 1915, the rebirth from the ashes at Sardarabad and the cruel division of our hope by the Turks and Soviet Russians. In 1988, the horrific earthquake occurred, followed by the brutal deportations of Armenians from Baku, only to be followed by the Artsakh liberation movement and the independence of Armenia -- all within three years. Sometimes we are forced to postpone the full cycle of mourning in order to take advantage of an opportunity or prevent further losses. It is surreal to internalize that we have just witnessed what was considered unthinkable in our conscious reality. Our position can and has changed quickly -- from humiliation to optimism and the inverse. It is never as hopeless as we may feel during difficult times and never as positive as we may believe during hopeful times. We must be ever cautious and self serving. Our experiences in Artsakh over the last 30 years teach us that painful lesson. Given the calamitous tragedies that have been our history, it is important to avoid wild swings in our emotions. This is where leadership earns its credibility, whether it is religious, political or social in nature. Leadership helps us avoid the peaks and valleys that can leave us damaged. The prevailing view in our communities is that the loss of Artsakh will not satisfy the genocidal motivations of criminal Azerbaijan. Armenians are living in fear today, as they have lost hope in their leaders and other nations. Is our sovereignty as a nation state the next chapter? Are we simply waiting for the enemy? The Azeris are coy but uncomplicated. They usually telegraph their next exploits. While the Europeans and United States issued statements of concern and diplomatic consequences, the Azeris ignored civility by amassing troops on the border before their assault on Artsakh last month. War games were organized with their complicit genocidal cousins prior to the 2020 war. With the blood still fresh from occupied Artsakh and the deported residents seeking a new life, Aliyev, emboldened by a lack of military and diplomatic resistance, now speaks of demanding eight enclaves, while he audaciously occupies 145 km of sovereign Armenian territory, holds POWs from 2020 and arrests the leaders of Artsakh. When there is little substantive opposition from foreign powers, he is free to demand almost anything. Even though Azerbaijan has committed genocide and numerous other criminal acts, the Europeans have not sanctioned Azerbaijan, because Azeri energy is more important than their often-stated principles of human rights, freedom and the rule of law. The United States has not even been able to end the waiver of section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Regardless of the quantity of weapons shipped, it is a clear statement of values when they pander to a terrorist state. The relationship with Israel is also a major variable. The current war with the Palestinians has heightened the wall between Iran and the West, particularly the United States. Despite the despicable Azeri-Israeli arrangement of energy and spy presence in return for billions in military hardware used to kill Armenians, the YOU.S. is not expected to sanction Azerbaijan. The YOU.S. may be motivated to outflank the Russians in the Caucasus, but apparently not at the expense of rogue Azerbaijan. In addition, Aliyev continues to rant about the Zangezur Corridor. Imagine the arrogance of two nations, Azerbaijan and Turkey, demanding a sovereign corridor to connect their stolen land that would unite the Turkish criminals and would severely wound Armenia. Despite the outrageous nature of their demand, it is considered one of the prime motivators for conflict in the Syunik region. Recently, there have been sources, one Iranian and the other Azeri, suggesting that Azerbaijan is considering a Plan B to Zangezur due to Armenian opposition. The Pashinyan government has consistently stated that there was never such an agreement in the trilateral statement of November 2020 and that Armenia would never accept such a concept. For its part, Russia has also stated that such an agreement does not exist. Given Russia's duplicitous politics towards Armenia, this should not be considered a reliable commitment for Armenia. The Plan B is a rail and land link on the Iranian side of the Armenian border. This plan is not a sovereign Azeri corridor and would be subject to the normal border and customs controls of the host nation. Iran seems to be offering this as an alternative to protect their interests in any territorial changes. Some sources believe Azerbaijan may find favor with this. Do not believe a word of this. Azerbaijan wants the Zangezur corridor for two reasons: to establish a land route to connect Turkey, Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan and to destroy Armenian sovereignty. Plan B does not address the latter. They also want at least the eastern shore of Lake Sevan. In this sea of chaos, two conclusions can be drawn: Azerbaijan will attack, and Armenia should not expect much military support from the western defenders of democracy. In light of the ominous clouds coming from the east, what should Armenia do to thwart such a challenge? As a baseline position, Armenia should continue bilateral talks with both Turkey on normalization and with Azerbaijan on a peace agenda. Let us not fool ourselves. The Turks and Azeris are looking for capitulation and destruction of our sovereign state, but negotiating can serve as a small deterrent with Russian, YOU.S. and European sponsorship. The best case scenario is that Azerbaijan will continue to be uncooperative, which could strengthen the Armenian position. The European organizers must have been annoyed with the Aliyev boycott of the recent Granada sideline discussion. Armenia's presence prevented a total embarrassment, but certainly not enough to overcome Europe's energy obsession. Talk of sanctions by members of the European Parliament should not raise optimism on the Armenian side. The Americans have had similar rumbling, but Congress is not in a position to pass binding legislation, and the State Department will only serve as a mediator. After publicly criticizing Armenia, the Russians have signaled that they may be willing to sponsor another round of trilateral talks. Of course, this type of gamesmanship should be expected, as the Russians will alternate short-term tactical positions to serve the longer term interest of controlling their backyard. The high volume of diplomatic engagement by the Armenian government may yet yield a defensive option. Whether motivated by self interest or a latent guilt complex, the West has offered several options to Armenia with onsite presence. The Artsakh disaster has Armenia flooded with European observers (increased and renewed), USAID personnel, a variety of diplomatic missions and other Western interests. Argentina has also offered onsite white helmet support to promote humanitarian needs and support. The military defense mechanisms to defend the homeland have been slow in developing. France has strongly hinted at providing military aid after a visit by a top official, but the content and timing is unclear. Deals have been announced with India, but again with uncertain timing. In an absurd irony, Russia maintains a military presence in Armenia, yet it has denied CSTO support several times in violation of the defense pact and has criticized Armenia's Western engagement. Russia clearly cannot be trusted to support Armenia, but it is still dangerous as the only regional power that can greenlight the Azeris. The YOU.N. Mission to Artsakh was a farce and insulting, as it was limited to an Azeri-controlled tour and foolishly declared no evidence of civilian targeting. This is comparable to allowing the criminal to guide investigators through the crime scene. It is another example of how the YOU.N., in the interest of remaining a global facade, has rendered itself ineffective. Perhaps the best option for Armenia is to invite as many foreign missions on the ground, particularly on the eastern front, as possible. The European and American presence could serve as a deterrent to Azeri military action. I do not think the Europeans and Americans will be as forgiving to the Azeris as the Russians were when their peacekeepers were murdered by the Azeris. Fortifying the defenses militarily goes without saying, but a physical presence of humanitarian, military attachs and consulate presence in Syunik might slow the Azeris down long enough to build a stronger defense. This is not a time to say no to any legitimate foreign presence that can further the short-term humanitarian and intermediate-term security issues in the homeland. On the contrary, we should be recruiting physical presence.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Armenian nation is not allowed the proper time to absorb the tragedy of Artsakh, says Hrant Dink.

This is the second major derailment accident after the Balasore train accident. AAP leader Sandeep Pathak said that the budget for railway safety was cut short and funds were not fully utilised. Report about fault in tracks is nothing new. Majority of the rail track network in our country is old and need replacement. Even the CAG report has pointed this out, the senior leader further stated, who is also a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge demanded that accountability of the Railway Ministry and the Central government be fixed. This is the second major derailment accident after the Balasore train accident of June 2023. Accountability of the Railway Ministry and the Central Government should be fixed, he said in a post in Hindi on X. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, Recurring train accidents and resultant death toll is yet another area of BJP govt's glaring failure. High flying promises lie shattered.

The failure of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to visit the site speaks volumes about the arrogance of the political class in Bihar, Kishor told reporters when asked about the accident.

It highlights the vicious cycle between disasters and inequality - which WMO and partners are trying to repair through the Early Warnings for All initiative. Inequality and disaster vulnerability are two sides of the same coin: unequal access to services, such as finance and insurance, leaves the most at risk exposed to the danger of disasters; while disaster impacts exacerbate inequalities and push the most at risk further into poverty. 2023 has shattered temperature records, and seen record drought, fire and floods around the world. Poverty and inequality are exacerbating these disasters, says UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres in a message. Those with least are often at greatest risk from extreme weather. They may live in places that are more susceptible to flooding and drought; and they have fewer resources to deal with damage and to recover from it. They suffer disproportionately as a result, and may be pushed further into poverty, he says. The statistics speak for themselves. And these statistics have injected a sense of urgency into the international campaign, spearheaded by Mr Guterres, to ensure that life-saving early warnings reach everyone on the planet by the end of 2027. The Early Warnings for All initiative is being rolled out in an initial subset of 30 countries which are most vulnerable to extreme weather and climate change impacts. People living in these countries bear little blame for greenhouse gas emissions, but are bearing a disproportionate burden from the resulting climate change, says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. Early warnings for all can help bridge the gap in equality by ensuring that vulnerable and marginalized populations receive timely information and assistance, reducing the disproportionate impact disasters often have on these communities. In the coming year we will ramp up our support to countries through our regional specialized centres and by meeting priority needs identified in countries through funding mechanisms such as the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems initiative, the Systematic Observations Financing Facility and through our collaboration with the Green Climate Fund and other partners, says Prof. Taalas. Inclusivity is an integral part of the Early Warnings for ALL, ensuring that the messages reach all segments of the population, regardless of socioeconomic status, language, or physical abilities. This ensures that vulnerable groups, such as low-income communities, people with disabilities, are not left behind in receiving critical information. Addressing the intertwining challenges of disaster impact and societal inequality necessitates: International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction takes place every year on 13 October. It is spearheaded by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. UNDRR released a new Global Survey on Persons with Disabilities and Disasters. It showed there had been no progress in helping people cope since the last survey one decade ago. This is damning evidence of an unacceptable lack of progress which is leaving people behind. Persons with disabilities must be protected from disasters and this is ever more urgent with the increase in catastrophic climate-related disasters around the world, said Ms. Mami Mizutori, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Head of UNDRR. UNDRR and WMO are leading the Early Warnings for All initiative, along with the International Telecommunications Union and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and a growing number of partners.

Awareness to the bedbug crisis was first raised last week as it emerged the French were experiencing a 'living hell' fighting off a plague of the insects that feed on the blood of animals and humans. But this week, Sadiq Khan warned that the possibility of bedbugs on London's public transport was a 'real source of concern' and that he had contacted officials in Paris after the French capital became overwhelmed by an outbreak with the insects reported in schools, trains, hospitals and cinemas. Now, a pest control company which operates in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and London has said that staff are facing 25 call-outs a week, which is up from just 'one or two' a month ago. Luton is a particular hotspot for bedbugs at the moment, with residents throwing their beds away, ripping up carpets and evacuating their homes.

What are bedbugs, how do they spread and how do you get rid of them? Bedbugs are oval-shaped insects with six legs that can reach up to 7mm in lengthThe parasites originated in the Middle East and have been around for at least 3,550 yearsThey feed on blood and their bites can leave skin rashes and because allergic reactionsDespite their Latin name being Cimex lectularius which means 'bug of the bed', the insects can be found in many hidden crevices such as sofas and cushions as these are safe places to lay their eggsThe pests can live for several months without a blood meal, meaning they can linger in furniture and suitcases for long after their last biteCommon signs you might have bedbugs include: Rusty or reddish smears on your sheets, dark spotting from dried bedbug fecal matter, a musty smell in your roomBedbugs can spread via light switches and electrical outlets and be brought into homes by latching on to luggageWhile bedbugs because itching and a lack of sleep, they are not known to spread disease and bites normally clear up within two weeksExperts recommend not unpacking clothes when staying in hotels and keeping luggage off the floor and zipped upTo get rid of bedbugs, experts recommend washing bedding and clothing on a 60C cycle or packing it in a plastic bag and leaving it in the freezer for three or four days Advertisement It said: 'The national bed bug problem has not missed Luton. The Pest Control Service is currently receiving an alarming number of bed bug jobs on a weekly basis.' Adam Warren, director of Summit Pest Control, told The Times that the problem had flared up in the past six weeks and that Luton was 'busier for bedbugs than I have ever known it'. As the company face a busy time of year, they said the worst infestation was in the affluent village of Radlett, Hertfordshire, where an elderly couple's house was so infested they had to rip out the carpets and throw the beds away. The Times also spoke to Jamie Ramsey, manager of Pests of London, who said they were 'snowed under' with bedbug call-outs at the moment. They serve areas within the M25. The company's call-outs have doubled since last year to around five to ten a day - many from hotels concerned that guests were bringing them to rooms. A third firm, Pest Extractors, said they have seen a recent spike too - not just in Luton but all over, including Stevenage, another hotspot. The spike comes as it has also emerged that insurers will not pay out over bedbug infestations. Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, and other firms who provide home cover have confirmed the cost of removing bedbugs or repairing damage is not included in most policies. The Association of British Insurers urged customers to look if there was any additional cover they could get as fears grow over an infestation. Cover is likely to vary between home insurance policies, with many not covering the cost of damage caused by vermin and pests,' a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'The costs of disinfestation might be covered under some add-ons to cover, like emergency home assistance. So, the advice on this is to check the cover provided under your policy.' Aviva said its standard home insurance policies exclude 'moths, vermin, insects, fungus, damp, rust, wet or dry rot'. Admiral said it also excluded damage and that its Home Emergency add-on would not cover bedbugs. Axa also said it would not cover bedbugs.

One rugby fan told MailOnline she plans to 'actively avoid' sitting on public transport and has started having 'nightmares' about bedbugs after watching videos of the critters on social media. Nic Shacklock from Online-Bedrooms said: 'It is estimated over a million fans are heading to the Rugby Village. 'If everyone is using public transport while Paris is gripped by a bed bug infestation, it is more than likely an outbreak is heading to our shores.' He added: 'It is worth placing bin bags or thick plastic bags on seats while using the Metro as they do not like to cling onto smooth plastic materials. 'We also advise being cautious when you arrive at the hotel room. Check under your bed sheets and strip the entire room as the bugs can be hiding within the mattress and on the sofa.' Professor Lucy Easthope, who has worked on the response to global events including the 911 and 77 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and Covid-19, has warned that Britain is 'not ready' for an invasion of bedbugs. The French government is battling to contain a bout of nationwide panic, with several secondary schools closing due to the infestation. Footage shows residents walking past discarded mattresses in one of the streets in Marseille and Lyon, with some of the items lying in the road and others propped up against buildings. Locals are also chucking out their home furnishings because of the issue, with a placard reading 'bedbugs' pinned to the headboard of a bed to warn others not to take it.

But some experts have disputed whether the creature is indeed a bedbug, with one saying it was not 'flat enough' and another saying that the clip 'looks wrong.' Mr Khan said he was concerned, but TfL was doing everything it could to ensure the bedbug infestation in France does not spread to public transport in London. He told PoliticsJOE: 'This is a real source of concern, right? People are worried about these bugs in Paris causing a problem in London. 'I was in contact with TfL last week and this weekend. We are taking steps to make sure we do not have those problems in London, in relation to regular cleaning of not just the Tubes and our buses, but talking to the Eurostar as well. 'TfL have one of the best regimes to clean our assets on a nightly basis. We are speaking to our friends in Paris to see if there are any lessons to be learned. For a variety of reasons we do not think those issues will arise in London - but no complacency from TfL.' TfL has confirmed that it is monitoring trains and buses for any indication that the infestation could have reached the UK. A TfL spokesman said: 'We are continuing to closely monitor our network but are not aware of any outbreaks in London. 'We are continuing to implement our rigorous and thorough cleaning measures that have been proven to keep both the interior and exterior of our trains clean.

For some, their bites are uncomfortable, showing up on skin as itchy red bumps as they feast on human and animal blood. Mr Grimes said that bed bugs have 'a reddish-brown, flat, oval bodies and leave itchy bites that are either in a line or clusters.' He recommends that Brits remove the clutter from their homes and avoid storing items on the floor. The pest expert said that those struggling with an infestation should wash bedding and clothing at a high temperature. 'Bed bugs and their eggs cannot survive at temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius, so high temperature washes and tumble drying for at least 30 minutes can help to kill them off,' said Mr Grimes. Rik Smith, director of tenancy services at Goodlord, has also issued a series of tips to tenants worried about their bugs - ranging from the extreme to the bizarre. If you are concerned that you may have brought the bugs into the house, Mr Smith says you should 'put affected clothes and bedding in the freezer for a few hours before washing'. You should also take steps to 'wash bedding and clothes on a hot wash (at least 60C) and tumble dry on a hot setting for 30 minutes'. When that is done, it is important to hoover the house thoroughly and empty the bag - as the bugs may still be alive in there.

READ MORE: Bedbug infestation is 'getting worse' with pest-control experts 'busier than ever' - but insurers 'will not pay out to cover cost of removing them or repairing damage' Advertisement A third firm, Pest Extractors, said they have seen a recent spike too - not just in Luton but all over, including Stevenage, another hotspot. The spike comes as it has also emerged that insurers will not pay out over bedbug infestations. Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, and other firms who provide home cover have confirmed the cost of removing bedbugs or repairing damage is not included in most policies. The Association of British Insurers urged customers to look if there was any additional cover they could get as fears grow over an infestation. Cover is likely to vary between home insurance policies, with many not covering the cost of damage caused by vermin and pests,' a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'The costs of disinfestation might be covered under some add-ons to cover, like emergency home assistance. So, the advice on this is to check the cover provided under your policy.' Aviva said its standard home insurance policies exclude 'moths, vermin, insects, fungus, damp, rust, wet or dry rot'. Admiral said it also excluded damage and that its Home Emergency add-on would not cover bedbugs. Axa also said it would not cover bedbugs. Transport for London (TfL) has begun disinfecting Tube seats on a daily basis to stop infestations. Britons have been sharing several videos of suspected bedbugs on social media as fears grow Video shows a backstreet in Marseille filled with home furnishings abandoned during the crisis But experts fear Brits heading to Marseille for England's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Fiji on Sunday could bring the insects back with them. One rugby fan told MailOnline she plans to 'actively avoid' sitting on public transport and has started having 'nightmares' about bedbugs after watching videos of the critters on social media. Nic Shacklock from Online-Bedrooms said: 'It is estimated over a million fans are heading to the Rugby Village. 'If everyone is using public transport while Paris is gripped by a bed bug infestation, it is more than likely an outbreak is heading to our shores.' What are bedbugs, how do they spread and how do you get rid of them? Bedbugs are oval-shaped insects with six legs that can reach up to 7mm in lengthThe parasites originated in the Middle East and have been around for at least 3,550 yearsThey feed on blood and their bites can leave skin rashes and because allergic reactionsDespite their Latin name being Cimex lectularius which means 'bug of the bed', the insects can be found in many hidden crevices such as sofas and cushions as these are safe places to lay their eggsThe pests can live for several months without a blood meal, meaning they can linger in furniture and suitcases for long after their last biteCommon signs you might have bedbugs include: Rusty or reddish smears on your sheets, dark spotting from dried bedbug fecal matter, a musty smell in your roomBedbugs can spread via light switches and electrical outlets and be brought into homes by latching on to luggageWhile bedbugs because itching and a lack of sleep, they are not known to spread disease and bites normally clear up within two weeksExperts recommend not unpacking clothes when staying in hotels and keeping luggage off the floor and zipped upTo get rid of bedbugs, experts recommend washing bedding and clothing on a 60C cycle or packing it in a plastic bag and leaving it in the freezer for three or four days Advertisement He added: 'It is worth placing bin bags or thick plastic bags on seats while using the Metro as they do not like to cling onto smooth plastic materials. 'We also advise being cautious when you arrive at the hotel room. Check under your bed sheets and strip the entire room as the bugs can be hiding within the mattress and on the sofa.' Professor Lucy Easthope, who has worked on the response to global events including the 911 and 77 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and Covid-19, has warned that Britain is 'not ready' for an invasion of bedbugs. The French government is battling to contain a bout of nationwide panic, with several secondary schools closing due to the infestation. Footage shows residents walking past discarded mattresses in one of the streets in Marseille and Lyon, with some of the items lying in the road and others propped up against buildings. Locals are also chucking out their home furnishings because of the issue, with a placard reading 'bedbugs' pinned to the headboard of a bed to warn others not to take it. Concerns have grown over a bedbug infestation in London after a video went viral over the weekend of what was claimed to be a bedbug on a person's leg on the Victoria line. But some experts have disputed whether the creature is indeed a bedbug, with one saying it was not 'flat enough' and another saying that the clip 'looks wrong.' Mr Khan said he was concerned, but TfL was doing everything it could to ensure the bedbug infestation in France does not spread to public transport in London. He told PoliticsJOE: 'This is a real source of concern, right? People are worried about these bugs in Paris causing a problem in London. 'I was in contact with TfL last week and this weekend. We are taking steps to make sure we do not have those problems in London, in relation to regular cleaning of not just the Tubes and our buses, but talking to the Eurostar as well. 'TfL have one of the best regimes to clean our assets on a nightly basis. We are speaking to our friends in Paris to see if there are any lessons to be learned. For a variety of reasons we do not think those issues will arise in London - but no complacency from TfL.' TfL has confirmed that it is monitoring trains and buses for any indication that the infestation could have reached the UK. The entrance to the UGC Odeon cinema, where a worker claims to have found bedbugs, in Paris A TfL spokesman said: 'We are continuing to closely monitor our network but are not aware of any outbreaks in London. 'We are continuing to implement our rigorous and thorough cleaning measures that have been proven to keep both the interior and exterior of our trains clean. 'We are committed to providing a clean and safe environment on our bus, Tube and rail service for our customers and staff, and we would like to reassure our customers that we continue to maintain our already high standards of cleanliness, so our staff and customers can use the network safely and with confidence.' QA What is the problem? Bedbugs are no strangers to the UK but there have been concerns about sightings in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Pest control firm Rentokil says infestations have soared 65 per cent over the past year. Why is Luton affected? The Bedfordshire town, as with London and Manchester, is a major international transport hub. Planes fly to French cities including Paris, the epicentre of an outbreak, Lyon and Nice. Luton is also within the London commuter belt. How is France hit? Scenes of discarded mattresses around Paris indicate the scale of the issue. There are also reports of infestations in seats and soft furnishings in public buildings and mass transport systems. MP Mathilde Panot recently took a test tube filled with dead bedbugs into the Paris parliament to highlight the problem in 'hospitals, schools, workplaces, retirement homes, prisons, trains and cinema theatres'. What can we do? Bedbugs are difficult to have removed. They are so small they can get inside mattresses plus folds in fabrics and clothing. Treating an infestation in a house can cost 600 to 800 for an average three-bed house - though multiple treatments are often needed. The process is also disruptive as beds need to be stripped and wardrobes, drawers and shelves emptied with contents sealed. Occupants also must leave the property. How do I treat bites? These can be uncomfortable and itchy and may lead to swelling but usually not worse - with an extreme and life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, being a rare side-effect. They generally subside after about a week but measures can be taken to reduce discomfort, such as putting a cool, damp cloth on the affected area and avoiding scratching. Antihistamines or a mild steroid cream can also help.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Many fear that bed bugs have made their way over to the UK, as people have spotted them in London, Luton and Manchester.

He stopped and looked at Sheila Katz, one of the Jewish leaders gathered at the White House just four days after Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,300 people in Israel, including young children. You OK, kiddo? he asked, pausing behind a lectern he would been pounding as he described taking his children to see the Nazi death camps. I felt really seen by him, Katz, the CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, recalled in an interview. In that moment, to have the president of the country pause his remarks to check in on me was really moving. Not everyone at the White House is OK these days. Hamas' attack has shaken an administration that feels a deep emotional bond with Israel and the Jewish community. Biden and members of his team -- some of whom have family in Israel -- have been grieving over reports of hostage-takings and mass murder. They are juggling ordinary White House business with a crisis that is anything but, all the while coordinating a response to a war that has upended the Middle East. We are bracing ourselves for what comes next, said a White House aide who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss how colleagues are coping with the war. A White House official working on the response to the attack said that at different times this week, every member of the team has looked at one another teary-eyed. In meetings, people will start speaking and their voices will crack, another official said. Some Biden administration aides have family members or friends who are serving in the Israeli military. As the body count rises, they have been carrying out assignments while texting loved ones to make sure they are safe. We deal with mass casualty events with some amount of frequency on the national security team, a senior official said. But this one has at times felt like more than any one person can bear. It is clear people are carrying their grief with them. Whatever officials may be doing, the war inevitably intrudes. On Tuesday, Biden revealed that YOU.S. citizens are among the hostages taken by Hamas. The next day, the administration said the number of American deaths had climbed to nearly two dozen. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on X horrifying photos of babies murdered and burned by Hamas terrorists, writing that he had shown them to visiting Secretary of State Antony Blinken. An Israeli official said in an interview that the photographs are important, as they make it so much more real to see it. It hurts in your stomach and your gut in such a way that you cannot stay indifferent to it, the official said. It is not in order to persuade. When it comes to anybody who is human and calls himself a human being, you do not need these images to persuade. While the scenes coming out of Israel, including the beginnings of what is expected to be a long, bloody war, hang heavy over the White House, Biden and his aides also appear determined not to let the crisis consume them. Before he addressed Jewish leaders Wednesday, Biden announced a new push to limit junk fees charged by businesses. On Friday, he will travel to Philadelphia for an event devoted to clean energy jobs, and on Monday he will be in Colorado to discuss his economic agenda. Even in the first two days after the attack, Biden was dedicating time to other priorities. Between meetings and phone calls at the White House, he sat for interviews with a special counsel investigating his handling of classified documents from his time as vice president. Behind the scenes, Biden also has taken the time to ask for regular updates about staff members with loved ones living in Israel, an official said. An internal email from White House chief of staff Jeff Zients told staffers about various counseling services available to them and their families. The emotional toll inside the White House has at times spilled into public view. Listening to CNN host Jake Tapper recite the abuses inflicted on Israeli women and children, a polished White House spokesman and retired Navy rear admiral, John Kirby, lost his composure. He turned from the camera to collect himself before answering. Excuse me, Kirby said. Very difficult to look at these images, Jake. Dozens of Jewish aides work in the White House; they are tight-knit. Blinken is Jewish, the stepson of a Holocaust survivor. Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, is also Jewish, and together, the couple hosted a celebration at their residence last month for the High Holy Days. Jewish aides mark religious holidays together and in past years have lit a menorah in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Tom Nides, who left his job as YOU.S. ambassador to Israel in July, said he had just gotten an email from a friend who wrote that his daughter had been found -- dead. It is breaking my heart, Nides said. I know all these people. I know all my staff who are there and their families. It is impossible to describe what is happening in the country. It is beyond comprehension. In the days since Hamas launched its attack, Biden has spoken with a measure of clarity missing in past presidential speeches. The war seems to have energized him, imbuing him with equal parts rage and resolve. At Wednesday's event with Jewish leaders, Biden raised his voice in recalling how he took his children to see the death camps the Nazis built to massacre Jews during World War II. I wanted them to see, he shouted, that you could not not know what was going on walking through those gates! You could not fail to understand as a country what was going on. White House aides said Biden has been deeply involved in crafting the speeches he has delivered this week. In a speech Tuesday, Biden made a point to mention details of the atrocities Hamas committed in breaching Israeli boundary lines. The comments were not part of his original script, aides said. He had just gotten off the phone with Netanyahu, who had told him of women being raped and children being kidnapped and killed. The conversation with Bibi definitely had an effect on him and the way he delivered the speech, an administration official said. Biden, who is Irish Catholic, has ties of his own to Israel and the Jewish diaspora. Biden recalls as a young senator in 1973 visiting then-Prime Minister Golda Meir, who made an indelible impression when she disclosed to him Israel's secret weapon. 'We have no place else to go,' she told him, as Biden has recounted the visit. He feels what the Jewish community has been through, said Ted Kaufman, a former Biden Senate aide and onetime Democratic senator from Delaware. It is the Irish in him. He is someone who feels people's pain. Biden's home state, Delaware, was an incubator for his kinship with the Jewish community. He is close to Congregation Beth Shalom in Wilmington, a synagogue with about 450 families. Michael Beals, the senior rabbi, said he considers the president part of the 'mishpocha,' Yiddish for family network. In the months before Biden became a candidate in the 2020 presidential race, Beals wrote him a letter. At the time, Biden was an ex-vice president whose age was considered a reason he might choose to sit out the race. Beals urged him to run, telling him that in the Jewish tradition, age is an asset -- wisdom -- and you should not count yourself out because of your age. On January 24, 2019, Biden sent back a handwritten letter on vice presidential stationery. You are 'my Rabbi,' and my friend, he wrote. I have had the great honor to meet and be mentored by so many remarkable women and men from 'Golda' Meir to Elie Wiesel, the author and Holocaust survivor. I am indebted to you and to the community in so many ways.

This marks the third consecutive year that CIIE exhibition products have been transported to Shanghai via the China-Europe Freight Train. The Jinbo China-Europe freight train primarily transports exhibition products for the CIIE. The train this year carried mainly cosmetics and mechanical equipment from Fortune Global 500 companies participating in the 6th CIIE, with a total of 70 TEUs and a cargo value exceeding 16 million euros (16.87 million). Departing from Duisburg, Germany, on Sept.21 and passing through Poland, Belarus, Russia, and Kazakhstan, the train entered China through the Alashankou railway port, covering a distance of over 10,000 kilometers in a 20-day journey. Sun Chenghai, deputy director-general of CIIE, said during the reception ceremony that this year's CIIE has achieved record highs in terms of the exhibition area and the number of participating Fortune Global 500 companies and leading industry enterprises. Zhu Yi, vice president of Orient International, one of the companies involved in operating the China-Europe Freight Train, emphasized that the time the China-Europe Freight Train reached Shanghai from Europe is only one-third of sea freight and the transportation cost is significantly lower than air freight. As a flagship brand of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the China-Europe Freight Train offers various advantages, such as year-round availability, high transportation capacity, environmental friendliness, low-carbon footprint, and a guarantee of smooth and safe operations. To better serve the 6th CIIE, the railway authorities have planned to operate three Jinbo China-Europe freight train trains, expecting to transport 210 TEUs of cargo worth over 350 million yuan (48 million). Since its inaugural run in 2021, Jinbohas facilitated European countries and other countriesalong the BRI route to participate in the CIIE, with the starting stations spanning from Duisburg and Hamburg in Germany to Malaszewicze in Poland. A noteworthy development for this year's first Jinbo is the implementation of electronic bills of lading for railway transport, enhancing the digitization of CIIE services and promoting the high-quality development of logistics and financial services in Shanghai. According to the railway authorities, the China-Europe Freight Train (Shanghai) has operated 72 trains this year, transporting 7,272 TEUs, with a total cargo weight of approximately 68,000 tons and a cargo value of about 2.38 billionyuan. It connects more than 60 cities and stations in nine countries in Eurasia, playing a positive role in advancing the BRI and consolidating Shanghai's position as a gateway for the initiative.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The first Jinbo China-Europe freight train carrying exhibits for the 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) arrived at the Minhang Station in Shanghai on Wednesday.

The jury convicted Aurora Police Officer Randy Roedema of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault. Former Aurora officer Jason Rosenblatt was acquitted. Roedema has been suspended without pay while Rosenblatt was fired in 2020 after responding ha ha to a picture texted to him by other officers, one of whom appeared to be administering a chokehold near a memorial for McClain. McClain, 23, had just purchased iced tea from a corner store in Aurora on the night of August 24, 2019, when he was stopped by police. Officers were responding to a report of a suspicious person wearing a ski mask and waving his arms. McClain regularly wore a mask because of a blood disorder that made him feel cold, his family has said. When officers told McClain to stop, the young man said he was an introvert and said please respect the boundaries that I am speaking, bodycam video of the confrontation showed. Officers questioned McClain before they tackled him, believing he was reaching for one of their guns, police said. There is been no evidence showing McClain, who was not armed, attempted take one of the guns. Officer Nathan Woodyard, set to go on trial this week, then put McClain in a chokehold that forced him into unconsciousness, prosecutors have said. He was fired after the incident. A pair of responding paramedics, also set for trial later this year, injected McClain with ketamine to sedate him after police video showed him writhing on the ground saying, I cannot breathe, please, and throwing up. He apologized for vomiting Minutes later, McClain was found to have no pulse in the ambulance and went into cardiac arrest, according to a report released in fall of 2019 by a local prosecutor, Dave Young. McClain was revived but later declared brain dead and then taken off life support. He died on August 30. The deadly confrontation sparked months of protests against police brutality in Colorado, preceding the national demonstrations that erupted in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Adams County prosecutors initially opted against charging the police and paramedics, but Colorado's attorney general intervened and secured indictments against those involved. An independent probe commissioned by the city of Aurora released in 2021 found that officers had no legal basis for detaining McClain and that paramedics on the scene sedated the 5-foo-6, 140-pound young man without conducting anything more than a brief visual observation.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Elijah McClain, 23, had just purchased iced tea from a corner store in Aurora on the night of August 24, 2019, when he was stopped by police.

The accident caused 10 million in damage to the vessel and 300,000 in damage to the dolphin. At about 0800 on July 28, 2022, the ferry Cathlamet was making a routine crossing of the Puget Sound with 94 people aboard. The master took over the helm from his quartermaster at 0810 in preparation for docking. As the ferry approached the Fauntleroy Terminal in West Seattle, it drifted off course. At 0814, four minutes after the master took the helm, it struck a dolphin adjacent to the pier at a speed of 16 knots. One person sustained a minor injury, and two passengers narrowly escaped from harm's way as the dolphin stove in the vessel's topsides. The ferry sustained extensive damage. The moment of contact, as captured by a security camera aboard Cathlamet (WSFNTSB) The vessel was still moving forward after the impact, and it risked hitting a cluster of anchored watercraft next to the terminal. The quartermaster instructed the master to back out three times, after which the master put both engines astern and halted the ferry's motion. According to NTSB, the master stopped making rudder commands about 30 seconds before impact and did not take any action to avert the accident or minimize damage, like backing down or sounding the general alarm. In interviews with investigators, he had no recollection of the moments leading up to the accident. The master's workrest history showed that he had been sleeping 5 to 6 hours a night in the days before the casualty, and he told the Coast Guard that he had had a hard time sleeping because of the heat (Seattle was experiencing a heat wave at the time). The quartermaster told investigators that the master was always tired in the morning. According to NTSB, the evidence was consistent with a microsleep, a brief period of sleep caused by fatigue. Fatigue affects all aspects of human performance, including decision-making, alertness, and reaction time, NTSB investigators concluded. Mariners should understand the performance effects of sleep loss and recognize the dangers of fatigue, such as microsleeps. The NTSB also found that Cathlamet's quartermaster was not monitoring the master as the ferry neared the dock, as is required by company policy. Instead, he was located towards the aft end of the wheelhouse and was focused on reading a company memo. If he had been watching closely, he could have taken over the helm when the master was asleep. NTSB marked this down to complacency, and noted that extra vigilance is required to prevent complacent attitudes for repetitive operations, such as ferry transits. The day after the casualty, the master retired from Washington State Ferries, surrendered his Merchant Mariners' Credential and ceased providing information for the investigation, according to NSTB.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Ferry Cathlamet was making a routine crossing of the Puget Sound with 94 people aboard.

A Florida man who was accused of locking his adopted 14-year-old son in a small structure in a garage was convicted on child abuse and other charges Thursday, according to court records. Tim Ferriter, now 48, and his wife Tracy were arrested last year on allegations that the boy had been locked in the 8-by-8-foot structure at various times, Jupiter police have said. The boy said the longest was 16 to 18 hours, according to court records. A jury convicted Ferriter on Thursday on charges of aggravated child abuse, false imprisonment and neglect of a child.

If convicted, the suspects could face life in prison. The illicit consignment arrived at Melbourne from Malaysia on October 4, and Australian Border Force officers noticed something unusual during x-ray screening of the cargo. They notified the Australian Federal Police (AFP), who inspected the shipment and launched an investigation. According to the AFP, the cargo contained 622 packages labeled as tea concealed within the pallets of toilet paper. Each package weighed one kilo, and on opening and inspection, they all contained a white crystalline substance identified as methamphetamine. Parceled out for commercial sale, this shipment could have supported 6.2 million individual one-gram street deals worth an estimated US350 million, the authorities claimed. The police quickly identified a team of foreign nationals who were allegedly behind the shipment. On Wednesday, a task force of officers from multiple agencies arrested four men: two 33-year-old Chinese nationals, a Malaysian national, 34, and a Hong Kong national, 32. Two of them were detained at Melbourne's airport as they were preparing to leave Australia. Additional raids at warehouses, storage facilities and homes in the Melbourne area turned up further evidence linked to the imports, police said.

We see it translate directly into a broad range of areas including road trauma, family violence, homicides, shootings and other violent offending.

Shepard, a gay college freshman at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, was abducted, robbed and beaten into a coma on October 6, 1998. The two men who attacked Shepard tied him to a fence in freezing weather. He was discovered 18 hours later by a bicyclist, who initially mistook him for a scarecrow. Shepard died in a Colorado hospital on October 12, 1998, surrounded by family. Matthew's tragic and senseless murder shook the conscience of the American people, Biden said in a statement. And his courageous parents, Judy and Dennis Shepard, turned Matthew's memory into a movement, galvanizing millions of people to combat the scourge of anti-LGBTQI hate and violence in America. The two assailants, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, were sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder, but they were not charged with hate crimes. At the time, attacks motivated by a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity did not qualify as hate crimes under Wyoming law. Wyoming is currently one of just two states, along with South Carolina, that does not have a law allowing additional penalties in hate-motivated crimes. In 2009, the Obama administration enacted the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The law extended federal hate crimes laws to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and disabilities and was named after Shepard and a Texas Black man who was murdered by white supremacists the same year of Shepard's killing. Biden, who was vice president at the time, lauded the 2009 law on Thursday and vowed to continue the fight against hate, against violence, and against bigotry in all its forms. Today, as threats and violence targeting the LGBTQI community continue to rise, our work is far from finished, he said. No American should face hate or violence for who they are or who they love. Anti-LGBTQ demonstrations have spiked over the past year, in addition to several high-profile acts of violence allegedly incited by anti-LGBTQ sentiments. In August, a teenager was arrested for stabbing a 28-year-old gay professional dancer, O'Shae Sibley, to death at a gas station in Brooklyn, New York, in what police later said was a hate crime. That same month, Laura Ann Carleto, a California business owner and mother of nine, was shot and killed over a Pride flag displayed in her clothing store. From June 2022 to May, there was an average of 39 anti-LGBTQ protests per month in the YOU.S. compared with just three a month from January 2017 through May 2022, according to a recent report by the Crowd Counting Consortium, a research group that tracks political protests. In his statement Thursday, Biden also again called for Congress to pass the Equality Act, legislation that would amend the 1969 Civil Rights Act to include anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The legislation passed in the then-Democratic-controlled House in 2021 -- with support of three Republicans -- but has since stalled in the Senate.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Shepard, a gay college freshman at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, was abducted, robbed and beaten into a coma on October 6, 1998.

Within hours of Hamas' brazen and bloody attack on Saturday, Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery at a disputed, Israeli-occupied area along Lebanon's southern border. This was met swiftly with a barrage of Israeli artillery, leading to tit-for-tat combat that has killed nine people. Were Hezbollah to choose to enter the conflict -- a decision that it appears to be considering -- it could offer a muscular challenge to Israel and further internationalize a conflict that has already thrown the Middle East into turmoil. Hezbollah, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the United States and many other countries, heaped further praise Wednesday on Hamas' bloody attacks on southern Israel. Condemning President Joe Biden's support for Israel, it said that it would not cower in the face of American naval assets, including the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, now parked in the eastern Mediterranean. Sending aircraft carriers to the region with the aim of raising the morale of the enemy and its frustrated soldiers reveals the weakness of the Zionist military machine, Hezbollah said in a statement. Our nation and the resistance factions are ready for confrontation until final victory and complete liberation are achieved. To date however, both Israel and Hezbollah appear to be showing restraint -- consistent with the informal rules of engagement that have governed the cross-border conflict for nearly two decades. People close to Hezbollah and experts on the region warn that this could change at any time and the group will make a calculation based on Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip and whether Iran -- which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah -- pushes the group into war. If that happens, Hezbollah has vast supplies of advanced weaponry, advanced training and well-organized ranks of experienced troops who have been bloodied by more than a decade of fighting Sunni Islamist militants in Syria, dwarfing the capability of Hamas. For now though, experts say the group may view its presence on Israel's northern border as a deterrent to a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip by Israel, or it may be holding itself in reserve. Hezbollah may, in part, be trying to confuse Israel, Marwa Osman, a lecturer at the Lebanese International University. The game changer would be the use of massive force or the arrival of YOU.S. forces and equipment to the Palestinian occupied territories, she said. Inside southern Lebanon, at a funeral for two Hezbollah fighters killed in the cross-border shelling on Tuesday, the rage among the crowd of thousands was palpable. Chants of Death to Israel and America, you are the greatest Satan rang out amid Shiite religious prayers and martial music. Ali Zalzali, a local imam, or religious cleric, close to the group and its adherents said a decision on whether to enter the fight was still in the offing. Insisting that the group would not be influenced by Iran, he said it does not wait for a signal from anyone. He added that it would be an independent and internal decision taken by Hezbollah and its revered and secretive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. We are a nation of jihad, and we have offered hundreds, thousands of martyrs and sacrifices, he said. And yet, entering the war would almost certainly cost Hezbollah dearly. Though the Shia Islamist group is primarily a militant organization with an archenemy in Israel, it also has a political party arm that competes in Lebanese parliamentary elections, maintains alliances with other political parties, holds ministerial posts and, on some level, answers to voters among Lebanon's highly sectarian society.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is a menacing presence on Israel's northern border.

Iran has had a long relationship with Hamas. Hamas would not be Hamas without the support over many, many years from Iran, he told NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt in an interview that will air Thursday evening. And so, we know that. We see that. When it comes to this specific attack, in this moment, we do not have direct evidence that Iran was involved in the attack, either in planning it or carrying it out. He noted, There is a much longer complicity between Iran and Hamas that the world knows and it is one of the reasons that since this administration has been in office, we have sanctioned Iran, individuals companies, more than 400 times including for support to to Hamas. Blinken arrived in Israel on Wednesday with the goal of offering support and solidarity to the longtime YOU.S. ally in the wake of the brutal terrorist attack on people in Israel by Hamas last Saturday. The Biden administration had faced scrutiny over its decision to unfreeze 6 billion in oil reserve funds as part of a prisoner exchange with Iran, which has historically funded Hamas. The White House had insisted that the money, which is held in a Qatari bank, could be used only for humanitarian purposes. Blinken also said Thursday in his interview with NBC News that none of the funds had been distributed yet. The YOU.S. and Qatari governments have now also agreed to block Iran from accessing any of the 6 billion, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House Democrats on Thursday, according to three sources familiar with his remarks, two of whom were in the room. Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and was also slated to meet with other Israeli officials including President Isaac Herzog and members of Israel's cabinet. Blinken said he would also be meeting with YOU.S. embassy personnel in Israel. John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Thursday that the number of American citizens killed during Saturday's terrorist attack had risen to 27, with 14 people also unaccounted for. Blinken announced in joint statements with Netanyahu that the YOU.S. is also working closely with Israel's government to determine the whereabouts of Americans who remain unaccounted for and if they have been taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza. This must be a moment of moral clarity. The failure to unambiguously condemn terrorism puts at risk not only people in Israel, but people everywhere, Blinken said during a joint statement with Netanyahu. Blinken explained that the current situation is personal to him as a Jew himself and because his grandfather fled pogroms in Russia and his stepfather survived three major concentration camps during the Holocaust. I understand, on a personal level, the harrowing echoes that the Hamas massacres carry for Israeli Jews, indeed, for Jews everywhere, he said. The message that I bring to Israel is this. You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side. That is the message that President Biden delivered to the prime minister from the moment this crisis began. Blinken reiterated that the YOU.S. has Israel's back and that it has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean, is supplying more ammunition interceptors to help replenish Israel's Iron Dome and is sending more YOU.S. military support. Blinken told reporters at a separate press conference on Thursday that he was shown graphic photographs, including of dead children and beheaded soldiers. It is hard to find the right words, he said. It is beyond what anyone would ever want to imagine, much less actually see and god forbid experience. A baby, an infant riddled with bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars or in their hideaway rooms. Earlier in the day, Blinken made a previously unscheduled stop at a donation center in Tel Aviv where he met with a survivor of the festival attack in southern Israel on Saturday. Blinken is scheduled to travel to Amman, Jordan on Friday to meet with both Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordanian King Abdullah II. He is also planning to travel to Qatar on Friday to meet with senior officials, a YOU.S. official confirmed on Thursday. His meetings in Doha will focus on joint Qatari-YOU.S. efforts to secure the release of the hostages and to de-escalate, according to a source with knowledge of the visit. At least 1,300 Israelis -- including 222 soldiers -- were killed during Hamas' attack on Saturday and more than 3,300 have been injured. In Gaza, at least 1,400 people have been killed and more than 6,000 injured.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"There is no direct evidence that Iran was involved in Hamas' brutal assault on Israel last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

A weak macroeconomic environment, geopolitical risks and a growing sense of uncertainty have dominated discussions this year. China's economic slowdown, fears of a higher-for-longer interest rates environment, weak global manufacturing and looming supply surpluses amid rising LME inventories remain the key risks ahead. China's real estate worries deepen China's official gauge of manufacturing activity only just returned to growth for the first time in six months, at 50.2, in September. However, all things related to the property market continue to struggle. Stimulus measures introduced over the last couple of months are yet to have a meaningful impact on metals demand. Additional measures might be necessary to boost demand for industrial metals. Renewed concerns over the fate of China Evergrande have surfaced following the detention of its chairman. And there are still questions looming over the economy's largest developer, Country Garden, after it warned that it might not be able to meet repayments on offshore debt. A slump in China's property market has been a major headwind to metals demand this year, with the LMEX Index of six metals down around 10 this year. During Golden Week in early October, which is typically a prime time for property developers, home sales declined from last year. A continued slowdown in China's property sector remains the main threat to metals demand looking ahead. We believe the short-term outlook remains bearish for metals demand and we do not foresee a substantial recovery before next year. Metals prices should continue to trade under pressure in the fourth quarter with the only upside risk being if Chinese demand recovers faster than anticipated. Prices are likely to remain volatile through the quarter as markets will continue to react to macro drivers. US consumer price inflation for September rose slightly faster than the consensus forecast, pushing the dollar and Treasury yields higher. Meanwhile, US payrolls surged in September, underscoring the strength seen in economic activity over the summer backing the Fed's argument on the need for interest rates to stay higher for longer. The market pricing around the possibility of a rate hike by December has increased marginally, but our US economist doubts it will happen. Fed officials have been emphasising the importance of the increase in Treasury yields as a factor that will tighten financial conditions and reduce the need for another rate hike. Our US economist believes that monetary policy is restrictive enough and does not think that the Fed will hike again. Elevated rates have been a drag on industrial metals consumption. Looking forward to 2023 and further into 2024, the possibility of US Fed continuing to raise rates and other major economies continuing with monetary tightening, remains the key uncertainty for metals markets. If US rates stay higher for longer, this would lead to a stronger US dollar and weaker investor sentiment, which in turn would translate to lower metals prices. Weak demand for industrial metals amid China's slow economic recovery and a slowdown in manufacturing globally is translating into rising inventories in LME-registered warehouses, the market of last resort. However, they remain low by historical standards. We believe low inventories fuel the possibility for spot prices to rise rapidly if consumption picks up sooner than expected. For copper, global LME stocks now stand at 179,675 tonnes as of 11 October, up more than 100 from 88,550 tonnes at the start of 2023, and the highest it has been since October 2021. LME copper stocks have been rising for the past few months and have more than tripled since July. For zinc, LME warehouse stocks have risen to 89,050 tonnes, up more than 190 from 30,475 tonnes in January. Zinc inventories reached their peak this year at the end of August at 153,975 tonnes. Aluminium stocks in LME warehouses have also been rising. They are currently at 492,650 tonnes, up 10 from 447,250 tonnes at the beginning of the year. And as LME inventories continue to rise, a lack of brand variety is adding to concerns for the aluminium market. About 76 of aluminium in the LME's warehouses was of Russian origin at the end of September, up from less than 10 before the start of the war in Ukraine. This is the highest level for at least a decade. However, the share of the Russian metal declined from 81 at the end of August. India is the other major source of LME aluminium stocks.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"LME Week, the metals industry's biggest annual gathering, is coming to an end.

So researchers began to probe the mystery: Were the massive mammals being hit by ships, tangled in fishing gear or stricken with disease? A new study, published Thursday in the journal Science, offers an answer: Changes to sea ice conditions in the Arctic appear to be causing gray whale populations to boom and bust based on shifting access to the tiny shrimplike creatures they eat. We have kind of cracked the case of these big die-offs, and we have found they happen more frequently than we expected, said Josh Stewart, an assistant professor at Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute and a lead author of the paper. Stewart's team found that the whales' population appears linked to the length of time that sea ice blocks their access to feeding grounds in the Arctic and to the quality of food available when the whales are there. It comes down to how much food do they have and how long do they have to eat, Stewart said. Climate change has played a role recently -- the extent of Arctic sea ice varies widely year to year, but rising temperatures are causing a long-term decline. Initially, that decline opened more days of access to feeding grounds for gray whales. But Arctic warming has also set off a slew of other changes -- to currents, water temperature and sea ice algae -- that have reduced the quality of the whales' food. They are not making as good a living, Stewart said. The new study offers evidence that sea ice variability was also behind two prior gray whale mass death events, including a well-documented die-off that began in the late 1990s. The findings suggest, as well, that climate change could limit the number of gray whales that can survive in the future, as diminishing sea ice impacts the population of tiny, seafloor-dwelling crustaceans the whales love to eat. Most North Pacific gray whales migrate more than 5,000 miles twice a year, spending their winters in warm lagoons off Mexico, where they can safely raise calves and reproduce, then feasting in the Arctic during the summer. In those Arctic feeding grounds, gray whales dive to the bottom of shallow basins, suck up sediment filled with crustaceans called amphipods, and then filter out the food from the mud. The enormous creatures -- which can reach nearly 50 feet in length, weigh about 90,000 pounds and have been documented living as long as 80 years -- spend only about four months feeding, Stewart said. The rest of the year, they mostly fast. They really have to gorge themselves for those four months, Stewart said. For the new study, Stewart's team analyzed data from long-term monitoring programs to evaluate whales' abundance, reproduction, deaths and body condition over the past 50 years. From those numbers, it was clear that gray whale populations have had periodic booms and busts. The scientists then compared that data to the animals' level of access to their feeding grounds and the abundance of crustaceans, finding a pattern. Researchers have long suspected that Arctic conditions could be impacting gray whales, and past studies have investigated whether the availability of prey could play a role in die-offs. The new findings show convincingly that there is a relationship between ice cover and variability in gray whale populations, said Elliott Hazen, a research ecologist at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center, who was not involved in the new study. We have a clearer idea of what happened, Hazen said. Once ravaged by 19th and 20th-century commercial whaling, North Pacific gray whales became a beacon of conservation success after the 1960s, as federal protections and international whaling restrictions led their population to boom. The species is protected by the YOU.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and the International Whaling Commission. Since the height of the whaling industry, when gray whale blubber was used for oil, the animals have made a remarkable recovery. Gray whales have been one of our quickest rebounding populations, Hazan said. But in 1999, hundreds of whales began washing up dead on beaches in the YOU.S., Mexico and Canada. Scientists knew many more were dying away from human view. For every whale that washes up dead, there are 20 that die that do not wash up, Stewart said. When the same pattern played out again two decades later, scientists began to dive deeper. The new study puts the recent rash of deaths into context and highlights the threats the species faces going forward. The North Pacific gray whale population had surged to about 27,000 by 2016, according to NOAA estimates; today, that number is closer to 14,500. Stewart said he is not worried that gray whales will go extinct. The mammals have persisted through ice ages, periods of warming and tens of thousands of years of changes to their prey -- not to mention a period of extensive human hunting. They have lived through major climatic change in the past. They are quite adaptable, Stewart said. But Arctic warning is now a major problem for the whales, one that Stewart said could ultimately limit the number of mammals sustained by the feeding grounds. That is a tough thing to swallow, Stewart said. We have locked in changes that may have altered how many whales they can fundamentally support.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,More than 680 gray whales have washed up or been found dead on North America's Pacific shores over the last four years.

The Department of Justice's decision, first reported by The Intercept, came after a criminal investigation found agents' use of force under the facts and circumstances presented in this case does not rise to the level of a federal criminal civil rights violation or a criminal violation assimilated under Arizona law, Zachry Stoebe, public affairs officer with the YOU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona, said in a statement. Body-cam footage released by YOU.S. Customs and Border Protection in June appeared to show Mattia, who was unarmed, reaching into his jacket and removing his hand quickly, immediately before agents fired on him.

But an attorney for Mattia's family said the officials present shared no substantial information from their investigation and would not answer basic questions from the family. The family is looking for answers and justice, Ryan Stitt, the San Diego-based attorney representing the family, told the Arizona Daily Star on Thursday. The family will likely file a civil lawsuit to get answers about what happened that night, he said. In particular, the family wants to know the agency affiliation of all officers who opened fire on Mattia, as officers from both Border Patrol and the Tohono O'odham tribal police department were on site. Customs and Border Protection said in a June press release that three Border Patrol agents fired on Mattia, out of 10 agents who were present, and that there was one tribal policeman on duty in the area that night. During the September meeting, Mattia's family asked DOJ employees if tribal police also fired at Mattia. In response, they said it was not the appropriate time to do civil discovery, a legal term related to information you would get as part of a civil lawsuit, Stitt said. That response suggested to the family that DOJ officials were looking to protect themselves against this forthcoming lawsuit, instead of answering the family's questions about who the shooters were, what they said and what the independent investigation shows, and why charges are not going to be filed, Stitt said. The family has a clear right to that information. On Thursday the Star asked Stoebe, of the YOU.S. Attorney's Office's Arizona district, whether any tribal police members also fired on Mattia. Stoebe said a Freedom of Information Act request is necessary to get that information, which the Star filed on October 12. The lack of transparency from the YOU.S. Attorney's Office is really disappointing and upsetting to the family, Stitt said. It compounds their grief and the injury that they have suffered. Night of the shooting Mattia, 58, lived near the YOU.S.-Mexico border in a remote Tohono O'odham village called Menagers Dam, about 140 miles southwest of Tucson. Mattia's family said on May 18, the night he was killed, Mattia had called law enforcement to report border-crossers on his property. Raymond called for help and, in turn, was shot down at his doorstep, the family said in a statement at the time. In our eyes and hearts, we believe that Raymond was approached with excessive and deadly force that took his life. CBP said Ajo Border Patrol Station agents responded to a request for assistance from the Tohono O'odham Nation Police Department around 9 p.m., after receiving a report of gunfire in the area. Agents met a tribal police officer at a local recreation center and followed the officer by car, then on foot, to an area near Mattia's home. The body-cam footage CBP released in June shows Mattia illuminated by agents' search lights in front of his home. A few moments later, the video shows Mattia throwing an object toward the officers, which lands at their feet, after agents ordered him to put down what he was carrying. Agents later learned that it was a machete still in its sheath. Mattia, who was unarmed at that point, then appears to reach into his jacket and agents yell, Put your hands out of your (expletive) pocket! As Mattia quickly pulls out his hand, a volley of gunfire immediately follows and Mattia falls face down on the ground. According to the autopsy report, agents' bullets struck Mattia's torso five times and his extremities another five times. Afterwards agents approach and begin life-saving efforts, including CPR, the video shows. He was pronounced dead at 10:06 p.m. The autopsy report showed Mattia had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system. According to the toxicology report from the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office, Mattia had a high enough level of methamphetamine to cause intoxication, and a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit for driving. Mattia's family and supporters have decried the shooting, saying it shows how a militarized border region has damaged the tribe, whose ancestral lands encompass terrain on both sides of the border with Mexico. Mattia was a father, uncle, brother, friend, and an involved community member, the family's May statement said. Raymond always fought for what was right, and he will continue to fight even after his death. This is not an isolated incident, but it should bring awareness of the oppression our people live through. Contact reporter Emily Bregel at ebregeltucson.com.

Bess called in sick on the day that a horrific fire tore through the garment factory. Celia died, along with 144 others. The tragedy transformed YOU.S. labor law and the building that housed the factory, now a New York University science building, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003. But until this week, there had never been a permanent memorial paying tribute to the fire's victims. One was unveiled Wednesday at the site of the factory on the corner of Washington Place and Green Street near Washington Square Park. The memorial was conceived by the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition, a nonprofit group of descendants and labor advocates dedicated to preserving the memory of the mostly Jewish and Italian immigrant women who died that day and the fire's impact on the organized labor movement.

This triggers emotions for a lot of people and opens our eyes to something that so many did not know anything about. According to the story that is been passed down through in the Kestenbaum family, Bess called in sick on March 25, 1911, a warm Saturday. Her sister, Celia, just 17, went to work without her. Near the end of the workday, a cigarette butt ignited fabric scraps inside the factory, on the ninth floor of the Asch Building. As the flames began to spread, the women who worked there found that they had been locked in from the outside by management, who wanted to prevent the workers, who made roughly 7 a week, from stealing inventory as well as keep out union organizers. The fire was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in New York City history. The memorial, in the making for more than a decade, includes a massive stainless steel ribbon that floats horizontally along the edge of the building -- the names and ages of the victims are cut out of the ribbon. A stone panel underneath the ribbon reflects the names back to the viewers and also bears quotes from witness and survivor testimonies. On Wednesday, the reflective stone panel was also adorned with 146 white roses in honor of the victims. Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke at the unveiling ceremony of a memorial for the 146 victimes of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, October 12, 2023. (Office of Governor Kathy Hochul) It is getting some really beautiful reactions, Uri Wegman, who, along with Richard Joon Yoo, was one of the two architects of the memorial, told the New York Jewish Week. You never know how people are going to respond and I feel like we are accomplishing exactly what we designed the memorial to do, to transport and reorient people to the events of the tragedy, the Israeli-born architect said. Over the next few months, a vertical steel column will be installed to showcase the height from which workers jumped in a futile attempt to escape the flames. The Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organizes an annual event on the anniversary of the fire, in partnership with Workers United, the New York City Central Labor Council, the FDNY and New York University. I have waited a really long time to say three words to you -- three powerful words, and three extraordinarily sweet words: We did it, said Mary Anne Trasciatti, the president of the coalition, at Wednesday's unveiling ceremony. By honoring the Triangle workers with this memorial, we are making a statement about the dignity and humanity of every worker, past and present. We are showing our support for baristas, auto workers, nurses, teachers, farm workers, warehouse workers, coal miners.

Donate Unions from around the city and beyond -- including the International Ladies Garment Workers, the Steamfitters Union, the Laborer's International Union, Actor's Equity, United Automobile Workers and the SAG-AFTRA Union -- sent representatives to the unveiling ceremony. At the ceremony, labor organizers reminded the crowd about how the fire jumpstarted labor reforms and workers' rights efforts, including activism and legislation that led to safety protocols, workers' compensation, a 40-hour work week, minimum wage and pensions. They also used the opportunity to speak about workers' rights today, pledging continuing support for the Hollywood actors' and United Auto Workers strikes. Hundreds of people, including descendants of victims, union members, local officials and labor activists came to the unveiling of the memorial, October 11, 2023. (Julia Gergely) The Triangle fire -- with its large number of Jewish, Eastern European immigrant victims -- also galvanized the Jewish community, which had an already active labor base, Ann Toback, the chief executive officer of the Worker's Circle, told the New York Jewish Week. Founded in 1900 as a fraternal organization to help Eastern European immigrants adjust to American society and workplaces, the Workers Circle was a central base for Jewish labor activists and in 1909 helped organize a general strike in the shirtwaist industry that lasted 11 weeks and which consisted of 20,000 young Jewish women. One of the only holdouts of the strike was the Triangle company. After the tragedy in 1911, Jewish union organizers Clara Lemlich and Rose Schneiderman marched from the site of the tragedy to Cooper Square to demand new changes and more organizing. It did spark a new outcry of activism and The Workers Circle at that time was very much a center of labor activism, Toback said. Jewish labor activists and Workers Circle members were also at the forefront of expanding the membership and organizing power of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, which became one of the country's largest labor unions after the fire. The Workers Circle also helped sponsor the memorial. In remarks, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul shared that her grandfather, uncles and father worked in coke ovens at the Bethlehem Steel plant, itself the site of multiple fatal industrial accidents. I am so proud to be part of this effort to honor the names of those who were lost in that horrific inferno, Hochul said. She called New York the birthplace of the workers' rights movement because of what happened right on this block. New York State allocated 1.5 million in state funds to build the memorial. A steel ribbon with cutouts of the names of the victims wraps around the former site of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Street. (Julia Gergely) Hochul, who has been trying to maintain support for immigrants as the city struggles with the recent influx of nearly 125,000 migrants, connected the fire to the present day. Our workers deserve to be protected and we will fight to make sure they have those rights, Hochul said. This state is so great because of the immigrants, the migrants who came here. Let them work. We need them. Julie Su, the Acting YOU.S. Secretary of Labor, also addressed the crowd. We can imagine the black plume of smoke up in the air, the flames that spread from floor to floor, the panic of the workers who ran and found closed exits and broken fire escapes, she said. Their cries for help and then the thud of bodies as they began to jump one after another. Allison Kestenbaum said she has always felt a strong connection to her relative and other victims of the fire. I went to NYU. If I had been there two generations earlier, an immigrant, I would not have had the opportunity to go to college -- I would have been a seamstress in a sweatshop, she said.

The YOU.S., other G7 countries and Australia imposed the cap last year, seeking to reduce Russia's revenues from seaborne oil exports as part of sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine. The cap bans Western companies from providing maritime services, including insurance, finance and shipping, for Russian seaborne oil exports sold above 60 a barrel, while seeking to keep oil flowing to markets. Caps also were imposed on Russian fuel exports. YOU.S. President Joe Biden's administration placed sanctions on Turkey-based Ice Pearl Navigation SA, owner of the Yasa Golden Bosphorus, which the Treasury said carried Russian ESPO crude priced above 80 a barrel after the cap took effect in December last year. The YOU.S. also imposed sanctions on UAE-based Lumber Marine SA, owner of the SCF Primorye, which the Treasury said was carrying Novy Port Russian crude above 75 per barrel. Both tankers, which conducted port calls in Russia, used YOU.S.-based service providers while transporting the Russian origin oil, the Treasury said. Because of the actions we are announcing today, and the further actions we will take in the coming weeks and months, these costs will continue to rise and Russia's ability to sustain its barbaric war will continue to weaken, a senior Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters in a call. Turkey's Yasa Holding, operator of the Golden Bosphorus, said the vessel is currently under time-charter for 3-5 months with Exxon Mobil XOM.N. The YOU.S. oil major was not immediately available for comment. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any involvement by Exxon. Yasa added the company had necessary documentation from major London insurers for it to carry Russian origin cargoes and that it has been company policy for more than a year to not carry Russian crude. Global oil prices have risen to around 85 a barrel in recent months on production cuts and thin world spare production capacity. That has helped to limit the efficacy of the cap, but actions to toughen enforcement will make it more effective, according to people who advised the Treasury. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday that preliminary estimates showed Russian crude oil exports last month stood at 4.9 million bpd, down about 100,000 barrels per day from the May-June average. But it also said Russia's total exports of crude oil and products in September rose by 460,000 bpd to 7.6 million bpd, with crude accounting for 250,000 bpd of the increase. The cap has forced Russia and traders who want to participate in the Russian oil trade to invest in what the industry refers to as a ghost fleet of old tankers vulnerable to leaks and oil spills. Those vessels are undertaking long voyages to deliver crude to refiners in China and India, which have become the largest buyers of Russian crude. Neither country has imposed sanctions on trade with Russia. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said on the Telegram messaging app that the new sanctions were the result of an international working group he helped create and that violations of the Russian oil price cap will be punished. The YOU.S. Treasury official said the cap forces Russia to pay about 36 a barrel for those non-Western maritime services, expenses that go to tankers not tanks reducing its revenues for use in the Ukraine war. YOU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday said the price cap had sharply reduced Russian revenues over the past 10 months, and that it was critical to keep imposing severe and increasing costs on Russia over its war in Ukraine. Just before the YOU.S. sanctions were announced, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters at IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Marrakech, Morocco, that the cap has been efficient in reducing Russia's revenues but that there are loopholes.

The United Auto Workers strike finally began to take its toll on the Automotive MMI (Monthly Metals Index) as well as month-over-month steel prices. Regarding price drops, hot-dipped galvanized managed to suffer the most. And with the strike continuing to escalate, negotiations stagnating, and more and more layoffs occurring nationwide, the index faces massive bearish pressure in the immediate future. Overall, the Automotive MMI dropped by 4.51 Jeep manufacturer Stellantis announced that it has laid off more than 500 employees at the Trenton Engine Complex, as well as a smaller number of workers in Indiana. The UAW strike, which led to storage difficulties and a lack of parts, proved the primary reason for the layoff decision. At the moment, 640 Stellantis employees are currently on temporary release due to the strike. Other automakers have also witnessed impacts from the UAW's ongoing protest. Due to the strike at the Chicago Assembly Plant, Ford requested that 71 employees of the Livonia Transmission Plant not report to work on Monday, October 9. Like Stellantis, Ford also experienced a scarcity of parts due to the strike. Ultimately, General Motors (GM) had to idle an assembly plant in Kansas, resulting in the layoff of around 2,000 workers. Economic analysts estimate that the UAW strike has thus far cost the automotive sector 5.5 billion. Indeed, nearly 13,000 GM, Ford, and Stellantis employees took to picket lines over the past four weeks. The UAW has since criticized the Big Three automakers' decisions to fire workers, with union leader Shawn Fain claiming that the Big Three are using the layoffs as a strategy to put the squeeze on our members to settle for less. Ultimately, the strike continues to lower demand for auto steel, adding bearish pressure to already falling steel prices. Indeed, auto companies produced 6,030 fewer vehicles per day due to the UAW strike's effects. The cost of the UAW strike reflects the 16 days that production was halted at one assembly facility in Wentzville, Missouri, which produces mid-size pickups. Because of the strike, Ford has had to let go of around 930 employees. Meanwhile, Stellantis released at least 370 employees in Ohio and Indiana. That said, it is possible that the strike may eventually reduce steel availability and raise steel prices, though only time will tell. After overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year deal, thousands of unionized workers at Mack Trucks went on strike. According to the United Auto Workers (UAW), 73 of its members voted against the proposed agreement. The deal apparently included a 19 pay increase, a 3,500 ratification bonus, improved retirement benefits, additional vacation time for some employees, and a shorter time to reach top pay. About 4,000 Mack employees represent the UAW in three separate states. According to UAW President Shawn Fain, several issues still need to be resolved, including clauses relating to salary, work schedules, benefits, and health and safety. The latest strike is distinct from the UAW disagreement with Detroit's Big Three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, as Mack Trucks belongs to Volvo. Since September 15, the UAW has been striking specifically against the Detroit Three automakers' facilities, with around 25,000 of the 146,000 UAW workers participating. Ford agreed to enhance its salary increase to 23 over four years, potentially raising expectations for union members at Mack due to recent developments in their own negotiations. The Mack arrangement also included an immediate 10 pay hike and nine more percentage points of compensation increases over the course of the five-year contract. When the UAW decided to strike, Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said that the firm was surprised and disappointed, and that the action proved needless.

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. Dating can consist of great communication, spotty here-and-there texts or even ghosting -- in which people ignore each other to end a relationship. Now comes a study about female frogs -- and revelations about how the amphibians take ghosting to the next level in their world by playing dead to avoid unwanted male interactions. A recent study published in The Royal Society Open Science journal focused on male and female European common frogs to see whether the females avoided the males in different situations. GHOST RAINBOWS, 'RAINING FROGS' AND SUN HALOS: WEIRD WEATHER PHENOMENA SEEN ACROSS THE US The researchers tested various avoidance behaviors by the female frogs -- including rotating, release calls and tonic immobility, according to The Royal Society. Rotating was defined as a female starting to rotate around her own body axis when amplexed by a male. Amplexus is defined as the mating embrace of some amphibians, according to Merriam-Webster. AMERICA'S ODDEST LAWS INCLUDE RULES AGAINST DRESSING AS NUNS, EATING FROGS AND MORE Release calls were defined as when the female is amplexed by the male, and she begins to call -- making a certain noise. Tonic immobility is the stiffening of a female: The frog will stretch out her arms and legs and act as if she is dead. The researchers found that rotating was the most common method of avoidance by the 54 females studied -- with 83 of them using that avoidance method, according to the study. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Release calls were done by 48 of the females -- and were always associated with rotating as well. The study also found that tonic immobility, or playing dead, occurred among 33 of the female frogs in combination with both rotating and calling. It was also determined that a smaller female frog size was associated with all three tactics, as the study reported. Researchers began the study in 2019 when they collected the frogs.

Ron DeSantis on Wednesday night took aim at former President Donald Trump after he described Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group that has been exchanging fire across the border with Israel since Hamas launched its surprise attack on the country last weekend, as very smart. In remarks at a Club 47 event in West Palm Beach on Wednesday night, Trump blamed President Joe Biden for the deadly ongoing Israel-Hamas war by baselessly claiming that the Biden administration funded the attacks with the 6 billion in oil revenue it recently unfroze as a result of a prisoner exchange with Iran, which has historically funded Hamas. And then two nights ago, I read all of Biden security people -- can you imagine National Defense people and they said 'gee, I hope Hezbollah does not attack from the north because that is the most vulnerable spot,' Trump said. I said, 'Wait a minute,' You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They are all very smart. Trump also went after DeSantis in his speech, saying that the Florida governor has been flying around the country setting fire to his reputation and destroying the reputation frankly of Florida. DeSantis swiftly knocked Trump in a post to X that included a video of the former president's remarks: Terrorists have murdered at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans and are holding more hostage, so it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as 'very smart. As President, I will stand with Israel and treat terrorists like the scum that they are, he added. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DeSantis has sharpened his critiques against Trump in recent days, arguing that Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House in 2024 if Trump wins the GOP presidential nomination during an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday. I think a referendum on Joe Biden means we win, if I am the candidate. I think a referendum on Donald Trump, if that is it, then I think the Democrats would win, DeSantis said on Morning Joe. He said although there are millions of voters who disapprove of Biden, believe the country is heading in the wrong direction and want to vote for a Republican, Trump is just a dealbreaker for them. They just will not do it. Since Hamas launched its attacks against Israel last weekend, Republican 2024 presidential candidates have blamed the Biden administration for the attacks that have prompted an ongoing war. Several of the contenders have insisted, without evidence, that the YOU.S. funded the attacks as a result of the prisoner exchange deal with Iran. Biden has repeatedly stressed his administration's support for Israel amid its war with Hamas and efforts to free American hostages this week. His administration has also pushed back against the GOP criticism, insisting that the 6 billion in oil revenue that Iran recently regained access to did not come from YOU.S. taxpayer dollars. All of the money held in restricted accounts in Doha as part of the arrangement to secure the release of 5 Americans in September remains in Doha. Not a penny has been spent, Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson tweeted, referring to the Qatari banks holding the funds. These restricted funds cannot go to Iran -- it can only be used for future humanitarian-related purposes. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and misleading. Israel has launched airstrikes into the Gaza Strip and Hamas has fired rockets toward Tel Aviv as the war stretches into its sixth day. Israel's military said it is preparing for a possible ground operation in Gaza, a densely populated strip that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, half of whom are children.

Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on, and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home, he tweeted. After Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people in their homes, on the streets and at an outdoor music festival, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to crush the group, which has governed Gaza since 2007. The Israeli government is under intense public pressure to topple the militant group rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza after four previous conflicts ended with Hamas still firmly in charge of the territory. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities. The YOU.S. has also pledged unwavering support, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday to meet with Israeli leaders. He plans to meet Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority is confined to the occupied West Bank, and Jordan's King Abdullah II. You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourselves, but as long as America exists you will never have to, Blinken said after meeting with Netanyahu. We will always be there by your side.

Give the devil his due, the saying goes. When it comes to weapons innovation, no other evil entity - with the possible exception of the Soviet Union aka The Evil Empire - embodied this saying quite like Nazi Germany. In aerial warfare, the Third Reich's weaponry geniuses came up with the Wunderwaffen (Wonder Weapons) such world's first jet fighter, jet bomber, and rocket-powered fighter, that being the Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe, Arado Ar 234 Blitz, and Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet respectively, not to mention the first cruise missile long-range guided ballistic missile in the respective forms of the V-1 and V-2 rockets. Meanwhile, at the level of the ground fighters, Nazi Germany's war machine produced some historically significant guns for good measure. For one thing, there was the first assault rifle, the Sturmgewehr Stg-44. And then there was the subject of this article, the world's first general purpose machine gun (GPMG), the MG 34 7.92x57mm Mauser machine gun. In layman's terms, a GPMG is an air-cooled, fully automatic weapon that can be adapted to light machine gun (LMG) and medium machine gun (MMG) roles. It will typically feature a quick-change barrel, configuration for mounting on bipods, tripods, and vehicles as infantry support weapons, and chambered to fire full-powered rifle cartridges; for example, the MG 34's 7.92x57mm round is the same one used by the famed K98k Mauser infantry rifle (though it is ofttimes referred to as an 8mm for brevity). The German equivalent term for GPMG is Einheitsmaschinengewehr (Universal Machine Gun). Masterminded by small arms designer Heinrich Volmer (1885-1961), the MG (Maschinengewehr) 34 was initially designed in 1934 - hence the digital portion of the alphanumeric designation - and officially adopted into operational service with the Wehrmacht in 1936. The gun was recoil-operated and fired from an open rotating bolt. Specifications included an empty weight of 26.7 pounds, a weight of 70 pounds while mounted on a tripod, a barrel length of 24.7 inches, and an overall length of 48 inches. As far as the rate of fire is concerned, Jim Davis of GunMag Warehouse notes that the early models were capable of firing either 600 or 1,000 rounds per minute. Later, the rate of fire was fixed at the rate of 800-900 rounds per minute. Other models, which were typically used on aircraft, had higher rates of fire, some 1,200 or even 1,500 rounds per minute. Like many other Nazi weapons, such as the Tiger tank, it was way overengineered, with Will Dabbs, MD of The Armory Life describing it as a nightmare to build. Like the Tiger tank, the MG 34 had its fair share of battlefield reliability problems. Despite this, however, the MG 34 soldiered through the entirety of the Second World War, and it is safe to say that this GPMG actually ended accounting for way more Allied casualties than the main gun of the oh-so-ballyhooed Tiger. To quote Dr. Dabbs again, With the man-portable MG 34, however, a single mobile machine gun team could transport serious supporting automatic fire anyplace a man could walk. Warfare would never be the same. Indeed, speaking of WWII German tanks, they stuck with the MG 34 even after the much more reliable, user-friendly, and cost-efficient MG 42 came along. Why? Miguel Ortiz of We Are The Mighty - himself a former YOU.S. Army commissioned officer - answers that question in his February 2023 article: In short, science ... In the case of the MG 34 firing 1000 rounds per minute, the barrel would heat up fairly quickly under sustained fire ... machine guns like the MG 34 usually feature a barrel that can be swapped out quickly ... In the case of the MG 34, the barrel is replaced by rotating the receiver counter-clockwise from the barrel shroud ... On the MG 42, the barrel pops out to the right of the gun ... However, this was simply not compatible with the existing German tank designs ... Inside a tank, a gunner can easily rotate the MG 34's receiver and swap out the barrel if it gets too hot. But, because the rest of the gun is mounted in the hull or turret, the side-swapping barrel of the MG 42 would not work. The mounting designs would have to be completely reworked in order to accommodate it. Unsurprisingly, the war movies and action-adventure flicks in which the MP-40 has appeared are many in number. Just a few examples that come to mind are Raiders of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, and Escape From Sobibor. Believe it or not, International Military Antiques (I AM ABOUT TO) actually has one for sale! Granted, it is a mere display piece, but still a big-time collectible nonetheless. It is officially listed as Original German WWII MG 34 Display Machine Gun by Mauser Werke with Drum Carrier  Inert Ammo in Belt and sells for a measly 4,495.00. Oh wait, you say you actually to fire an MG 34? Well, you are still in luck, assuming you have the time and travel funds. Battlefield Vegas (in Las Vegas, Nevada, of course; where else?) has one available for rental; it will cost you 80.00 to fire off a 20-round ammo belt and 150.00 for 40 rounds, the latter being the literal and figurative more bang for your buck ... or would that be more rat-a-tat-tat for your buck in this case? So then, what if you are not interested in either owning or firing an MG 34 and are perfectly content to see the world's first GPMG in a museum? To cite just three examples, there is Britain's fantastic Imperial War Museum (IWM), as well as Greece's War Museum in Athens, and The Great White North's Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) Museum in London, Ontario.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The MG (Maschinengewehr) 34 was initially designed in 1934 - hence the digital portion of the alphanumeric designation.

That was revealed by the company Wednesday in a securities filing. That figure, which Microsoft disputes, stems from a long-running IRS probe into how Microsoft allocated its profits among countries and jurisdictions in the years 2004 to 2013. Critics of that practice, known as transfer pricing, argue that companies use it to minimize their tax burden by reporting lower profits in high-tax countries and higher profits in lower-tax jurisdictions. Microsoft said it will appeal the decision within the IRS, a process expected to take several years. The company's shares dropped slightly in aftermarket trading, falling 1.42 to 331.

LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- An independent panel has downgraded five Level I violations lodged by the NCAA against Kansas and basketball coach Bill Self. That effectively ends a long saga that began with a 2017 FBI investigation into college basketball corruption. Kansas will be required to remove its 2018 Final Four banner and vacate wins from the 2017-18 season in which Silvio De Sousa, a player central to the case, participated. The case against the Jayhawks hinged on whether representatives of the apparel company Adidas were considered boosters when two of them arranged payments to prospective recruits. Self served a school-imposed four-game suspension last season.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The speaker of the House is normally elected every two years, in January, when the House organizes for a new session. A new election can be held if the speaker dies, resigns or is removed from office. What is going on now in Washington is the first time an election is being held after the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker. Republicans on Wednesday nominated Majority Leader Steve Scalise as their nominee for speaker. Now the race is on to secure the 217 votes he will need on the House floor to win the gavel. But nearly half the GOP conference in the closed-door vote supported Rep. Jim Jordan, the Judiciary Committee chairman who was backed by Donald Trump. WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve officials regarded the YOU.S. economy's outlook as particularly uncertain last month, according to minutes released Wednesday, and said they would proceed carefully in deciding whether to further raise their benchmark interest rate. Such cautious views are generally seen as evidence that the Fed is not necessarily inclined to raise rates in the near future. Economic data from the past several months generally suggested that inflation was slowing, the minutes of the Sept. 19-20 meeting said. The policymakers added that further evidence of declining inflation was needed to be sure it would slow to the Fed's 2 target.

On the streets of Kfar Azza, the bodies of militants lie scattered between the shells of burned-out cars. Walls and doors of what used to be neatly kept stucco homes are blasted wide open. As bags holding the bodies of slain residents await identification, the smell of death hangs thick in the hot afternoon air.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Apartment Association says President Joe Biden's proposed rule to ban hidden and bogus junk fees could end up increasing the cost of rental housing. The association's CEO says policymakers should understand that layering additional regulations will harm the affordability and availability of rental housing, hurting the people they seek to protect. Biden says the Federal Trade Commission's junk fee ban proposed Wednesday will help families and honest businesses by unmasking the total cost of concert tickets, hotel rooms and utility bills. The Democratic president has made the removal of junk fees a priority. Biden administration officials says the additional costs can mislead people and waste their time. NEW YORK (AP) -- Movie theaters are readying for an onslaught like they have never seen before beginning Friday when Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour debuts. The concert film compiled from several Swift shows at Southern California's SoFi Stadium is expected to launch with 100 million, or possibly much more. The Eras Tour heralds something new and potentially game-changing in the movie industry. Swift and Beyonc are two of the biggest stars on the planet and are both heading into cinemas, the latter in December.

General manager Tom Fitzgerald announced the signing on Wednesday, a day before the Devils opened the 2023-24 season at home against the Detroit Red Wings. Devils managing partner David Blitzer said the extension was well deserved. The young Devils won 52 games and posted 112 points last season, both franchise records.

The NHL sent a memo to teams last week clarifying what players can and cannot do as part of theme celebrations this season, including a ban on the use of rainbow-colored stick tape for Pride nights. The updated guidance reaffirms on-ice player uniforms and gear for games, warmups and official team practices cannot be altered to reflect theme nights, including Pride, Hockey Fights Cancer or military appreciation. Players can voluntarily participate in themed celebrations off the ice. Previously the NHL had decided not to allow teams to wear any theme jerseys for warmups after a handful of players opted out last season.

AFP UN member states must hold the Myanmar military junta accountable for Monday's massacre of dozens of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kachin State, a group of former UN experts on Myanmar demanded on Thursday. At least 29 people including 13 children were killed at the displacement camp in Mung Lai Hkyet Village in Kachin's Waingmaw Township on Monday night. The site is about 3 km north of Laiza, where the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has its headquarters. The ethnic armed group is fighting the junta. The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M) said the latest junta attack on a displacement camp could constitute a war crime. Some 100 families displaced by junta violence were taking refuge at the camp at the time of the attack. The abhorrent junta attack in Mung Lai Hyket is a result of the utter failure of the international community to act for the protection of the Myanmar people, said the SAC-M's Chris Sidoti, a former member of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFMM). Monday's attack is the deadliest junta attack on civilians in Kachin State so far this year and comes almost a year after a junta air strike on a music concert killed around 75 people in the village of A Nang Pa in the state on October 23, 2022. The junta has denied involvement and blamed an explosion at an ammonium nitrate store in a KIA training camp near the village. KIA spokesman Colonel Naw Bu told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday that the regime's account of the explosion was propaganda, saying the armed group would never position a gunpowder warehouse near civilians. Yanghee Lee of SAC-M, former UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said the Myanmar military had become so emboldened by the indifference of the international community to its decades of atrocities that it is now attacking IDP camps. The military is flagrantly massacring the most vulnerable people in society, and yet UN entities in Myanmar will not even publicly name the military as the perpetrator. At what point will the UN decide to stand with the Myanmar people? she asked. The SAC-M said the junta had escalated its campaign of brutal violence against civilians across the country this year in wilful defiance of UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2669 adopted in December 2022, which demands an immediate end to all forms of violence throughout the country. UNSC demands within resolutions are considered legally binding under international law but the resolution lacks measures that would enable the council to enforce it, the SAC-M said. Attacking a camp for displaced people is an act so utterly depraved that it defies humanity. Such depraved acts of violence are the reason the Myanmar people have been forced into a nation-defining struggle to liberate themselves entirely from the Myanmar military's influence, said the SAC-M's Marzuki Darusman, former chair of the IIFFMM. The SAC-M urged the UNSC to enforce the junta's compliance with its resolution through the imposition of a global arms embargo and targeted financial sanctions, and the referral of the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. If the Security Council will not, or cannot, act, UN member states must take action through the General Assembly and pass an urgent resolution during the current 78th session, it stated.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,At least 29 people including 13 children were killed at the displacement camp in Kachin's Waingmaw Township on Monday night.

Shun Chi-ming, who previously worked for the Observatory, on Thursday said the suspension of rail services along open-air sections when the signal was raised on Sunday had damaged the citys image as a world-class tourist destination. The key issue lies not in whether the Observatory issued a typhoon signal No 9 on Sunday, but rather in why the MTR Corporation did not consider the actual weather conditions when deciding to suspend its services, he wrote on social media. Thousands struggled to find alternative travel when the citys sole rail operator suspended overland trains, including those for the Airport Express, only minutes after the forecaster issued the warning.Hong Kong coach boss driven to help as MTR passengers stranded in typhoon alert Shun said the practice dated back to July 23, 2012, when Typhoon Vicente hit Hong Kong and caused falling trees to damage overhead cables near Tai Po on the East Rail line. The incident left hundreds of people stranded on trains and stations overnight. It is important to note the situation that night was significantly different from what happened on Sunday. When No 9 alert was issued on July 23, 2012, Hong Kong was already experiencing widespread strong winds and gales, he explained. In contrast, the overall wind intensity on Sunday was much lower than when Typhoon Vicente hit due to the tight circulation of Typhoon Koinu, in which the strong winds only affected the offshore waters of southern Hong Kong. He also pointed to the MTR Corps decision to use anemometers, which measure wind speed and direction, for the Ngong Ping 360 cable car to help gauge when to suspend services. Similarly, Tsing Ma Bridge and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge have wind speed sensors installed to decide whether to cease operations due to high wind speeds, he said. So, why cannot the same be done for railway sections? Would it be appropriate to suspend operations for major bridges and roads in Hong Kong based solely on No 9 alert? The MTR Corp earlier said its trains generally withstood wind intensities equivalent of up to a No 8 typhoon signal, it did not mean they were incapable of withstanding conditions under a No 9 warning, since not all locations experienced the same intensity. The company also stressed the immediate suspension of services for all open-air sections of line during a No 9 signal was standard protocol that prioritised safety. It explained that fallen trees or debris blown onto the tracks could potentially impact the operation of overhead cables and trains.Hong Kong commuters brave heavy rain as Typhoon Koinu departs city Clarence Fong Chi-kong, founder of Weather Underground of Hong Kong, said decisions on whether to run transport services amid storms should be based on conditions at the time, but noted it also depended on whether the rail operator had the expertise to make the call. Flight operations are not solely determined by typhoon signals. Airlines can analyse the weather conditions and make decisions regarding take-offs and landings based on their own assessments, he said. Fong, who is also a meteorologist at the Macau-based ESCAPWMO Typhoon Committee under the United Nations, said No 9 signals were currently defined as weather conditions that could potentially worsen to a level meriting a No 10 warning, something the MTR Corp was aware of. It is reasonable to suspend their services partially during the No 9 alert, he said. However, if there is no strong wind during the alert in force, allowing passengers to continue their journey until reaching the end station may be worth considering.Hong Kong boy rescued as he walks 8.7km home through country park during typhoon Many commuters were forced to rely on taxis and form long queues at stands when the No 9 signal was issued on Sunday night. At the airports, travellers spoke of waiting times of more than five hours. Fong on Thursday acknowledged operating the Airport Express amid such weather might not be practical due to safety concerns, but said trains could still take stranded passengers to the nearby AsiaWorld-Expo. The Airport Authority could provide essential amenities such as food, drinks and blankets, he said. This approach could have resolved the issue without requiring other modes of transportation to take risks in providing services amid adverse weather conditions.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Former director Shun Chi-ming says suspension of rail services along open-air sections at Koinus peak on Sunday left thousands scrambling for other transport.

A significant drop-off in shipping activity at Israeli ports is threatening food security in the occupied Palestinian territories amid escalating air strikes and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) preparing for a ground invasion. On Tuesday (10 October), the World Food Programme (WFP) called for humanitarian corridors as it launched an emergency operation to supply food and water into Gaza and the West Bank. The WFP said more than 800,000 people are facing dire circumstances in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Insurance premiums for Israel-bound shipments have risen tenfold due to a squeeze on food supplies and threat of transporting goods into Israel's ports. With ships already required to pay a war risk premium for journeys to Israel, logistics and maritime security companies have scaled back operations due to tens of thousands of dollars in additional cost. The Israeli ports of Ashkelon and Ashdod have been most affected. Previously an unofficial port for food imports into Gaza, Ashkelon has suspended its regular operations, said maritime security company Dryad Global told Ship Technology, while Ashdod remains open despite a rocket assault on a nearby power plant. Humanitarian aid efforts have been further impeded by Israel's multiple aerial attacks on the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's only entry point to Egypt not controlled by Israel. Egyptian NGO Sinai for Human Rights said trucks carrying food supplies into Gaza were blocked on entry. The conflict has so far resulted in more than 2,250 deaths on both sides. Ashkelon, a small port city in range of Hamas rockets on Israel's southern coast, is not allowing ships to dock, shipping sources say. Based on AIS data, ships at the Port of Ashkelon are being redirected to the Port of Ashdod to the north, seen as a safer port, Dryad Global said. This mirrors the events of May 2021 amidst the Israel-Palestine tensions. Sirens were sounded in Ashkelon yesterday (11 October) as several people were taken to hospital with shrapnel wounds following a rocket attack. Ashdod power plant - in the vicinity of the port - has also been damaged by an aerial assault. Haifa, Israel's largest port, remains open and operational according to Indian conglomerate Adani, which acquired 70 of Haifa Port earlier this year. Haifa handles 30m tonnes of cargo, but data from MarineTraffic shows a noticeable decrease in shipping activity. A.P. Moller Maersk and Hapa Lloyd are among the European logistics companies monitoring the situation. Shipping routes run between two and four times per week between Haifa and the Turkish port of Gemlik, while southern Italian port of Gioia Tauro to Ashdod port sees between one to two routes run weekly, according to data from Fluent Cargo. Despite being only 22km north of Ashkelon and the Gaza border, Ashdod port is also still open. The port is subject to restrictions on the loading of flammable, explosive or toxic cargo due to the increased risk from rocket attacks, according to Dryad Global. Israeli company ZIM, another prominent goods transporter between Europe and Israel, announced it has offered Israel all of its ships to help with the war effort, the Jerusalem Post reported. In Israel, where nearly all food is imported from sea routes, reports have emerged of bare supermarket shelves as residents rush to stockpile supplies in the increasingly likely event of a prolonged war. Food supplies are expected to be thinly stretched, but aid already flowing in from the US and other western powers should prevent mass food insecurity. The story is different in Palestine. Despite the EU backtracking on an announcement that it would freeze all aid to Palestine on Monday (9 October), support into the West Bank and Gaza has involved backing for the Hamas regime from Iran and Hezbollah, rather than supplies for Palestinian citizens. This has not been due to lack of effort. The WFP's calls for a humanitarian corridor have so far gone unanswered, while Israel continues to block aid from Gaza's Egyptian border entry point. Earlier today, Israel's energy minister said no humanitarian supplies would reach Gaza until Hamas releases Israeli hostages. The conflict has also been a reality check for the recently proposed India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC), a plan backed by the US and EU to transport goods to Europe from the port of Haifa.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A drop-off in shipping activity at Israeli ports is threatening food security in the occupied Palestinian territories.

But it was also a notoriously head-cracking time, new research has found! It might seem like a given that organising into cities might have reduced violence among civilised early humans. But scholars are pretty divided on this matter. And some also believe that coalescing into human-dense environments might have actually led to an increase in interpersonal violence, especially when you factor in the increasing inequality among the early inhabitants. A new study provides a clearer picture. Examining 3,539 skeletons from Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Turkey revealed that many of these early inhabitants had suffered bone trauma. Strikingly enough, these were the inhabitants of some of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia and the Middle East. The ratio of interpersonal violence -- i.e. of murder -- peaked in the period of 4,500 to 3,300 years BCE and then fell back again over the course of the next 2,000 years, explains Joerg Baten, the study's project manager. Severe skull fractures and weapon wounds helped characterise the violence among the ancient skeletons. The Early and Middle Bronze Age (spanning 3,300 to 1,500 BCE) was a time of bubbling law-making, administration, trade and culture. Organisation might have helped cities achieve prosperity despite failing crop yields, while legal systems settled interpersonal disputes. The study authors think that this might have helped create the lull in violence during this time. However, peace was not going to last very long, and as cities grew bigger, so did the thirst for conquest and bloodshed. This was only exacerbated by a 300-year-old drought period in the area, leading to a surge in migratory movements. Increasing scarcity of resources and failing institutions due to climate shocks might have escalated lethal conflict levels significantly during this time. While we are just adding more passages to stories of millennia past, it does also serve excellently as a clear warning of what can happen if we fail to mitigate climate change effectively.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"3,539 skeletons from Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Turkey were examined.

Authorities on the Canary Islands have closed schools temporarily as soaring temperatures hit the 8-island archipelago. The extreme heat has also rekindled a vast wildfire on Tenerife. The Spanish island group off the northwest coast of Africa normally experiences mild, spring-like weather during the school year, so many classrooms do not have air conditioning. Recent temperatures, however, have been off the scale. Some areas of the archipelago have been scorched by 38C and higher. Reports of students fainting and suffering heatstroke prompted the closures. The mercury hit 38.5C in Adeje in the south-west of Tenerife on Monday, and 37.8C in Arucas in the north of the neighbouring island of Gran Canaria, according to Spain's meteorological agency, Aemet. Weather experts say the high temperatures are forecast to continue. In response, the Canary Islands' education minister Poli Surez announced classes would be suspended on Wednesday and Friday. Thursday is a public holiday in Spain. We want to prioritise the safety of boys and girls at all schools in the Canaries, he told reporters. The high temperatures also helped to revive a wildfire in the northeast of Tenerife, which already destroyed about 15,000 hectares of woodland over the summer. About 100 firefighters backed by nine water-dropping helicopters have been battling the blaze, the regional government of the Canaries said in a statement. The blaze first broke out in mid-August, and was declared under control on 11 September, but was never fully extinguished. Small fires have continued to ignite periodically in the same area due to winds and the heat. High temperatures make extinguishing work difficult and new reactivations are possible, the head of the regional government of Tenerife, Rosa Dvila, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The high temperatures are expected to last until Sunday. As global temperatures rise due to the climate crisis, scientists have warned that heatwaves will become more frequent and more intense.

Dozens of flights were canceled, diverted or delayed at Luton, located about 35 miles north of central London, after the blaze started late Tuesday. Four firefighters and an airport employee were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation after the fire. Officials at the airport, which is a hub for easyJet, Ryanair and other budget airlines running flights to destinations in the United Kingdom and Europe, said flights began to arrive and take off again Wednesday afternoon. Investigators believe the fire started with a diesel vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson of the Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. The recently opened parking garage did not appear to have sprinklers, he said. And then that fire has quickly and rapidly spread, Hopkinson told reporters. More than 100 firefighters were deployed to tackle the blaze, he said. Authorities said they do not believe someone started the fire intentionally. Kenya ending Cuban medical exchange NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenya's government announced Wednesday it would not be renewing a 6-year-old deal that saw Cuban doctors employed in Kenya while those from the East African country traveled to Cuba for specialized training. The program was unpopular with Kenya's main doctors union, partly because the Cuban doctors received more than double the average salary of their Kenyan counterparts. Critics argued that money would be better spent on Kenya's medical infrastructure and on its own doctors. Health Minister Nakumicha Wafula announced the end of the Cuba deal at a meeting with health industry workers in the capital, Nairobi, and was met with applause and shouts of yes, yes! Wafula said the ministry would ensure that the country's health workers are well taken care of. Under the deal signed in 2017, 50 Kenyans were sent to Cuba to undergo specialized training, while 100 Cubans were dispatched to county level hospitals in Kenya to help improve services. The move was heavily criticized at the time by legislators and the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, which said it was a waste of resources when the country was struggling with thousands of unemployed doctors and specialists. Panama bus plan aims to curb smuggling PANAMA CITY -- Panama and Costa Rica announced a plan to quickly bus thousands of migrants through Panama to the Costa Rican border, as the countries continue to grapple with a steady increase in the number of migrants moving through the jungle-clad Darien Gap. Panama estimates that 420,700 migrants have crossed the Gap from Colombia to Panama so far this year, making it likely the full-year number will top a half million. Industrial-scale smuggling operations in Colombia have now reduced the dangerous crossing to a little over two days for the strongest walkers. The expedited bus service in Panama will likely decrease further the amount of time migrants take to reach the YOU.S. border, now down to about 2 weeks. Panama hopes the new plan will disrupt the smuggling networks that charge migrants to get through the country, as well as reduce crowding at reception camps in Panama where migrants stay once they exit the Darien Gap trail. Panama's National Immigration Service said 30 buses carried a group of almost 1,600 migrants Tuesday from Panama to a Costa Rican migrant center in Corredores, just inside Costa Rica. Hurricane weakens over Mexico; 2 dead MEXICO CITY -- Lidia dissipated Wednesday after hitting land as a Category 4 hurricane near the resort of Puerto Vallarta. One person was killed by a falling tree, another drowned in a swollen river and two others were injured after the hurricane made landfall. The hurricane knocked over trees and blew roofs off houses with winds as high as 140 mph before moving inland. Laura Velzquez, the head of Mexico's civil defense system, said Wednesday that one person died on the northern outskirts of Puerto Vallarta after being hit by a falling tree, and two others were injured elsewhere in the area. The governor of Jalisco state, Enrique Alfaro, said another man drowned in a town south of where the hurricane hit when he tried to cross a swollen river late Tuesday night. The YOU.S. National Hurricane Center said Wednesday that Lidia's winds were down to 35 mph as it dissipated about 145 miles north-northeast of the city of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city and the capital of the western state of Jalisco. Lidia made landfall Tuesday on Cabo Corrientes, a sparsely populated peninsula, and then moved inland south of Puerto Vallarta with winds of 105 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Shaylee Atary and her daughter Shaya managed to flee their village Kfar Aza, ravaged by Hamas in a sickening rampage, just days before. But her husband disappeared during the massacre which saw Hamas militants armed with guns, grenades and knives kill entire families in their beds early on Saturday morning. At least 40 babies and children were slaughtered as families were burned alive in their homes, shot dead and beheaded. Shaylee, an Israeli singer, had chosen to speak to Sky News about her missing husband, Yahav Winner. In the gut-wrenching clip Shaylee holds her newborn daughter tightly as she shares fears her husband might be injured or kidnapped. A look of fear washes over her as she sees her mum on the floor in the hallway with her head in her hands. She had just been told that Yahav was dead. As Shaylee passes her newborn baby to a relative she shouts Ma, Ma!, as her mother silently crouches by the door. She then begins to sob uncontrollably in the heartbreaking footage, as her family crowds around her. Those narrating the interview footage clarify that the young mum has just been given the devastating confirmation of her husband's death. And Sky's Stuart Ramsay - who was conducting the interview - said: This is the horror of war. The family has allowed us to show this so that everyone understands what it is like. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday shared a horrific photo of a child's blood-drenched bed following the sickening rampage where Hamas reportedly beheaded babies. Netanyahu posted the harrowing picture online with the caption Hamas is worse than ISIS. The horrific photograph shared by the PM shows a child's bed sheets soaked with blood and more smeared all over the floor in a disturbing depiction of the Hamas massacre. Toys are scattered around the room and marks from what could have been an explosion cover the wall. Netanyahu later said Hamas had beheaded soldiers, raped women, shot children in the head and burned people alive during their horror attacks on Israel. Shaylee previously said she was forced to hide in a warehouse with her baby, without food or water, for 27 hours while Hamas ravaged their village. The brave mum covered herself and her baby with sacks of soil as they tried to stay hidden, but were forced to run when they heard gunmen closing in. Luckily, a family took them in and let them hide in their saferoom where they waited for rescue. Both Shaylee and her baby suffered from smoke inhalation during the ordeal but they were later taken to hospital by the IDF. She said: I really do not know where our state was. They abandoned us. They were on Twitter. That is where they were. Yahav was a filmmaker who won the best cinematography prize at this year's Tel Aviv International Students Film Festival for one of his films, according to ScreenDaily.com.

Officials warned that low river levels risk disrupting grains exports from nearby farm states. On the Madeira, they said barge routes used by grain firms such as Cargill, Bunge and Amaggi, are open but loads are being reduced as a precaution. Shipping and logistics group A.P. Moller-Maersk warned customers on Wednesday that navigation in the area of Manaus, the largest Amazonian city, was not possible. The depth of the Amazon river at its critical points has reached a level that renders maritime operations in Manaus unfeasible, the company said. Thinning Rivers Could Disrupt Amazonian Grain Exports Maersk said in a separate statement the severe drought has hit 60 of the 62 municipalities in Amazonas state, causing cabotage service to and from Manaus to be temporarily suspended. The captain of the beached boat that tugs the barge, Junior Cesar da Silva, said he had come to pick up supplies in Manaus for Borba, 280 kilometers (175 miles) away on the Madeira, an Amazon tributarywhere water levels have fallen to record lows. As we approached, we ran aground and help came too slow to re-float my boat as the water was receding very quickly, he said in an interview. The Amazon region is under pressure from the El Nino weather phenomenon, with the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon below the historical average and river levels falling near record levels. On the Madeira, beaches and rocks are appearing that we have not seen before, Da Silva said. The heat wave and drought, linked to the mass deaths of fish and river dolphins, has limited the access to supplies by local communities that depend on rivers transport in the rainforest. Cesar said store shelves were emptying out in Borba, where his barge delivers food, drinking water, cooking gas, gasoline and building materials. Brazil's government in September set up a humanitarian task force to deliver food parcels to isolated villages and Indigenous communities. On Tuesday, Indigenous groups in the Amazon asked the Brazilian government to declare a climate emergency as their villages have no drinking water, food or medicine due to a severe drought. As part of a contingency plan, Maersk's local operator Alianca Navegacao e Logstica is diverting vessels bound to Manaus to alternative ports including Vila do Conde and Pecem. Maersk's Alianca expects to reestablish service as soon as navigability conditions allow in mid-November, with restricted capacity, according to Alianca's Brazilian website. Larry Carvalho, a lawyer specializing in logistics, said freight costs were rising as ship programming was being impacted in the Amazon, with critical situations in Manaus and on the Madeira river, where grains companies move produce. Speaking to Reuters by telephone, he said higher freight costs were affecting companies that operate in the so-called Manaus Free Trade Zone area, where fiscal incentives apply to foster the industrialization of the North of Brazil.

Sunday's hate-filled and antisemitic rally in New York City, promoted by the NYC-DSA, makes it impossible for me to continue my affiliation, he added. I stand with Israel and its right to defend itself. There is no place for moral equivocation in the face of unadulterated evil as we have seen from Hamas. A spokesperson for Democratic Socialists of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night. The group has helped elect some of the most progressive members of Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York Democrat was among those who have condemned Sunday's rally. The bigotry and callousness expressed in Times Square on Sunday were unacceptable and harmful in this devastating moment, Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement first shared with Politico's New York affiliate late Monday. It also did not speak for the thousands of New Yorkers who are capable of rejecting both Hamas' horrifying attacks against innocent civilians as well as the grave injustices and violence Palestinians face under occupation. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a fellow New York Democrat, also chastised rallygoers, saying on X: I am shocked and disgusted by the rally held here in NY this weekend celebrating death or attacks on civilians and showing swastikas. I condemn any demonstration that does this in the strongest possible terms. We must proceed on the basis of recognizing our shared humanity. The Times Square rally promoted by DSA involved clashes between Palestinian activists and pro-Israel demonstrators who protested that the pro-Palestinian rally goers were antisemitic and terrorist sympathizers. NYC-DSA issued a statement Tuesday in response to the criticism. On Saturday, in anticipation of escalatory violence to come, we tweeted a promotion of a rally in solidarity with the people of Palestine. We understand why many, including our allies, were shocked by the timing and the tone of this message in a moment of profound fear and grief, the group said. We are sorry for the confusion our post caused and for not making our values explicit. At least 1,200 Israelis -- including 189 soldiers -- were killed as a result of the terrorist attack on Saturday, and more than 2,700 were injured. In Gaza, officials say at least 1,120 people have been killed and 5,300 have been injured. Thanedar said he will continue to work toward goals that he campaigned on before being elected to Congress in November, including universal healthcare, workers' rights, strong labor unions, equity for communities of color, environmental justice, and compassionate immigration. He said that ending his membership with DSA serves the interests of his constituents, saying they expect him to represent them by helping to build a better, more just world, not fanning the flames of hatred.

American and Israeli parents say they have received messages from schools, temples, synagogues and peers following the Hamas terror attack urging them to delete social media applications off their kids' phones. The warning came after the military wing of Hamas threatened to kill an Israeli hostage with every Israeli targeting of civilians in Gaza, and then broadcast the executions in audio and video. It has come to our attention that deeply disturbing videos, including footage of hostages, may be spread across social media in the near future, a principal at a public school in New York City said in an email this week, quoting from a message she said had been forwarded to her. These videos and images will likely be shared through Instagram, TikTok and other social media outlets, the email went on to say. We strongly encourage you to consider having your children delete these apps for the time being, putting up additional parental controls, andor to assist them in exercising extreme discretion around social media. The messages have been sent to parents in other YOU.S. states that are home to sizable Jewish populations, including Maryland and New Jersey. It was not immediately clear whether a particular organization was encouraging schools to send out warnings or whether schools were acting independently. David Lange, a resident of Israel who runs the Israeli advocacy group Israellycool, posted on X what he said was a screenshot of a message from parents at his daughter's school. The message, written in Hebrew and shared via WhatsApp, warned that Hamas could soon distribute hostage videos and urged parents to get rid of TikTok from their kids' devices. The warnings extended beyond the YOU.S. and Israel. JFS (also known as the Jewish Free School), a British secondary school in London, sent an email this week informing parents that administrators had warned students that Hamas could release disturbing images on social media, and suggested students delete TikTok and Instagram. In personal safety assemblies today, we have asked students to delete these applications from their phones and it is something you may wish to follow up at home, said the email, which was reviewed by NBC News. (JFS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) The exact number of Israelis abducted by Hamas gunmen remained unclear as of Wednesday afternoon. Hamas militants have claimed more than 100 people were captured, but the Israel Defense Forces estimated late Monday that more than 30 people were held by Hamas in Gaza. NBC News has not independently verified either of those claims. The messages from schools and Jewish religious institutions underscore the sense of fear that has taken root worldwide after Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel on Saturday, killing hundreds of people. Israel's counteroffensive has killed hundreds of people in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In the YOU.S. and abroad, the war between Israel and Hamas has more generally stoked anxieties about outbreaks of violence at temples, synagogues, mosques and other institutions associated with both Judaism and Islam. Police departments nationwide are ratcheting up security at potential targets. Facebook, X, TikTok and other social media services have been filled with graphic imagery out of Israel and Gaza since the weekend's violence, including videos of Israelis being kidnapped from their kibbutzim and photos of Palestinian civilians killed at their homes in Gaza. In one post on TikTok, a parent said that she has deleted any apps that could potentially lead her kids to disturbing videos, including YouTube and Apple's Safari browser. I had a talk with the kids, too, about why we were doing that, that there could be scary things coming at them through social media and through YouTube, she said in the video. If they do see something, they are not in trouble and it is not their fault, and they need to talk to us about it. TikTok, which has community guidelines barring violent content, plans to add another layer of protection to the platform amid the conflict, including additional moderation resources, blocking hashtags that promote violence and proactive fact-checking around misleading narratives, according to a spokesperson for the Chinese-owned service. X and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment Wednesday. In recent years, leading social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have come under intense scrutiny for hosting video, photo and audio content that might be harmful to teenagers and children, including images related to terrorism, gun violence, suicide and self-harm. In response, some platforms have rolled out stricter parental controls, assembled moderation teams and invested in automated systems designed to quickly spot harmful content. But debates over content moderation still roil the technology industry, intensified in part by growing politicization.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"American and Israeli parents say they have received messages from schools, temples, synagogues and peers urging them to delete social media applications off their kids' phones.

(WTVD) -- A curiously close call was reported at Gate D1 at RDU Wednesday. Air traffic control attempted to locate a possible drone that a Delta Airlines pilot said was flying just 200 feet over his plane and the runways. Former commercial pilot Tal Holloway flew for American Airlines for 33 years said the situation presented an immediate safety concern. It could be very dangerous depending on where and if it hits the airplane. If it is ingested in an engine, then you are going to probably lose that engine., said Holloway. It is a more common problem than you might think. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there were seven drone sightings in RDU airspace between January and June of this year. Airport operations and law enforcement searched the area but were not able to find anything. But Holloway says drones that enter restricted airspace almost never do so by accident. Drones are normally restricted to 400 feet and restricted from access or flying around airports, he said. So for somebody to do that, it most definitely would be somebody that is doing it with an intent. ALSO SEE: Push to ban junk and hidden fees could save you money Holloway said drones present an added danger. Their small size makes them difficult for air traffic controllers to spot-- leaving pilots responsible for reporting them -- and potentially averting disaster. Yeah, that is I hate to say, common but what happens is when somebody does spot an object, you report it to air traffic control so they can investigate it and they can warn any other pilots in the area, Holloway said. The FAA said they receive more than 11 drone sightings a month and it is a problem they forecast will get worse. The agency says there are currently over 863,000 registered drones in the United States but they predict there be over 2.5 million by the year 2026.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Delta Airlines pilot says drone was flying just 200 feet over his plane and the runways.

According to the report, there were 99 incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the first nine months of 2023, marking an increase from 90 incidents during the same period in 2022. Among the reported incidents, 85 vessels were boarded, nine had attempted attacks, three were hijacked, and two were fired upon. The perpetrators successfully boarded 89 of the targeted vessels, with most incidents occurring at night. While the reported violence towards crew members is relatively low compared to the past three decades, there remains a real risk to crew safety. In the first nine months of 2023, 69 crew members were taken hostage, 14 were kidnapped, eight were threatened, three were injured, and one was assaulted. IMB Director Michael Howlett expressed concern over the rise in reported incidents in the Gulf of Guinea. The Gulf of Guinea stands as a region of concern with a rise in reported incidents, as opposed to the downward trend we have seen in the past two years, said Howlett. The IMB sees regional ownership as critical to safeguard shipping and trade and to address these crimes. Gulf of Guinea The report showed an increase in reported incidents in the Gulf of Guinea, with 21 incidents recorded in the first nine months of 2023, compared to 14 incidents during the same period in 2022. Among these incidents, 17 were classified as armed robberies and four as piracy. The safety of crew members is a mounting concern, as 54 were taken hostage, 14 were kidnapped, and two were injured. Singapore Straits The Singapore Straits also raised concerns, with 33 reported incidents in the first nine months of 2023, compared to 31 incidents during the same period last year. Out of these incidents, 31 vessels were boarded, five crew members were taken hostage, and two were threatened. The majority of incidents were reported in July, with ship stores or properties being the primary target for theft. The navigational challenges of the Singapore Straits further compound the risks posed by these incidents, potentially affecting safe navigation in these congested waters. IMB emphasizes the importance of early reporting of incidents, even low-level opportunistic ones, to protect seafarers and ensure the safety of regional and international shipping and trade. The organization commends local authorities for their efforts in investigating nearly all reported incidents. Indonesian Archipelago and South America The IMB's report also highlighted an increase in the number of incidents in the Indonesian archipelagic region, with 12 incidents reported during the first nine months of 2023, compared to 10 incidents during the same period in 2020 and seven incidents in 2021. Knives were sighted in five out of the 12 reported incidents. Furthermore, reports from Callao Anchorage in Peru increased to 13 incidents from eight during the same period in 2022.

Lincoln County District Judge Traci Soderstrom, 50, should be removed from her position and disqualified from holding any judicial office in the state, a petition filed Tuesday by Oklahoma Supreme Court Chief Justice John Kane argued. It alleged Soderstrom was captured on camera scrolling Facebook and accessing phone applications during the trial, and argued she should be removed from office because her actions showed gross neglect of duty, gross partiality in office and oppression in office. During the June murder trial of a man accused in the beating death of a child, the judge and her bailiff exchanged more than 500 text messages, according to the petition. The totality of the text messages give the appearance Respondent believed the defendant was innocent and that she wanted a particular outcome in the case, the petition said. Khristian Martzall was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in the 2018 death of Braxton Danker, his girlfriend's son, and sentenced to four years with credit for time served. He served no additional jail time, according to the petition. Martzall's girlfriend pleaded guilty to enabling child abuse and was sentenced to 25 years, the petition said. Security video published by The Oklahoman newspaper showed Soderstrom texting or messaging for minutes at a time during jury selection, opening statements and testimony. In one instance, when Martzall's girlfriend was called as a witness in his trial, Soderstrom texted, Can I please scream liar liar? according to the petition. When District Attorney Adam Panter was addressing the jury, the judge texted the bailiff that Panter was sweating through his coat, to which the bailiff replied, He is gross and a horrible speaker, according to the petition. In another text exchange, Soderstrom said the jury would hate the assistant district attorney, to which the bailiff replied, Absolutely. He is an arrogant a------, the petition said. The Bailiff then made a crass and demeaning reference to the prosecuting attorney's genitals, to which the Respondent the judge replied with a 'Ha Ha' icon, the petition said. In another exchange about Panter's appearance, Soderstrom texted her bailiff, Why does he have baby hands? ... They are so weird looking. In contrast, when texting about a defense attorney, Soderstrom said, She is awesome. With the bailiff agreeing and responding, She is so smart, according to the petition. Soderstrom was elected in November 2022, and took the bench in January, according to the petition. Neither Soderstrom nor her attorney responded to requests for comment Wednesday. Soderstrom has been suspended with pay pending the outcome of a hearing by the Court on the Judiciary, which will decide whether to remove her from the bench. According to the petition, Soderstrom and the bailiff also discussed an instruction to the jury to consider second-degree manslaughter in the Martzall case. The pair discussed the sentencing punishments between second-degree manslaughter, compared to a charge of enabling child abuse, which the judge explained over text was a much longer sentence than the two-to-four-year sentence for manslaughter. Ahhh. And he is already served that, the bailiff said. To which, the judge responded, yes. When Soderstrom testified before the Council on Judicial Complaints, which investigated the allegations and subpoenaed her personal cell phone records, she said her texting probably could have waited, rather than not be made at all, the petition said. Panter, the district attorney, did not respond to an NBC News request for comment Wednesday. In a statement to The Oklahoman, Panter said, It is now well publicized that Judge Soderstrom spent many hours of a murder trial involving the brutal beating death of a child, glued to her cell phone on social media rather than pay attention to the evidence. He continued: But what is ... in my opinion even more obscene is that now we are aware from the allegations that Judge Soderstrom actively attempted to undermine the State's ability to successfully prosecute a child killer.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Lincoln County District Judge Traci Soderstrom, 50, should be removed from her position, a petition says.

The White House has faced bipartisan pressure in the days since Hamas attacked Israel to block Iran from accessing any of the 6 billion, particularly as the YOU.S. tries to assess whether Iran had any direct involvement in the attack. Follow along with lives updates on the Israel-Hamas war here. These funds should remain frozen until we can determine whether Iran played a role in the attack and what the appropriate YOU.S. response should be, Sen. Bob Casey, D-PA, said in a statement on Wednesday. Critics of the White House's decision to give Iran access to the 6 billion argue that money is fungible and any funds Iran receives for humanitarian assistance frees up more money for Tehran to spend on nefarious activities in the Middle East. Administration officials, while suggesting that freezing the 6 billion is on the table, have not said what the trigger for doing so would be or how that process would work. Re-freezing the Iranian funds also could have an effect on the administration's efforts to negotiate future deals for other wrongfully detained Americans abroad. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday said that none of the 6 billion in unfrozen Iranian oil revenue has been spent, while declining to say if the administration would seek to re-freeze it. Jon Finer, the deputy national security adviser, told Jewish leaders in a call Tuesday that, if necessary, we have options available to us if it is not spent for the purpose to which it is restricted. Iran cannot directly access the funds on its own, according to YOU.S. officials, who stress that the money is sitting in a Qatari bank and intended only for humanitarian use. The officials insist there are already several safeguards in place to ensure the money is not misused, including monitoring by the YOU.S. Treasury Department and by the Qataris as well. Any approved withdrawal for items such as food, medicine and agricultural equipment would be monitored by both entities, officials said. The funds had been held in a South Korean bank previously under a mechanism that allowed Iran to keep selling oil to South Korea and several other countries. YOU.S. sanctions had prohibited Iran from accessing the money. The funds in Qatar are subject to identical restrictions as the funds in South Korea and may only be used for the same types of humanitarian trade. Such transfers are consistent with our Iran sanctions, which include longstanding authorizations and exceptions for the provision of humanitarian goods and assistance to Iran, one of the administration officials said. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told NBC News' Lester Holt in an interview last month that his government would spend the money wherever we need it. The YOU.S. has pledged to take action immediately if it notices Iran using the money for anything other than the stated humanitarian purposes, the official added. That money can be frozen at any time, we can stop any transaction, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications Adm. John Kirby said on MSNBC on Tuesday. The YOU.S. government has accused Iran of funding and arming Hamas since the 1990s. So far, administration officials have said they have not found a smoking gun that directly links Iran to Saturday's attack in Israel. Over the weekend, Biden administration officials pushed back on accusations from Republicans that the 6 billion had been used to fuel the attack by Hamas in Israel, saying Iran had not yet accessed any of the money. It is very unfortunate that some are playing political at a time when so many lives have been lost, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday. These were not YOU.S. taxpayer dollars. These were Iranian resources that it had accumulated from the sale of its oil that were stuck in a bank in South Korea.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,The White House is reserving the option to halt Iran's access to 6 billion it is set to receive.

Pat Ryan to introduce resolution demanding Tuberville lift hold on military nominations amid Israel-Hamas war,"Tuberville said he will not back down on his monthslong blockade on hundreds of military promotions despite the ongoing war. A Democratic House member on Wednesday afternoon will introduce a resolution formally demanding Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., to lift his monthslong blockade on hundreds of military promotions amid the deadly Israel-Hamas war after his office said he will not budge. In a statement, Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., a vice-ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, decried Tuberville's blockade as a threat to the lives of Israelis and YOU.S. troops amid the ongoing war. Our most critical ally is fighting an existential war for their nation's survival. Yet MAGA extremists, led by Tommy Tuberville, are more concerned with waging a culture war, endangering both our Israeli allies and our own troops, Ryan said. The people of Israel are depending on us. China, Iran, and Russia are watching for signs of weakness, he added. We must stand together as patriots and show the forces of evil around the world that there is no greater friend and no worse foe than the United States of America. While noting the Biden administration's recent move to send ships from the Navy's USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Ryan pointed out that the fleet lacks a Senate-confirmed commander as a result of the Tuberville-led blockade on military nominations. Ryan, a combat veteran and former Army Intelligence Officer, also noted that the more than 300 confirmations that are currently in limbo include several critical command positions that are needed to carry out commitments by the YOU.S. to support Israeli allies as the war rages on. These are crucial positions needed to ensure that the state of Israel has the support it needs, stranded American citizens receive the help they require, and the United States is able to help deter the possibility of a catastrophic escalation of this war to other fronts by Hezbollah, Iran, or others, he said. This is a moment where the YOU.S. must stand strongly and unequivocally with the State of Israel, ensuring we have a lethal and ready force in an existential fight. Reached for comment, Tuberville's office pointed to the House-passed defense bill which would restrict the Pentagon's abortion policy. It is clear that the House majority stands with Coach, Tuberville spokesperson Steve Stafford said. Ryan's resolution comes days after the office of Tuberville said he will not lift his blockade on hundreds of military promotions in the wake of Hamas' deadly attack on Israel, a close YOU.S. ally, last weekend. The Pentagon clearly thinks forcing taxpayers to facilitate abortion is more important than confirming their top nominees without a vote. They could end this situation TODAY by dropping their illegal and immoral policy and get everyone confirmed rapidly, but they refuse, Stafford said in a statement to NBC News on Sunday. If the Biden administration wants their nominees confirmed then Senate Democrats can do what Coach just did in September and file a cloture petition to force a vote. Coach refers to Tuberville's previous work as a college football coach. Tuberville's monthslong blockade has held up at least 300 military nominees, including top officers who would command forces in the Middle East. He said his move is in protest of the Defense Department policy that provides time off and reimbursements for service members and their family members seeking abortions out of state. Tuberville has faced backlash from Democrats and the White House, who said that his use of a procedural tactic to slow down the confirmation of military officials poses a threat to the military's preparedness. Although he cannot actually block the Senate from processing military promotions, his hold has significantly slowed down a process that typically moves forward without votes. Tuberville and some Republicans have argued that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., could call each of the hundreds of nominations for individual votes -- which could potentially involve hours of floor time for each nominee. The Senate last month used that strategy to confirm its first military nominees in months -- Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top military officer; Gen. Randy George as Army chief of staff; and Gen. Eric Smith as commandant of the Marine Corps. As of Wednesday morning, at least 1,200 Israelis -- including more than 150 soldiers -- have been killed and more than 2,700 injured, according to the Israel Defense Forces. At least 1,100 people in Gaza have been killed and 5,000 injured, according to the health ministries in Gaza and the West Bank. President Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday called Hamas' attacks vicious and vowed support for Israel in the face of pure, unadulterated evil. He also confirmed that Americans are being held hostage by Hamas fighters, but did not specify how many. He is set to deliver remarks on the crisis later Wednesday. 22 Americans have been killed and 17 Americans remain unaccounted for, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said Wednesday. As of Wednesday morning, Israel said its fighter jets have struck 450 targets in Gaza in 24 hours after its military claimed to regained control inside the country after it launched a full siege of Gaza that restricted food, gas and power from the densely populated area. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said that fighting will intensify and warned that scenes coming out of Gaza would be difficult to understand and cope with.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., a vice-ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, decried Tuberville's blockade as a threat to the lives of Israelis and YOU.S. troops amid the ongoing war. Ryan also noted that the more than 300 confirmations that are currently in limbo include several critical command positions that are needed to support Israeli allies as the war rages on. We must stand together as patriots and show the forces of evil around the world that there is no greater friend and no worse foe than the United States of America, Ryan said."

Hollman died on August 10 after former Officer Kiran Kimbrough used a stun gun on him and then handcuffed him following a minor traffic accident. Kimbrough was fired by the Atlanta Police Department because he did not follow standard operating procedures, police said Tuesday. Arnitra Fallins, her family and their attorney met with the city last month to view footage of the incident. It was very heartbreaking, Fallins said Wednesday. Her father had called her during the encounter. I might have made it through two minutes of the video because once I saw my daddy dialing my number and once this officer grabbed him, that pissed me off, it did something to me to the point where it literally made me sick to my stomach, she said. It was very disturbing. The family has called for the footage to be publicly released. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has asked the police department not to release the video until it completes its investigation. Relatives said that Hollman was driving home from Bible study at a daughter's house and taking dinner to his wife when he was involved in a car accident. He called police to the scene, the family said. The Atlanta Police Department said in its initial statement that Hollman became agitated and uncooperative when the officer found him to be the at-fault driver and issued him a citation. Authorities said he resisted as the officer attempted to take him into custody and a struggle ensued. After several minutes of struggling, the officer used his stun gun and then placed Hollman in handcuffs, according to police. It was then that the officer realized that Hollman was unresponsive and requested EMS. An autopsy determined Hollman's manner of death was a homicide. The medical examiner said heart disease contributed to his death. Mawuli Davis, an attorney for the family, disputed police's version of what happened and said the video showed that Kimbrough escalated the situation and that his actions were both unreasonable and illegal. In the video, according to Davis, Kimbrough approached Hollman and told him that he was getting a citation. Hollman told Kimbrough that he had the right-of-way and showed the officer the damage to his vehicle, Davis said. When the officer told Hollman that he was at fault for the crash, Hollman asked him to call for a sergeant, according to Davis. The attorney said that the officer ignored Hollman's request and instead instructed him to sign the citation. That is when Hollman called Fallins, Davis said. As Hollman dialed his daughter's number, Kimbrough allegedly reached for him. As he is reaching for him, Deacon Hollman says, 'I will sign the ticket.' And then he repeats it, 'I will sign the ticket. I will sign the ticket.' The officer, ignoring his willingness to comply, does a leg sweep and takes him to the ground, Davis said. And Deacon Hollman is saying, 'I cannot breathe. My asthma is acting up on me, I cannot breathe.' Fallins described hearing her father plead with the officer. I could hear him screaming and hollering for help. I could hear him saying he could not breathe. I could hear him saying his asthma was acting up, she said. Then it got to a point on my drive over there that I did not hear my father yell out for help anymore. In my spirit, I felt like something went wrong. Davis said at one point during the altercation, Kimbrough is on top of Hollman and strikes him with a closed fist. He said they counted Hollman say as many as 16 times, I cannot breathe. Police declined to comment on the case, saying in a statement Wednesday that the investigation is ongoing and there is nothing further to release at this time. Davis accused Kimbrough of being overly aggressive and said the family wants the officer to be charged. We believe that what we witnessed on that video is murder. It was an unjustifiable homicide, he said. The family is still struggling with the death. We are still hurting. We should not be going to the cemetery. We should be sitting around laughing and talking with our daddy, we should still be hearing 'I love you, baby,' Fallins said, calling her father a God-fearing man and a leader in his community. I do not want people to get distracted by what the APD and the City is putting out about him, about being combative, about being aggressive, that is not in my daddy's character. That is not who he was and that is not what he was presenting that night he was killed.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Johnny Hollman, 62, died on August 10 after an Atlanta police officer used a stun gun on him and then handcuffed him following a minor traffic accident.

That is what kept me going, Ricardo said Wednesday in a telephone interview. I sat with her boyfriend's mother and we planned their wedding, she said, describing how she passed the endless days since she learned her daughter was missing. On Tuesday, Ricardo says Oriya's boyfriend drove to the site of the festival to search the area of her last cellphone ping. He found her body there. She had attempted to escape with a friend but her friend was shot as they drove away. The last communication with her boyfriend was about her friend as he died in her arms. After that, she tried to flee on foot and was killed. They got her, Ricardo said. They are monsters full of hate, ignorance and they are there for the killing, Ricardo said of Hamas. Hope has given way to frustration and anger as families wait for the more than 260 massacred at the Supernova music festival to be identified and for their remains to be returned for burial. For Diana Kupervaser, it took five excruciating days of silence from authorities before she learned her daughter Shani was among the dead. It is like she vanished, Kupervaser told NBC News on Monday before she would learned the fate of her daughter, who had attended the music festival in the Negev desert near the Gaza border. Without any information, Kupervaser held out hope that Shani might be alive in Gaza. But on Wednesday, as she sheltered in place in the northern city of Haifa, amid sirens and threats of rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah, she was notified that 27-year-old Shani had been killed. To see my mother banging her head when she got the horrible news, said Shani's uncle Victor Volam, it is a sight I will not forget for the rest of my life. The family of Shira Eylon, 23, also learned Wednesday she had been identified among the dead. Her body was found in the woods surrounding the music festival. Video reviewed by NBC News shows dozens of festival attendees seeking protection in shrubs and trees. Survivors have described being hunted by Hamas, staying silent and trying to camouflage themselves in hopes of remaining undetected. Eylon last called her father around 7 a.m. saying she was terrified as bombs began to fall. She was too scared to drive, and decided to wait for 30 minutes hoping the situation would calm down. Just before her phone was disconnected, Shira texted her dad saying she could hear gunfire. That was it. We lost connection with her, her sister Adar Eylon said. We could not find her. The country was in complete chaos -- no one would give us information. Shira's friends survived but lost track of her, and they later described the scene to her family. They told me it felt like the Holocaust -- Jews running away from Nazis, Eylon said through tears Wednesday. She described her sister as being very special, independent and mature. I feel like everybody has a part in this world, and her part was to spread kindness, Eylon said, adding that she is considering moving out of Israel WHERE DOES SHE LIVE? because she fears growing violence. There are still an unknown number of festivalgoers missing, but families continue to hope for news that their loved ones might be among those still alive -- even if that means they are being held hostage in Gaza. We hope he is somewhere hiding in the bushes, one distraught uncle said of his nephew over the phone. But as the days wear on, more and more people have gotten the news that their loved ones were killed. It is like something is ripped out of your chest, Hannie Ricardo said.

The blaze caused the building to suffer a significant structural collapse. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service believed the because was accidental. The fire started at about 20:45 BST and no serious injuries were reported. Tens of thousands of passengers are believed to have been affected by flight delays. The first commercial flights resumed just after 15:00 BST. Four firefighters and a member of airport staff were treated for the effects of breathing in smoke as they battled the huge blaze. It broke out on level three of the terminal two car park and was thought to have started in a diesel car and spread rapidly. One witnessed said he saw an explosion on the roof of the car park followed by a flame that shot across the car park like a flamethrower. After that, he saw cars exploding every few minutes. Firefighters remain on site working with the airport fire service, monitoring hot spots. The car park is believed to hold up to 1,900 vehicles and hundreds of cars may have been damaged. An investigation into the because of the fire is continuing. Andy Hopkinson, Bedfordshire's chief fire officer, said the service had no intelligence than to suggest it was anything other than an accidental fire. He said it was thought the fire started in a diesel-powered car and then spread through the building. The car park did not appear to have sprinklers, according to Mr Hopkinson, and he said a recommendation for sprinklers in any redevelopment would be made to the airport. He explained to reporters that the car park's open sides would have allowed the fire to spread horizontally before it went up through the building. A ramp would be installed on the unaffected part of the car park to help remove unaffected vehicles, he added. He said: There is a substantial number that are not damaged and our focus as well is can we remove those vehicles safely without causing any danger to the responders? The airport said passengers arriving by car could now use the long and mid-stay car parks, while a temporary drop-off was established at the mid-stay car park However, the DART shuttle remained closed and replacement buses were in operation. Travel expert and broadcaster Simon Calder said: I have calculated that there are between 40,000 and 50,000 people who will have their travel plans wrecked today. Declan Dever, from Westport in Ireland, said: It is no-one's fault - just have to grin and bear it. He was trying to get back home for his brother's 80th birthday, after his 11:00 flight was cancelled. The 65-year-old said he was lucky not to be in a rush but added I feel sorry for people, I see children in there asleep on the ground, I feel sorry for that. London Luton is the UK's fifth largest airport after Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted, carrying more than 13 million passengers in 2022. The region's ambulance service said a critical incident was stood down but it would remain on scene to support fire and rescue colleagues. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said 15 engines were sent to the airport. A passenger who was on board a plane that was due to take off as the fire broke out said: We were all just told to get off the flight, that there was an incident and then we were left in the airport with no proper explanation. Two hours later, they were told there was a major incident and that they would need to leave the airport. It was all a little bit confusing, because I do not think the staff knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing, they added. Russell Taylor, 41, an account director, saw the flames after flying in to Luton from Edinburgh. He told the PA news agency: There were a couple of fire engines with a car ablaze on the upper floor of the car park at just after 21:00 A few minutes later most of the upper floor was alight, car alarms were going off with loud explosions from cars going up in flames. Hundreds of people were stranded, with many saying their cars were in the car park. Helen Jocelyne, from Exmouth in Devon, was returning to Luton from Burgas in Bulgaria when her plane was diverted to Stansted in Essex, an hour before it was due to land. She said a coach took her to Luton, but she had to walk to the car park with her luggage. I do not even know if we can get our car out yet, she said. Another passenger, Jason Harris, was supposed to be landing from Egypt. Three hours into his flight he said passengers were informed by the pilot that the fire meant they would be diverted to Bristol Airport. He got a taxi from Bristol to Luton, provided by airline EasyJet, and had to get a second taxi to his home in Stevenage in neighbouring Hertfordshire. He said: Nightmare all round, I know there is been a fire at the airport but you would think they would have a back road for a way out, but it cannot be done. The airport said in a statement on Tuesday night additional staff were on hand to provide assistance to passengers. Jareena Sarabatta and her husband Gian were due to to fly to Turkey to celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary. They believed that they might be able to fly later in the evening but had not heard from their airline. Mrs Sarabatta said: It is no-one's fault what has happened but there should at least be someone to pick up the phone. However, she was grateful they were not in the car park when the fire started. Airline provider EasyJet, based at Luton, issued a statement apologising for the inconvenience. It added that it would be providing hotel accommodation and meals for passengers where required. Wizz Air, a Hungarian airline which has its UK base at Luton, warned passengers to expect cancellations and disruptions. The first commercial plane to arrive at the airport after the fire was a Wizz Air service from Cardiff. Charlotte Vere, the Conservative minister for aviation, maritime and security, said she was very grateful to emergency service staff who worked hard to put out the fire.

Shaylee Atary and her daughter Shaya escaped after more than 24 hours of hiding after Hamas terrorists tried to break into their home in the Kfar Aza kibbutz - where gunmen savagely massacred families, including 40 children in an attack which has shocked the world. The Israeli singer was speaking to Sky News about her husband, Yahav Winner, who had been missing since the kibbutz of about 750 people - popular with young parents - came under attack from some 70 Hamas terrorists at dawn. Footage - which the family has given permission to be aired to highlight the horrific consequences of war - shows Ms Atary clutching her one-month-old newborn as she tells reporters that her husband could be 'injured somewhere' or 'kidnapped'.

The young woman repeatedly shouts 'Ma, Ma' as her mother stays silent - but other family members take the newborn from her hands so she can find out what has happened. She then starts to wail uncontrollably as relatives unite in grief and gather around her. A narrator on the video reveals that Ms Atary has just received the dreaded news that her husband was dead. Sky's chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay - who was conducting the interview - said: This is the horror of war. The family has allowed us to show this so that everyone understands what it is like. In a separate interview earlier this week, Ms Atary had revealed how she had to hide in a warehouse with her baby with no food or water for 27 hours while Hamas militants carried out a horrifying massascre. The mother and daughter suffered from smoke inhalation but they were eventually rescued by the IDF to a hospital. The terror at Kfar Aza began just after dawn when most of the 400 residents living there were sleeping or enjoying their breakfast with coffee. The first wave of 70 terrorists had roared towards the quiet kibbutz on motorbikes after tearing through the border wire a mile away, while others paraglided over Israel's unsuspecting defences from Gaza. Israeli soldiers walk beside the bodies of Hamas militant killed in Kfar Aza kibbutz on Tuesday Troops remove the bodies of victims, killed during an attack by Hamas terrorists in Kfar Aza, on Tuesday As soon as they arrived, the heavily armed fighters attacked the compound from four directions - starting with the 'baby quarter' on the west side where all the young families lived. The terrorists were met by a frantic kibbutz guard, a small group of residents with military experience, who were patrolling the perimeter when they saw the swarm of black figures racing towards them. They - like the Israeli military and government - were not prepared for the wave of terrorists firing streams of bullets at them. The small security squad tried in vain to protect their neighbours but they could not hold the terrorists off and were killed in the fighting. The ruthless Hamas gunmen moved quickly through the kibbutz, first killing a 90-year-old grandmother who had been sitting on her porch when the terrorists arrived. They dragged the terrified pensioner into her living room and shot her twice in the head. Families were woken to the terrifying sound of gunfire and voices outside their homes. Terrified parents ran to their sleeping children and pulled them from their beds and cots before bundling them into saferooms or cupboards. Among those parents were Itay and Hadar Berichevsky, both 30, who heard the gunmen trying to smash down their front door. The terrified parents frantically put their ten-month-old twin babies into a hidden shelter moments before the Hamas terrorists stormed into their home and shot the couple dead. Itay and Hadar Berdichevsky (pictured with babies), both 30, had mere seconds to react when they heard the gunmen trying to smash down their front door The terrified parents frantically bundled their two babies into a hidden shelter moments before Hamas terrorists shot the couple dead The terrorists then moved systematically from home to home, blowing open front doors with their rocket-powered grenades and unleashing a hail of bullets at the men, women and children living there. Entire families had been handcuffed before they were shot point blank one by one, soldiers said. It would later emerge that as many as 40 babies and young children were massacred in this kibbutz, some of them beheaded, according to Israeli soldiers. Harrowing images from the scene show a baby's car seat covered with blood, her small bloodied dress lying next to it. The Hamas gunmen set fire to several homes in the kibbutz in a sick attempt to force the families out so that they could gun them down as soon as they reached their garden. 'Many preferred to die in the fires, than be killed by the terrorists,' Omar Barak, a 24-year-old Israeli army officer, told the Times of Israel. Some had tried to flee the terrorists, but many were gunned down mercilessly - their bodies lying on the grass in front of their homes. One survivor told EuroNews: 'The terrorists came into every home, into every home, every place. They would burn their house with them inside so they would die. 'They shot children, babies, old people, anyone. No one was safe from it. The first victim was a 90-year-old woman who was sitting on her porch. She saw them coming and she got shot.'

Blood and cracked cups covered their kitchen floor. One of the few who managed to flee was filmmaker Shaylee Atary, who told Israeli media how her husband Yahav Winner had helped her and their one-month-old daughter escape their home as the gunmen entered the small building. Shaylee says she ran into a storeroom before covering her and her baby, Shaya, with sacks of soil. When she heard the gunmen getting closer again, she ran across the lawn as the terrorists fired at her. She was taken in by a family who let her hide in their saferoom, where they waited for 27 hours until they were rescued. The young mother has since been told that her husband was killed by the terrorists. 'I really do not know where our state was,' Shaylee said. 'They abandoned us. They were on Twitter. That is where they were.' It took the Israeli army 12 hours to reach the kibbutz, said officer Davidi Ben Zion, the deputy commander of paratrooper team Unit 71. But the carnage did not end there. The terrorists fought hard to keep control of the kibbutz, killing civilians and firing bullets at the soldiers. Soldiers told the BBC how it was 'chaos, terrorists everywhere' as soon as they arrived in the kibbutz. 'You cannot imagine how difficult the fighting was,' one said.

Israeli soldiers went from home to home, hoping to find survivors. Astonishingly, the ten-month-old twin babies bundled into a hidden shelter by Itay and Hadar Berdichevsky were rescued by Israeli soldiers and taken to their grandmother. What is left of the utter carnage that the Hamas terrorists unleashed on this small community is the bullet-riddled bodies of parents and their children and the charred remains of their homes. Throughout the town, walls and torched cars are riddled with bullet holes, tracing a path of violence that continues inside to bedrooms with mattresses spattered in blood, safe rooms that could not withstand the attack There were so many victims, feared to be around 150, that soldiers and the mortuary teams spent hours collecting all of their bodies. They wrapped the small bodies of young children butchered by the terrorists, before placing them into body bags that were too large. The Israeli soldiers were seen comforting each other after witnessing such horrors, including the bodies of entire families who were gunned down in their beds. 'You see the babies, the mothers, the fathers in their bedrooms and how the terrorists killed. It is not a battlefield. It is a massacre,' Israeli Major General Itai Veruv said as he stood at the entrance of the kibbutz. 'I have served as a combat soldier and officer for 39 years,' Veruv continued. 'I have never seen anything that comes close to this. It is not even something that our parents knew. This is something out of the world of our grandfathers back in Europe, from the pogroms and the Holocaust. Veruv had arrived at Kfar Aza on Saturday to join the fighting but on Tuesday he gathered the world's press to show them what happened there. 'When I discovered what had happened here, I remembered how General Eisenhower, when the American army liberated concentration camps in Germany, immediately brought the media so the world would know,' Veruv said, his eyes red. The stench of bodies was heavy in the air as the soldiers showed journalists the kibbutz, popular amongst families. The small football nets where children would have played football were seen on a pocket of grass - but in the background, the bodies of families were laid on the ground. Major David Ben Zion, 37, a reservist called up to try to rescue any survivors, told The Independent: 'We saw dead babies, girls. We succeeded in saving some of them but we found most dead in their houses. They came with just one mission - to kill more and more of our people.' Outside one of the small houses of the kibbutz. the body of a resident was covered by a purple sheet with a bare foot protruding. A pillow and other objects from the house lay scattered. Elsewhere bodies of the gunmen lay face down on the ground. A destroyed gate at the perimeter of the kibbutz showed where the gunmen had entered. Military spokesman Maj Doron Spielman compared the toll in Kfar Aza and nearby villages he visited to scenes he witnessed as a New Yorker after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 'I remember going through 911 and waking up the next day, the next week, and everything had changed,' he said. 'It is the same thing again. But worse because we are such a small country.' The threat did not end with the Hamas terrorists being shot dead. Soldiers took 30 to 40 minutes going through each home due to the number of unexploded grenades strewn across the floor. And soldiers were still securing the paths of the kibbutz, which had single-storey houses with verandas, palm trees and banana plants, as bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard in the distance. In one part of the kibbutz, where residents had kept the lawns tidy outside their modest homes, lay the ruins of a motorised glider used by the militants to fly over the border. Next to it lay a crumpled Hamas flag in the dirt. Kfar Aza, surrounded by farms and just a few minutes down a country road from the heavily fortified fence Israel erected around Gaza, was one of more than 20 towns and villages attacked by Palestinian fighters early Saturday. For the younger soldiers who had fought their way through the kibbutz, they were unable to talk about what they saw. 'We have a long war ahead of us now,' one soldier said.

Shaylee Atary and her daughter Shaya escaped after more than 24 hours of hiding while Hamas terrorists tried to break into their home in the Kfar Aza kibbutz - where gunmen massacred families, including 40 children, in an attack which has shocked the world. The Israeli singer was being interviewed by Sky News about her husband, Yahav Winner, who had been missing since the kibbutz - popular with young parents - came under attack from some 70 Hamas terrorists at dawn on Saturday. Footage - which the family has given permission to be aired to highlight the horrors of war - shows Ms Atary clutching her one-month-old newborn as she tells reporters that her filmmaker husband could be 'injured somewhere' or 'kidnapped'. During the interview, Ms Atary then appears to speak to her mother, who has dropped to the floor in the hallway with her head in her hands after receiving a sickening update in a phone call from the Israel Defence Forces.

The new visa waiver status for Israel was announced by the Department of Homeland Security in late September, and officials tell NBC News they do not plan to speed up the launch of the program. Adi Rosenbaum, 35, spoke from the Tel Aviv apartment she shares with her husband and her two young daughters. They want to go to Manhattan to stay with her sister, but her 1-year-old does not have a YOU.S visa. Her husband went to the YOU.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv this week to apply for a visa for the baby, but said it was closed. She said the family has called and emailed without success. Rosenbaum broke down in tears, confused by the YOU.S. government's failure to move up the start date for the visa waiver program. If there is anyway the YOU.S. government can help Jewish people so we will not get slaughtered, please help, she said. We are just lost. We have no idea how to make it happen. The videos will not leave my mind. I do not want my kids to see my crying. I hope things do not escalate, she said. We are just trying to make it here until the end of November. We are trying to be strong to my girls. We are praying for this to end. A State Department spokesperson said that the embassy branches in Israel are prioritizing helping YOU.S. citizens: At this time, visa processing at the YOU.S. Embassy in Israel has been suspended and visa appointments have been cancelled. Visa applicants should monitor the YOU.S. Embassy website for updates. Visas require in-person appointments. The embassy website states, All in-person Passport Unit appointments are by online appointment only. No consular appointments are made by phone or email. No walk-ins are permitted. One DHS official told NBC News that visa-free travel for Israeli citizens and nationals will not begin immediately due to operational steps that must be taken prior to the commencement of travel. Said the official, We expect that starting no later than November 30, 2023, the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) will be updated to allow Israelis to apply to travel to the United States for tourism or business for up to 90 days without obtaining a YOU.S. visa. Another DHS official said the administration has no plans at this time to open other expeditious pathways for Israelis seeking to flee to the YOU.S. such as Special Immigrant Visas and humanitarian parole, both of which were recently made available to people escaping violence in Afghanistan and Ukraine. Forty other countries have a reciprocal visa waiver program agreement with the YOU.S., which means red tape for travelers is limited. Countries with agreements include Australia, Japan and nearly every nation in Europe. The visa waiver program is a reciprocal arrangement, in which a citizen of one country is granted a visa waiver when traveling to the other country. Former YOU.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides described how a new waiver program would work in a January Twitter post, saying that once the program is implemented Israelis would be able to travel to the United States with no visa. He added, Any American regardless of their national origin, religion or ethnicity will be able to travel to Israel, for an example Arab-Americans including Palestinian- Americans will be able to get on a plane and fly directly to Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv and go see your aunt in Bethlehem. Yotam Lior, 40, and his wife, Rachel Forbes, decided that they could not wait for visa approval to get to the United States with their two children. The family chose to flee to Cyprus amid warnings from the Israeli government that they needed to conserve food and water in the coming weeks. Lior spoke to NBC News from the Tel Aviv airport, where he was juggling his two young children as he waited for his Cyprus flight. The YOU.S. is sending battleships and aircraft carriers to Israel, but Israeli citizens still have to go through this tedious process. If you ask me it does not benefit anyone. Forbes told NBC News she feels they had no choice but to leave because they fear they are in danger, It is a real war and Israel is in serious risk, she said. We are attacked from north to south with an enemy that has nothing to lose. In early September, 15 Senate Democrats wrote a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken opposing the addition of Israel to the visa waiver program, citing Israel's request for a special separate visa category for residents of the West Bank or Gaza.

The new allegations about the unsolved heist, which occurred at the airport on the evening of April 17, were found in a statement of claim filed by Brink's with the Federal Court of Canada on October 6. In the company's claim, Brink's said shortly after the valuables landed at Pearson and the cargo was offloaded, an unknown person was able to gain access to the airline's cargo storage facilities. No security protocols or features were in place to monitor, restrict or otherwise regulate the unidentified individual's access to the facilities, the statement of claim read. Brink's alleges that Air Canada accepted a fake waybill, a document prepared by the carrier that often contains details of the shipment, route, and charges. Brink's claims that staff accepted the fraudulent document without verifying its authenticity in any way, allowing the suspect to walk out of the warehouse with gold bars, weighing a little over 400 kilograms, and about US2 million in cash. Had AC made the necessary and appropriate inquiries in the circumstances, the unidentified individual's ability to steal the cargo entrusted to its care would have been entirely avoided, read the company's claim. The allegations against Air Canada have not been tested in court and the airline has not yet filed a statement of defence. In an email sent to CP24.com on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Air Canada said they could not provide comment as this matter is now before the courts. According to the court filing, Swiss bank Raiffeisen Schweiz and Valcambi, a precious metals refining company based in Switzerland, hired Brink's to provide security and logistics services to transport the banknotes and gold from Zurich to Toronto. Brink's, the claim states, arranged to ship the items using the AC Secure program, which is said to provide special handling for high-value cargo at a higher cost than regular shipments. The shipments were transported from Zurich to Toronto via flight AC881. Brink's said the flight arrived shortly before 4 p.m. and the cargo was offloaded at approximately 4:20 p.m. before being sent to an Air Canada bonded warehouse at approximately 5:50 p.m. About 40 minutes later, the claim states, the suspect walked into the warehouse and stole the goods. The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) has previously confirmed that the suspect accessed the public side of a warehouse, which the GTAA said is outside of its primary security line. The statement of claim alleges that Air Canada was reckless and failed to enlist reasonable and appropriate security measures and protocols to prevent the cargo from being stolen. Brink's said on April 27, it provided Air Canada with written notice of the loss the company sustained due to the theft and demanded full reimbursement for all losses and damages. Brink's said it has not received a response from the airline. In the statement of claim, the company is seeking reimbursement for the full value of the shipment plus special damages to be determined prior to trial. To date, no arrests have been made in the heist and the valuables have not been recovered. Peel Regional Police have said a theft of this magnitude is rare, although not unprecedented in Toronto. The airport was the setting of a gold heist involving a Brink's armoured car back in 1952, when about 215,000 worth of gold was taken, amounting to roughly 2.35 million today. In that case, the gold was never recovered and the suspects were never caught.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Security company Brink's has launched a lawsuit against Air Canada following the gold heist at Toronto's Pearson International Airport last spring.

Maurice Monk, 45, was the victim of utterly callous and indifferent lack of action by law enforcement and medical staff at Santa Rita Jail, according to the family's lawsuit, amended on Tuesday and citing more than 150 videos taken from Alameda County Sheriff's deputy body cameras. Monk was declared dead on November 15, 2021, and his family's civil action names as defendants Alameda County, which operates the jail, Wellpath Community Care, the private contractors who provide healthcare to prisoners at Santa Rita Jail, and various individual deputies and employees of the facility. Monk's death certificate listed hypertensive cardiovascular disease as the because of his passing, but the man's family disputes that. That is not what killed Maurice Monk. It was the failure of the jail's nurses and guards to ensure Maurice received his medications to treat his mental illness and chronic high blood pressure, family attorney Adant Pointer said in a statement. They literally did nothing more than stare at him and throw food and medications into his cell like he was an animal in a pen at the zoo. Despite the obvious crisis, not a single guard or nurse thought enough about Mr. Monk to call for help. Monk was first booked into jail following an incident on a public bus in Oakland on October 11, 2021, when he suffered a mental health crisis, refused to put on a mask and argued with the driver, his family said. Bail was set at 2,500, but Monk's family members said they could not afford it so he had to sit in custody. Monk was found dead in his cell on November 15, 2021, but it is likely that Mr. Monk was dead well before this, the lawsuit said. Jailers and medical staff visited Monk's cell several times a day on November 12, 13 and 14 and each time he was face down in the bed, naked from the waist down and not responding to any verbal commands, the lawsuit said. Other allegations from the lawsuit include: Deputies did not take decisive action until November 15 when they went into the cell, touched his body and tried to get a pulse -- but by this point Monk was unresponsive and was 'stiff,'  the lawsuit said. Jailers dragged Monk off his bed and performed CPR but he remained unresponsive and was declared dead. Representatives of Santa Rita Jail, Alameda County and Wellpath, based in Nashville, Tennessee, did not immediately return messages seeking their comments on Wednesday.

The airstrikes are in retaliation for the brutal terrorist attacks by Hamas, the militant group that is considered a terrorist organization by several countries. Hamas controls the Palestinian enclave, where 2.2 million people live in about 140 square miles -- making it one of the most densely populated places in the world. Schools have been flattened, walls blown off houses and entire families buried under tons of concrete. Residents are scrambling to rescue relatives from the rubble as smoke and dust from the relentless bombing make it difficult to breathe. It is all collateral damage. We are all civilians, normal doctors, nurses, teachers, students. We are not Hamas, Mohamed Mughisib, a Palestinian doctor and a deputy coordinator with Doctors Without Borders, told NBC News in a telephone interview from Gaza. It is the children who are dying, he said. Hamas, which took control of Gaza after elections in 2006, considers itself a freedom-fighting movement against occupation but is divisive among Palestinians because of its use of violence. Since 2007, Israel has had blockades by land, air and sea in Gaza, also enforced by Egypt, and critics say it has allowed Hamas to fill a power vacuum there. With the Egyptian border also damaged by airstrikes, Nowar Diab, 20, said there is nowhere to flee from the barrage of missiles. My safety is not guaranteed because I am in a house that can be bombed any moment, she said. People think that we can protect ourselves. This is impossible. This is really impossible, we cannot leave and we cannot escape, she said. This is a literal prison. The population in the Gaza Strip is overwhelmingly young, with 7 out of 10 residents under the age of 30. The Israel Defense Forces say 1,200 people have been killed and more than 2,700 injured since Hamas' surprise attack Saturday, the deadliest incursion into Israeli territory in 50 years. The status of scores of people, including children, kidnapped by Hamas in Israel remains unknown. Nearly 1,100 people in Gaza have been killed in Israel's retaliation and 5,000 injured, the health ministries in Gaza and the West Bank said Wednesday. On Monday, a spokesperson for the military wing of Hamas, said it would kill one civilian hostage every time Israel targets civilians in their homes in Gaza without warning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised a devastating response to the attack, saying, What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations. Anticipating a full-scale war, Suhaib Abu Haleina, who lives near the border in the Gazan city of Beit Lahiahad, sought refuge with her family at schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the YOU.N. body charged with supporting Palestinians. The children were terrified and afraid. All night long, they were screaming, 'Daddy, the Jews are bombing us.' They were terrified, terrified, and tired as well, she said. UNRWA said Wednesday that more than 175,000 internally displaced people were sheltering in 88 schools across the Gaza Strip, a number that is expected to increase. Twenty of its schools have been affected by the Israeli airstrikes, the agency said, and nine of its personnel have been killed. While the last few days have seen a big escalation in the conflict, life has been difficult for many in Gaza for years. I carried water in 2008, more than 10 years ago, when my son was not born, and now my son is the one who carries water in 2023, said Haleina, who comes from a family of farmers. Amid heavy bombing in Gaza of what Israel says are military targets, hundreds of residential buildings, mosques and medical facilities have been destroyed. Everyone freezes, starts shaking and tries to find their moms or sisters or brothers to hang on tight, Gaza resident Ahmad Alghari said. Sometimes we jump when we hear the sound of a bomb. Most people are like zombies. The United Nations said Wednesday that more than 260,000 people in Gaza had been displaced, either because their homes had been destroyed or because they had sought shelter in fear for their lives. An intensifying Israeli siege has cut off supplies of water, food and power to the territory, where electricity is available only a few hours a day and only 5 of residents had access to clean drinking water in their homes even before the current war. On Wednesday, Gaza announced its only power plant had stopped working after Israel blocked fuel imports. The pace of attacks is likely to accelerate with Israel's full siege, which could include a ground operation. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said Wednesday that the scenes coming out of Gaza in the coming days will be difficult to understand and cope with. Netanyahu on Saturday warned all civilians in Gaza to get out of there, but that is nearly impossible under the Israeli land, air and sea blockade. Israel, which had controlled Gaza since 1967, defends the blockade as necessary to prevent Hamas attacks on Israelis. It has long been condemned by the YOU.N. and human rights groups, who say it has turned Gaza into an open-air prison, ravaged its economy and only increased local support for Hamas. This most recent violence does not come in a vacuum, YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday. The reality is that it grows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year-long occupation and no political end in sight. Mughisib and others say the retaliation from Israel is the worst they have experienced in decades of conflict. Every 30 minutes you wake up from a severe strike and shaking of the building and shrapnel flying, he said. Afraid that his home, which is near many government offices, would be hit, Mughisib rushed his wife and three children to his office before Israel began retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza on Saturday, hours after Hamas launched its attack. But even at his office, Mughisib said, his family barely escaped a direct hit a few blocks away on Monday night. You see your neighbor has been injured, someone that you know has been killed, he said.

Yep, and it is coming to Tucson The new war-time Cabinet establishes a degree of unity after years of bitterly divisive politics, and as the Israeli military appears increasingly likely to launch a ground offensive into Gaza. The Cabinet, which will focus only on issues of war, will consist of Netanyahu, Benny Gantz -- a senior opposition figure and former defense minister -- and current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a statement released by Gantz said. The government is under intense public pressure to topple Hamas after its militants stormed through a border fence Saturday and massacred hundreds of Israelis in their homes, on the streets and at an outdoor music festival. Militants in Gaza are holding an estimated 150 people taken hostage from Israel -- soldiers, men, women, children and older adults. National Live updates  Day 5 of the latest Israel-Palestinian war By The Associated Press Still, Israel's political divisions remain. The country's chief opposition leader, Yair Lapid, was invited to join to new Cabinet but did not immediately respond to the offer. It appeared that the rest of Netanyahu's existing government partners, a collection of far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties, would remain in place to handle non-war issues. A ground offensive in the tiny, coastal Gaza Strip, densely populated with 2.3 million people, is likely to dramatically hike casualties in a war that has already claimed at least 2,200 lives on both sides. So far, Israel has unleashed an increasingly destructive bombardment in Gaza that has flattened entire city blocks and left unknown numbers of bodies beneath mounds of debris. Militants in Gaza continued to fire rockets at Israel on Wednesday, including a heavy barrage at the southern town of Ashkelon. Some 250,000 people have fled their homes in Gaza -- more than a tenth of the population -- most crowding into YOU.N. schools. Others crowded into a shrinking number of safe neighborhoods in the strip of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, wedged among Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. After the attack by Hamas, Israel halted the entry of food, water, fuel and medicine into the territory. The sole remaining access from Egypt was shut down Tuesday after airstrikes hit near the border crossing. Gaza's only power plant shut down Wednesday afternoon after running out of fuel, the Energy Ministry said. That leaves only private generators to power homes, hospitals and other facilities. With no fuel able to enter, those were on a ticking clock until individual stocks of diesel run out. The Gaza Strip's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, only has enough fuel to keep power on for three days, said Matthias Kannes, a Gaza-based official for Doctors Without Borders. The group said the two hospitals it runs in Gaza were running out of surgical equipment, antibiotics, fuel and other supplies. We consumed three weeks worth of emergency stock in three days, Kannes said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said other hospitals' generators will run out in five days. Residential buildings, unable to store as much diesel, likely will go dark sooner. Egypt and international groups have been calling for humanitarian corridors to get aid into Gaza. Convoys stood loaded with fuel and food Wednesday on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, but were unable to enter Gaza, an Egyptian security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The risk of the war spreading was evident Wednesday after the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position and claimed to have killed and wounded troops. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts  Google Podcasts  Spotify  RSS Feed  Omny Studio The Israeli military confirmed the attack but did not comment on possible casualties. The Israeli army shelled the area in southern Lebanon where the attack was launched. After nightfall, Israel urged residents in the north to shelter after hostile aircraft entered from Lebanon. It did not specify the kind of aircraft. But Hezbollah and Palestinian militants are known to have drones and gliders. YOU.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned other countries and armed groups against entering the war. The YOU.S. is already rushing munitions and military equipment to Israel and has deployed a carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean as deterrence. In the West Bank, Israeli settlers attacked a village south of Nablus, opening fire on Palestinians and killing three, the West Bank-based Palestinian Health Ministry said. It has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the territory and evacuated tens of thousands of Israeli residents from communities nearby. Toppling Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, would likely require prolonged ground fighting and reoccupying Gaza, at least temporarily. Even then, Hamas has a long history of operating as an underground insurgency in areas controlled by Israel. Hamas said it launched its attack because Palestinians' suffering has become intolerable under unending Israeli military occupation and increasing settlements in the West Bank and a 16-year-long blockade in Gaza. But the shock, grief and demands for vengeance against Hamas among Israelis have brought a new ferocity after past conflicts with Hamas that saw heavy bombardments of Gaza but ended with the group still in power. In a new tactic, Israel is warning civilians to evacuate whole Gaza neighborhoods, rather than just individual buildings, then levelling large swaths in waves of airstrikes. Israel's tone has changed as well. In past conflicts, military spokesmen repeatedly insisted on the precision of strikes in Gaza, trying to ward of criticism over civilian deaths. This time, military briefings emphasize the destruction being wreaked. They say targeted neighborhoods broadly are being used by Hamas, but rarely give specifics to justify strikes as they did in earlier wars. We will not allow a reality in which Israeli children are murdered, Defense Minister Gallant said in a meeting with soldiers near the southern border on Tuesday. I have removed every restriction -- we will eliminate anyone who fights us, and use every measure at our disposal. The military tells residents to evacuate neighborhoods about to be struck, and tens of thousands flee. But Palestinians say some are unable to escape or have nowhere to go, and that entire families have been crushed under rubble. Other times, strikes come with no warning at all, survivors say. They directly targeted our house, and there was no warning or anything, said Hashem Abu Manea, 58, who lost his 15-year-old daughter, Joanna, when a strike late Tuesday leveled his home in Gaza City. We were sitting there as civilians, dressed like anyone else. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said Israeli airstrikes destroyed the entire al-Karama neighborhood in Gaza City, with a large number of people killed or wounded. It said medical teams were unable to reach the area because all roads to it were destroyed. Rescue officials say they have struggled to enter other areas as well. At least four Red Crescent paramedics have been killed in strikes, the organization said. Israeli airstrikes late Tuesday struck the family house of Mohammed Deif, the shadowy leader of Hamas' military wing, killing his father, brother and at least two other relatives in the southern town of Khan Younis, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told The Associated Press. Deif has never been seen in public and his whereabouts are unknown. On Wednesday, waves of rockets rained down on the Israeli city of Ashkelon, with shrapnel slamming into the street. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted at least one overhead. Tuesday night, Israeli troops stopped an incursion by militants into Ashkelon, killing three, the military said. The Israeli military said more than 1,200 people, including 155 soldiers, have been killed in Israel, a staggering toll unseen since the 1973 war with Egypt and Syria that lasted weeks. In Gaza, 1,055 people have been killed, according to authorities there. In the West Bank and east Jerusalem, at least 17 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli police during clashes with stonethrowers. Thousands have been wounded on both sides. Israel says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israeli territory and contends that hundreds of the dead inside Gaza are Hamas members.

A fire officer from London who attended the scene said: We cannot get close enough to see. It is too dangerous, it will probably fall down on you, so they will probably bring it all down. The fire took hold of the multi-storey car park, which was opened in 2019, at the busy airport on Tuesday night. It resulted in travel chaos, with the runway closed and flights cancelled most of Wednesday. In total, more than 140 flights were cancelled, with an estimated 40,000 travellers affected. The blaze, which started when a diesel SUV caught fire, caused the car park's floors to collapse, with an estimated 1,200 cars damaged. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service also revealed the car park did not include a sprinkler system. Under building regulations, these types of car parks do not require sprinklers. Chris Bigland, the service's deputy fire chief officer, said: Significant fires of this type have considerable impact on the integrity of the structures they have damaged, and therefore it is essential that expert advice is sought when considering how best to determine the future of the structure. As we now enter the recovery phase, the safest method for removing vehicles will be determined by experts and structural engineers. A spokesman for Luton Airport said that it was working with emergency services to understand the next steps, but could not comment further. On Wednesday, The Telegraph spoke to eyewitnesses who said they heard several explosions before seeing huge flames at the top of the car park. Chris Meacey, 57, a former policeman and soldier, said: I woke up at 2.15am, went down to reception and they informed us of the fire. Mr Meacey, who had parked his van in the car park, added: We made our way up and there we saw flames and we heard several explosions of what sounded like fuel tanks. Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in the airport, with many complaining about a lack of communication from the airlines. The runway was reopened just before 4pm but the airport said that it expected continued delays.

Yuki Iwamura  Bloomberg via Getty Images Caroline Ellison, who led the digital currency hedge fund connected to Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, is continuing her testimony in his criminal trial Wednesday. Ellison, who is also Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend, is considered the star witness in the prosecution's case. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering in connection with his oversight of the now-defunct FTX and Alameda Research, both of which filed for bankruptcy last year. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. His defense attorneys are expected to cross-examine Ellison after she completes her testimony for the prosecution. In less than a year, Bankman-Fried, 31, has gone from a crypto titan and a rising global player with a net worth estimated at 16 billion to a defendant whose closest associates are testifying against him in a case that could put him in prison for decades. Ellison is at the center of that. On Tuesday, she testified that Bankman-Fried told her to steal some 10 billion from FTX's customers and use it to repay firms that had lent money to Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm Ellison was leading. Sam directed me to commit these crimes, Ellison said in court Tuesday after she told prosecutors that she, Bankman-Fried and others had committed fraud. She also said Bankman-Fried set up the system that let her move the money. Ellison started at Alameda as a trader in 2018. She testified that after the hedge fund suffered large losses that year, Bankman-Fried made getting more money a top priority. To that end, he told Alameda employees to get loans on any terms they could. That was risky, because lenders could call those loans in at any time. Ellison said there were enough of them to bankrupt Alameda if the loans all became due and payable immediately. She said Bankman-Fried also tried to strengthen the firms by creating the digital token FTT. She said Alameda owned 60 to 70 of the supply of the coin, which cost essentially nothing to make. When its market price rose from an initial 10 cents to 50 over time, Alameda gained billions on paper. Ellison is testifying under a deal with the government after she pleaded guilty to a series of fraud charges and conspiracy to commit money laundering. FTX cofounder Gary Wang also testified against Bankman-Fried this week after pleading guilty to fraud charges. Both are hoping to get their eventual sentences reduced. Former FTX technology head Nishad Singh also pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the implosion of FTX and Alameda. In 2021, Ellison became Alameda's co-CEO, and later became sole CEO. However, prosecutors say Bankman-Fried was calling the shots. Bankman-Fried's lawyers have argued that Ellison was fully responsible and that she mismanaged the company, including by failing to make protective hedge trades that could have reduced the risk of big losses. Ellison testified that Bankman-Fried told her to put the growing value of the FTT tokens on Alameda's balance sheet so it could borrow money. She said she felt that was misleading, but that he persuaded her to proceed. Alameda later did the same with other coins that gained a great deal of value because of Bankman-Fried's involvement with them. When her testimony continued Wednesday, Ellison told prosecutors about events in June 2022, when several crypto firms and exchanges failed and investors pulled about 1 trillion out of the market. Some of Alameda's lenders were asking for their loans to be repaid, as she feared they would. Ellison testified that she knew the only way to repay them was to take money from FTX customers. She said Bankman-Fried told her to do just that, and that he knew the money was secretly being taken from those customers. When a major lender, the financial services firm Genesis, asked to see an updated Alameda balance sheet, Ellison told the court that she, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh, brainstormed ways to make the company's financial position look stronger so Genesis would not ask for more money back. They prepared a variety of different balance sheets to show Genesis, she said, testifying that she was in a constant state of dread at this time. Bankman-Fried chose a balance sheet that hid the fact that Alameda was taking some 10 billion from FTX's users. By October, she said, Alameda had taken 14 billion to 15 billion from FTX's users, and Bankman-Fried was trying to raise money to fill that hole. She told the court that Bankman-Fried warned her and others to be wary about how they communicate with each other and about putting things in writing. She also testified that Alameda paid a large bribe to Chinese officials to get them to unfreeze about 1 billion in funds on Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges. Bankman-Fried is scheduled to face additional charges, including accusations of bribing foreign officials, in a separate trial in March 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Caroline Ellison is considered the star witness in the prosecution's case.

After Hamas' surprise attack over the weekend, global crude oil jumped to more than 87 a barrel by Monday, from below 83 late last week -- roughly a 5 increase. Prices have since retreated, clocking in at 83.62 Wednesday morning. But Israel and its immediate neighbors are not major energy producers, so as long as the conflict does not expand geographically, seasonal trends should continue much as they have for the last few weeks, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. On balance, we are looking at gasoline prices dropping in all 50 states, he said. A gallon of regular gas cost 3.66 on average in the YOU.S. as of Wednesday, according to AAA, down from 3.83 a month ago. Prices at gas stations are falling as Americans wrap up their summer travel and as refineries switch to their winter fuel blend, which is cheaper and easier to produce. In a note Monday, GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan described the initial spike in crude oil prices as a temporary knee-jerk reaction, adding that he sees a very very low risk of YOU.S. gas prices rising. However, Kloza warned, If you wake up and the theater of war has been expanded to Iran, that changes the calculus. Tehran has long funded the military wing of Hamas, and YOU.S. officials are currently investigating whether Hamas fighters received any advance training from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The winter fuel mix is rolling out at a pace that should allow gas prices to continue falling through the next few weeks, Kloza said, estimating that prices at the pump could drop by as much as 2 cents a gallon each day. That would leave a gallon of regular costing an average 3.25 by Halloween. The conflict has already affected the operations of producers of other types of energy, including natural gas. Israeli officials this week ordered the shutdown of the Tamar offshore gas platform, a major Chevron-operated facility off the coast of Gaza. But analysts so far do not foresee broader disruptions in global supplies, and natural gas prices have been dropping as well. Most YOU.S. households are set to spend less to heat their homes this winter, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday in its latest seasonal forecast, in part because this winter is expected to be warmer than last. The EIA projected the biggest price drops in natural gas costs -- with consumer bills for the fuel set to shrink by 21 on average. Still, crude oil prices on international commodities markets have been volatile lately as traders weighed the violence in the Middle East. That is partly due to potential uncertainty around shipping routes through which oil produced elsewhere in the region gets to markets around the world. A wider conflict including Iran may impact the oil trade through the Strait of Hormuz, a channel Iran has previously threatened to shut, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote on Tuesday. Five of the top 10 largest oil producers -- Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates -- use that waterway, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, to move about a fifth of the world's crude oil supply, according EIA data. But even if Iran were to choke off exports through the strait, the YOU.S. would have the capacity to lean on its own domestic production, analysts said. YOU.S. crude oil exports reached a record high in the first half of 2023, extending America's lead as the largest oil producer in the world, a title it claimed in 2018. Oil hates turmoil, De Haan said in his note, but if the violence does not spill over into other areas, it should not worsen.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Gas prices in the United States are on track to keep falling, energy analysts say.

Other stops include Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Berlin before a stop in Dresden and then Prague. And it will line up for Brits - the Eurostar currently connects London St Pancras to Brussels, which takes around 1hr56. Passengers can then connect to the second train, where they will travel overnight.

This means Brits would be able to travel by train to the Spanish hotspot, with Eurostar services to Amsterdam. European Sleeper previously said in a statement: The Amsterdam-Barcelona night train will strongly improve Europe's quality of north-south rail connections. Even more so because one travels efficiently while asleep on the night train, and distances are reduced to just a night away. The London-Amsterdam route is to be paused however, due to works at the Dutch train station, until June 2024.

READ MORE: Flights diverted to Manchester Airport amid fire chaos at Luton Airport READ MORE: Manchester United fan 'lucky to be alive' in Turkey as gang jump him in brutal attack after spotting tattoo There are numerous reasons why luggage goes missing at airports. As Heathrow is the UK's only hub airport, transfer bags can be missed during connections if a flight is delayed or late arriving at the airport. Issues can also arise from external baggage handling companies, usually appointed by airlines to deal with luggage. The 5 worst airports for lost luggage in the UK are: London Heathrow - 49.68 of mishandled baggage cases London Gatwick - 17.74 of mishandled baggage cases Manchester - 16.13 of mishandled baggage cases London Stansted - 8.87 of mishandled baggage cases Birmingham - 5.24 of mishandled baggage cases A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said: Manchester Airport is the third busiest in the UK behind Heathrow and Gatwick - and every year we look after the bags of almost 30million passengers. We work closely with airlines and their appointed baggage handlers to make sure issues are kept to a minimum and, as this data shows, it is extremely rare that luggage is ever lost. This year we have successfully introduced a new 100-person resilience team, which has made a real difference troubleshooting issues around the airport, ensuring we can react quickly and effectively and avoid disruption to passengers. Where luggage is sometimes held up we work with our partners to make sure passengers are quickly reunited with their bags. Dealing with lost luggage - top tips Cody, CEO and founder of Bounce, has shared his top tips for dealing with lost luggage: 1. Report missing luggage immediately As soon as you realise your luggage is missing, find your airline's representative and file a claim with them before you leave the airport. If you cannot find a representative, source their contact information and give them a call. You will be asked to file a lost baggage report and provide a description of the colour, make and model of your luggage. If you do not hear back from the airline after three days, it is best to update your claim with more specific details about the contents of your bags. 2. Have your luggage delivered After you have reported your luggage lost, most airlines will deliver it to you for free if it is found, although this is not always the case, so make sure to clarify this from the outset. Ask a representative to have your luggage delivered to your accommodation or your home address if this is not possible. Exchange contact details with the airline and ask for a tracking number to check up on the delivery of your bags. 3. Ask for a refund If the airline has lost your luggage, then they may be able to refund your checked baggage fees. Airlines have 21 days to return your lost luggage, although you can make a claim for delayed luggage if they get it to you within this time. If they have not delivered your bags within 21 days, you can claim for lost luggage. 4. Keep your receipts If you are going to be without your luggage for a while, you will need to replace items like clothing, toiletries and other essentials to keep you going until you get it back. If this is the case, keep hold of your receipts so you can be fully reimbursed. To make your claim for lost luggage more likely to be approved, make sure you check what the airline considers reasonable or necessary expenses and only replace what has been lost. 5. Double-check your insurance policy Different insurance policies will have different coverage; be sure to check whether your travel insurance covers lost luggage or not. If not, it may even be worth checking your homeowner's insurance, or the credit card you used to book the flight, as these sometimes have lost luggage benefits too. 6. Check your luggage Hopefully, you will be able to recover your lost luggage and when you do, check it thoroughly for damage and make sure the contents are intact too. If anything is amiss in your luggage, the airline should be able to replace any lost or damaged items. When contacted for comment, Heathrow Airport pointed out that it served 264million passengers from 2018 to 2022. Manchester Airport highlighted that it serves around 100,000 passengers a day in the summer months and around 30million a year.

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will also deliver remarks at the event, slated to begin at 4:15 p.m, according to the White House. In a 10-minute address from the White House on Tuesday, Biden issued a stern condemnation of Hamas' vicious attacks on Israel that he said led to 1,000 Israeli and at least 14 American fatalities. There are moments in this life when pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed on the world, Biden said, with Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken standing behind him as he reiterated his support for Israel. The people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend. As of Wednesday morning, at least 1,200 Israelis -- including more than 150 soldiers -- have been killed and more than 2,700 injured, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. At least 1,087 people in Gaza have been killed and 5,000 injured, according to the health ministries in Gaza and the West Bank. The president, in his remarks on Tuesday, also confirmed for the first time that Americans are among the those being held hostage by Hamas fighters, but he did not specify how many. A White House national security official, however, on Tuesday said 20 Americans are unaccounted for since Hamas' surprise attack on Israel. Biden also said he has directed YOU.S. officials to offer their expertise in assisting Israel's efforts to free the hostages. As president, he added, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world. Biden excoriated Hamas for its abhorrent attacks, which he described as violations of human rights: Infants in their mothers' arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage -- hostages who Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality. He issued those remarks after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone. Family members of Americans believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas have called on the Biden administration to take action to bring them home. As he commits to supporting Israel, Biden is facing competing pressures within his own party, with some progressives having already signaled that they will push for Netanyahu to scale back the lethality of the counterattack if the civilian Palestinian death toll rises. NBC News reported Monday that the Biden administration was sending ships from the Navy's USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and officials plan to keep in place some F-16 and A-10 fighter jets that had been scheduled to rotate out of the region, according to a YOU.S. official. The move is intended to signal a message to stand down, the official said. Israel said Wednesday morning that its fighter jets have struck 450 targets in Gaza in 24 hours. The country's military claimed Tuesday to have regained control inside the country after it launched a full siege of Gaza that cut off food, gas or power from the densely populated area. Blinken is set to travel to Israel on Wednesday.

More than 100 firefighters battled through the night to extinguish the car park inferno, which left tens of thousands of passengers facing cancelled or diverted flights. The fire, which broke out at a terminal car park late on Tuesday, saw 23 incoming flights diverted overnight, with around 30,000 people impacted in total. Inevitably there have been knock-on effects from the closure and many stranded travellers have been left wondering whether they can claim compensation and what airlines are required to do to help them. Others are understandably concerned about the state of their vehicles that were in or near the burning car park. A: Clare, a worrying time for you and all other car owners. Car Park 2 was the one that had the fire, but Car Park 1 is adjacent and its entranceexit is blocked by the damage and recovery work. But from first light this morning, the airport has been working to install a new, temporary ramp to Car Park 1. When I left that area 90 minutes ago they were well advanced and I hope vehicle movements will begin soon. Q: We are flying from Luton tomorrow and have not heard anything about our flight - what do you think we should do? SS7890 A: You are in a relatively strong position. The key airlines at Luton - easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air - are doing all they can to make sure they can operate full schedules to and from the airport from Thursday onwards. Having talked to airport and fire officials, it seems there will now be no safety or logistical reasons why that should not happen - though access will be constrained due to the fire-related work. Anyone, like you, with a confirmed reservation for a Thursday is in a much stronger position than the tens of thousands of people whose Tuesday nightWednesday flights were cancelled. They go to the back of the queue and must try to grab the few available seats on future flights. Q: Why could not they let the people who were already on board aircraft continue to fly away? It would have eased the burden of the displaced passengers on the airport staff and police. Ken Walker A: A really good question, Ken, and one on which I am seeking more information from the airport. My understanding is that the Airport Fire Service was actively involved in the blaze, as you would imagine it would be, and therefore the legal level of firefighter cover that every airport must have was not in operation. Q: Our car has been damaged! Is this a claim on our travel or car insurance? Adam679 A: Really sorry to hear it. You should certainly let your motor insurer know as soon as possible. They may say that you have a claim against the car park operator - or the insurer may pay out and then seek recompense from other insurers. One thing for certain: travel insurance will not be relevant. Q: Does travel insurance cover for these situations. Like costs to get home from airport or diverted airport? Christine A: Travel insurance is very rarely relevant in these circumstances. The airline is responsible for covering costs. Some travel insurance policies may pay a nominal amount for each 12 hours of delay. Q: We are currently at Split airport with our easyJet flight cancelled and booked onto a new flight with a different operator this evening. Whilst we have taken a refund from easyJet, the cost of this evening's flight with another operator is far more costly. Are we able to claim compensation on the price difference - and if so would Luton Airport be liable? BFegan A: My advice is: never take a refund if your flight is cancelled, because the airline may use that as an excuse not to meet its obligation to cover the cost of another flight. But I do not think the airline could reasonably dispute a claim, since clearly you need to get back from Split.Q: Definitely no EU261 compensation for delays and compensation as it is not the airlines fault. Good to see that our railways pay out compensation both for train operator faults (eg train beaks down), Network Rail (eg signal fault) or act of God (eg flood). Is not it time the airline treated it is passengers the same? Phil Richards A: Good points. European air passengers' rights rules are a mess. Post-Brexit the government has had the opportunity to rationalise them, but has chosen not to do so. At present the burden on the airlines is unlimited, while on the railway it is simply a matter of refunding up to 100 of the fare. Q: Were there any policies around parking EVs together at the airport car parks? Alan That is not a question I have asked the airport (or the fire service), but as far as I know there was no such policy. The latest government advice says: The car park owneroperator should carry out a fire risk assessment to determine whether the introduction of EVs or EVCPs electric vehicle charging points into their car park creates new or additional hazards.

Russia launched a series of small-scale offensives in the 85th week of its war with Ukraine, appearing to try and freeze Kyiv's four-month-old counteroffensive by fixing its forces in place. Ukraine's counteroffensive has succeeded in wresting back half the territory Russia captured earlier this year, breaching Russia's vaunted Surovikin line of defence, weakening Russian logistics by striking deep into Crimea, and depriving Russia of control of the western Black Sea. Russia resumed an offensive effort towards the city of Kupiansk at the northeastern end of the front, on October 6, Ukraine's eastern forces spokesman said. Russian sources confirmed the ground assault in the direction of Synkivka following an artillery barrage. Ukrainian officials said in July that Russia had launched a push to capture Kupiansk, and military analysts have assessed that this is a Russian effort to distract Ukrainian forces from parts of the front where they are achieving success. If I was Russia today ... I would do an immediate spoiling attack. I would go on the offensive somewhere, Colonel Seth Krummrich, a vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera in late June. I would punch, because right now you are running out of options ... the Ukrainians are going to find a breach and they are going to punch through it, he said. That is what Russia did in Kupiansk the following month, but it did not stop Ukrainian forces from puncturing their first line of defence on the southern front, near Robotyne, in September. Russian forces near Robotyne appeared to have rotated troops of the 291st and 71st Motorized Rifle Regiments after gruelling September battles in which they retreated before a growing Ukrainian salient through their minefields and trenches. Russian forces near Robotyne and Verbove were busy re-mining front lines previously cleared by Ukrainian forces and slowing them down, said one Russian military blog calling itself Paratrooper's Diary. Although enemy armoured vehicles are increasingly appearing in the Robotyne-Verbove section, the enemy has reduced the movement time due to mined areas, the blogger said. Our sappers manage to re-mine areas already cleared by the enemy. But the blog also corroborated Ukrainian reports that the counteroffensive was continuing. The artillery does not stop for a minute, the blogger said. Russian forces were going on the offensive elsewhere, too. As many as three Russian battalions attacked Ukrainian defences in October near Zherebyanky, west of Robotyne, claiming to have advanced 2km (1.2 miles). They launched a battalion-level offensive near Huliaipole on the southern front, advancing several hundred metres, according to one Russian reporter. And they stepped up efforts to capture Avdiivka, an eastern city they have surrounded to the north and south with a pincer movement. These tactical operations were aimed at freezing what has been a slow but steady Ukrainian advance ahead of Russian presidential elections, said Igor Girkin, a Russian military officer who organised the Russian militia that has fought the Ukrainian army since Donetsk and Luhansk declared they were seceding in 2014. With a 99 percent probability, the Kremlin decided to freeze the war until the elections, that is, until March 2024, wrote Girkin, who goes by the nom de guerre Strelkov, in a letter posted by his wife on social media. In his analysis, Russian President Vladimir Putin will do nothing to seriously aggravate the social, economic and internal political situation in the country, until spring, the sole priority being to prevent deep breakthroughs or sensitive operational successes of the enemy, until then. The Kremlin may expect a lull in winter fighting due to seasonal rainfall that will muddy the ground and make manoeuvres by tanks and armoured fighting vehicles difficult. But Ukraine has said it could maintain the momentum of its summer counteroffensive through the winter. If the cold weather hits immediately ... the ground will remain frozen and heavy machinery will be able to move on it, said Ilya Yevlash, Ukraine's eastern forces spokesman. Despite Russian spoiling attacks, Ukrainian forces pressed on with their counteroffensive. In their southern salient, they marginally advanced south of Robotyne on October 6 and broadened their salient westwards towards the village of Kopani on October 7. They also attempted to expand that salient east, towards Novofedorivka, on October 10. In the east, they continued to advance past the recently recaptured settlements of Klishchiivka and Andriivka south of Bakhmut, in an ongoing effort to surround the captured city and retake it. And on the Donetsk-Zaporizhia border, where the eastern and southern fronts meet, geolocated footage showed that they advanced near the village of Mykilske on October 10. Despite Slovakia's September 30 election of a pro-Russia government, which has announced a halt to weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Slovakia joined fellow NATO members to accelerate training and munitions promised to Ukraine on October 9. NATO ministers voted to further increase their military, intelligence, financial, training and humanitarian support to Ukraine, including long-range missiles and multi-purpose fighter aircraft, and to sustain this support for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Russia launched a series of small-scale offensives in the 85th week of its war with Ukraine.

Wali said this in a statement in reaction to a call by the chairman of Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Sani Musa, for the government to sell the country's ailing oil refineries and invest the proceeds in the mining sector. In August, the minister of state for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Heineken Lokpobiri, said the Port Harcourt Refinery will begin operations by December 2023. The minister stated this during an inspection tour of the rehabilitation work at the Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC) Limited plant. A statement by spokesperson for the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Garba Deen Muhammad, further quoted the minister as saying, Warri will come on stream by the end of the first quarter of next year, and Kaduna will also come on board towards the end of next year. Nigeria currently has four refineries in Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna, which have been shut down for years. However, Wali, who backed the call for the sale of the refineries, said it would be the height of injustice if proceeds from their sale were used to develop any other sector other than Niger Delta region. He advocated that the proceeds of the refineries' sale should be handed over to the NDDC, and in a tripartite arrangement of the NDDC, Federal Government and three reputable construction companies, to fix the East-West Road. He lamented that refineries have remained inoperative and have become a conduit drain pipe for decades despite gulping billions of dollars for turnaround maintenance projects. The UHF statement read: While I welcome the suggestion that the refineries be sold, I will be calling on the people of the Niger Delta to resist any attempt to slap both sides of their cheeks, with the satanic suggestion that any cent, accruing from the sale of this cesspit of corruption thereof, be sent to develop any other sector in another region of the country. The Niger Delta people, must demand that, to the last decimal point, the sale must be used to build the East West road to the standards of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, The Third Mainland Bridge, The Second Niger Bridge, Umaru Yar'Adua Expressway and other roads in Abuja. The East West road has become the biggest symbol of the oppression and suppression of the Niger Delta peoples. The time to resist this class rape and state sponsored infrastructural violence against the people of the Niger Delta, is today. No more tomorrow. I am therefore calling on the government to sell the refineries, remit every cent to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to warehouse and to be dedicated 100, to the construction of the East West road. He said the federal government should ordinarily feel a sense of shame by the deaths arising from the state of the Eleme-Onne, Ahoada-Kaiama and Benin-Warri stretches of the East-West Road, that are incidentally the axis of Nigerian wealth. But this is a state that is deadened by callousness and utter disrespect for the people they exploit their region for the growth of other regions. So, they do not care, but they must be forced to care this time. He said there will be no more tokenism to infrastructural development of the goose that is been laying the golden eggs for over a half of a century. In summary, sell the refinery, hand the proceeds over to the NDDC  in a tripartite arrangement of the NDDC, Federal Government  three reputable construction companies, FIX THE EAST WEST ROAD. Any other arrangement should be resisted and totally rejected by the people of the Niger Delta. Truly, ENOUGH OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH. And if the government goes ahead to do any other thing, with the proceeds of the sale, then the peoples of the region should en masse OCCUPY THE EAST WEST ROAD.

Prosecutors say some of that stolen money ended up in his own bank account.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is confirming that YOU.S. citizens are among the hostages captured by Hamas in this weekend's attack on Israel and he condemned the militant group for sheer evil for its shocking multipronged attack on Israel launched from the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of civilians have been killed, including at least 14 American citizens. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the situation on the ground. Biden outlined the actions he and other allies have taken to support Israel in the aftermath of the attack and expressed his horror about sickening reports of torture inflicted by militants on innocent civilians. The social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, says it is trying to take action on a flood of posts sharing graphic media, violent speech and hateful conduct about the latest war between Israel and Hamas. X says it is treating this crisis with its highest level of response. But outside watchdog groups and a European Union official say misinformation about the war abounds on the platform that billionaire Elon Musk bought last year. Musk himself has recommended unreliable accounts posting about the war. And his job cuts since taking over Twitter last year have left fewer people responsible for taking action on posts that violate the platform's policies.

Vendors in Dominican border cities are allowed to sell basic goods like food and medicine, but exporting electronic products and construction materials, including cement and metal rods, is prohibited. Wednesday marked the first time since Sept. 15 that the border partially reopened, although Dominican President Luis Abinader maintained a ban on issuing visas to Haitian citizens that he implemented last month and will keep the border closed to all migrants, regardless of whether theyre seeking entry for work, tourism, health or education purposes. While the gates at the northern Dominican border city of Dajabon opened late Wednesday morning, the gates on the Haitian side remained closed, and it was not immediately clear why. Meanwhile, dozens of trucks and containers were lined up nearby, filled with goods. The Dominican border reopening was delayed after a pre-dawn fire at the main marketplace in Dajabon destroyed dozens of stalls. Authorities said they were investigating what caused the blaze. The most recent diplomatic crisis stemmed from construction of a canal on the Haitian side that aims to collect water from the Massacre River that runs along the border that both countries share on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The river is named after a bloody 18th-century battle between French and Spanish colonizers. Haitis government has said farmers urgently need the water after an extended drought withered crops in the nearby Maribaroux plain. Meanwhile, Abinader has said construction of a canal violates a 1929 treaty and would divert water needed by Dominican farmers and affect wetlands in the area. Shortly after the spat began, Abinader ordered officials to revive use of a nearby canal to collect water before the river enters Haitian territory. On Monday, Haitis government issued a statement saying the attempt to divert water from the Massacre River to deprive Haitians of it is unacceptable and hostile. The statement stressed the need for dialogue and said the only suitable outcome would be an equal sharing of water resources, the normalization of relations between the two countries and a return to the free movement of people and goods. This project unleashed quite an exceptional movement of national unity that perhaps was not what Abinader expected, said Diego Da Rin, with the International Crisis Group. The canal has become an almost historical point of honor. Haitians want to make it clear that they are a nation that will not allow themselves to be humiliated by their neighbor. Da Rin said Haitians in general appear willing to forego certain goods and needs to support construction of the canal. The diplomatic crisis also appeared to be a boon for Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who is extremely unpopular, Da Rin said. He took advantage of this to raise or improve his image a little at a critical moment, he said. Many Haitians have backed the governments stance, including Marie-Enge Belizaire, 60, who had been buying 20,000 worth of clothes monthly from the Dominican Republic for the past 20 years. She called Abinaders decision to close all land, sea and air borders last month savage, noting that businesses like hers are good for the Dominican Republic. We generate money for them, she said as she sat in a warehouse surrounded by towering columns of boxes filled with clothes. Belizaire said she supports construction of the canal to ease Haitis agricultural crisis and said she is looking into buying clothes from other countries, including Panama. Among those buying at the warehouse where Belizaire works was Orgline Pierre, 40. She said that even if the Dominican Republic opens its borders, she hopes the Haitian side will remain closed. Abinader thinks that Haitian stomachs depend on the Dominican Republic, which is not true, she said. We have food. My son is surviving on local food here and is going to keep surviving. Pierre said she hopes that the upcoming deployment of a multinational armed force led by Kenya to help quell gang violence would also guarantee the safety of Haitians working on the canal along the border. Prior to the diplomatic dispute between both countries, the Abinader administration was pushing to limit the number of Haitians migrating to the Dominican Republic, expelling tens of thousands of them, as well as those of Haitian descent. The administration also has started building a 118-mile (190-kilometer) wall along the border. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have long had a contentious relationship despite strong economic ties. Haiti is the Dominican Republics No. 3 trading partner, with 1 billion in exports to Haiti last year and 11 million in imports, according to the Dominican Republics Export and Investment Center. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republics Central Bank found that 430 million in informal border trade was conducted in 2017 between both countries. Of that amount, more than 330 million represented exports to Haiti. Dnica Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

April 2024 will mark the 20th anniversary of their last -- and only -- victory, when Andy Selva's sixth-minute goal sealed a 1-0 home win in a friendly against Liechtenstein in front of just 200 supporters. While it is a harsh label to apply to a team from a tiny country of 33,000 inhabitants, it is an inescapable fact that San Marino are the worst football team in the world. If you have 11 minutes and 48 seconds to spare, you can watch every goal San Marino have ever scored since their first game in 1990, with all 28 of them neatly packaged together in one YouTube video. Alas, on this September night there is no win, and no more goals, for La Serenissima as Slovenia run out 4-0 winners in front of 844 spectators to extend San Marino's winless run to 132 games. The only excitement comes off the pitch, when supporters watching the game for free in the woodland behind the goal inadvertently set fire to bushes with pyrotechnic flares, causing the final 20 minutes to be played out with thick smoke drifting across the field. If it is a Highway to Hell, San Marino seem to be stuck on a never-ending journey, desperately searching for a way to find that elusive victory to end their nightmare run of failure. But is it really even failure? San Marino, a landlocked, mountainous microstate, is the world's fifth-smallest country. It has no airport, not even a train station, and its football team is a collection of part-time players who get to face some of the game's biggest stars while holding down day jobs: the recent squad included a mechanic, delivery driver and a worker in a jewellery factory. San Marino's coach, Fabrizio Costantini, works in a furniture warehouse. When they fly to Belfast to face Northern Ireland in another qualifier this Saturday, Costantini and his players will be forced to take Friday off work so they can travel. All this losing hurts, but there is also a deep sense of pride within the squad that they are able to represent their country. These are just normal guys living a dream. It is not the same for us because we are not professionals, San Marino captain Matteo Vitaioli, a graphic designer, tells ESPN. I have to work, my teammates have to work, but that is normal for us. The most important thing is to have the heart and passion to succeed and fill the gap. It is difficult, but of course we are proud, even if we are at the bottom of the FIFA ranking. We are here: we are one of the smallest countries in the world, but we play with 100 percent and it is just us, no other nationalities. Even Italy uses players from other countries, but we are just San Marino, so we are very proud of that. As the Slovenia team bus pulls away and heads for nearby Rimini, Italy, where they will fly back to Ljubljana, San Marino's players head to their cars. It is almost midnight on Sunday; many of them are expected at work the following morning. TRISTAN CESELKOVSKI IS 16 YEARS OLD and is sitting on a bench on Via della Fratta with his father, Boris. Tristan is wearing a full San Marino kit. It is matchday in San Marino, but Tristan is the only person wearing the team's colours, making him stand out immediately among the tourists who have come to take in the stunning views of the Adriatic coast from the top of Monte Titano or visit the 14th century Church of San Francesco. But Tristan is no ordinary supporter. He and his father have just arrived in San Marino after a 540-mile drive from their home in Vienna. The journey took 8 hours, and they will be heading back after the game. He is my son and he loves San Marino, so it is what you have to do, Boris tells ESPN with a laugh and shrug of the shoulders. San Marino are my favourite team, Tristan says. I know they do not win, but it is the way the players never give up. They always play with passion and I have always wanted to watch them play. The San Marino team is a strange phenomenon. Walking around San Marino in search of supporters is no easy task because, for locals at least, there is simply no sense of connection to the players who represent their tiny country. You will not find any San Marino fans here, a waiter named Matteo at Birrificio Abusivo, the bar that sells the only beer brewed in the micronation, tells ESPN. You only know that San Marino are playing because the fans of the other team come into town to drink. San Marino -- or the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, to use its full name -- is serene as in sovereign rather than calm and stable, although it is both of those things, too. It was once one of many similar city-states on the Italian peninsula, dating back to its founding in 301 A.D. But while bigger city-states, including Venice and Genoa, were all part of the unification of Italy in 1861, San Marino retained its independence and sovereignty because, as legend has it, the country offered refuge to unification movement leader Giuseppe Garibaldi and his troops during conflict with the Austrian Empire and Papal States. When Garibaldi succeeded in unifying Italy, San Marino was granted its wish of independence in an 1862 treaty and has kept it ever since, even to the extent of remaining neutral during World War II. It also managed to retain its own currency, the Sammarinese lira, until it was replaced by the euro in 2002, and Italian is the only language spoken, which is useful considering San Marino is surrounded by Italy on all sides and neighbours Rimini, the five-star resort on the Adriatic Coast. It is also small, covering just 24 square miles, and has the same population as Helena, the capital of Montana. Imagine Helena having its own team, playing games against the YOU.S. or Mexico, and you get the picture. Finding a San Marino shirt among the shops selling clothes, fragrances and guns -- there are lots of places to purchase firearms in San Marino -- is also a challenge. It turns out just two shops stock the pale blue home shirt. We do not sell many, a shopkeeper at one, Roberto, tells ESPN. It is usually visiting supporters who ask, but I did sell one this morning to the Ukrainian match officials. They came in looking for it specifically. At the other sportswear shop, they even sell San Marino's dark blue away kit. This weekend, the store was busier selling Ducati and Yamaha merchandise to the bikers in town for the San Marino MotoGP, but the owner, Michele, says business is good when big teams play San Marino. I sell lots of shirts to English, Spanish and German fans, she tells ESPN. The San Marino shirt is a novelty. Nobody from San Marino buys them, but it seems as though foreign visitors like it because the team is not so good. There is a souvenir stand at the stadium although there is an element of farce as Martina and Francesco, who work for the San Marino Football Federation, attempt to sell shirts, scarves and pendants to supporters. Their wooden cabin is positioned in a dark corner away from the stadium, facing away from the coach park used by Slovenia fans. There is no electricity in the cabin; everything is in darkness until Francesco uses the spotlight on his phone to highlight the merchandise. I am usually the team liaison officer, Martina tells ESPN. But I help out with the shop at games. It is not so busy tonight, but we had long queues when England played here. San Marino do have a small and loyal fanbase, but the emphasis is on the word small. Inside the stadium, Tristan and Boris have met up with a tiny group of San Marino's most ardent supporters: Josef Junker, Nicolo Vallone and Daniele Dei. Daniele is from Modena, 150 miles away. He watches every home game and does one away trip each year, while Josef has travelled from his home in Bavaria to watch every home game for the past 10 years. My first game was 20 years ago, Josef tells ESPN. I am German, but I am not a fan of the Germany team. They are too arrogant. I come to watch San Marino because of the honesty and the amateur element of it. It is real football. Why do I come? To see San Marino draw and score: those moments are special. And hopefully, someday soon, a win. It perhaps sums up the nation's hard-luck story that super-fan Josef was not among the 200 who saw them beat Liechtenstein in 2004. SAN MARINO PLAYED THEIR LAST HOME GAME, against Kazakhstan in June, 200 miles away in Parma, Italy, to upgrade the playing surface at San Marino Stadium so it met UEFA standards. It is too good now, one of the San Marino officials tells ESPN. It makes it even harder for the players to compete against the top teams. The suited official then points to an overgrown field next to the stadium car park and jokes, We prefer it to be like that. The problem for San Marino is that it is not only the top teams against whom they struggle. Since the start of last year, they have also lost to Cape Verde, Malta (twice) and St. Lucia. Yet despite the recurring nightmare of playing and losing (sometimes heavily), there is an absence of cynicism or weariness among the players when asked whether they grow tired of experiencing defeat virtually every game. Perhaps it is down to their everyday reality of their lives: they are working men who get to live the dream of playing football against some of the world's best players before going back to reality the following day. There are no hard-bitten, professional egos among them. They are simply enthusiastic amateurs who want to do their best, no matter the opposition. Defender Roberto di Maio, who at the age of 40 in March became the oldest footballer in Europe to make his international debut, admits every game is a test of physical and mental capabilities. Of course, it is complicated because we are facing such skillful nations, Di Maio, who works for the federation, tells ESPN. We are 90 minutes-plus under pressure every time, so it is difficult. We have to stay focused all the time. Sometimes it is good when we are facing not-so-good teams. Others, like for example Denmark, whom we faced in September, they are very tough to play. You have to stay focused all the time. No mistakes. As San Marino's goalkeeper, Elia Benedettini, who works for his parents' transport company, has one of the toughest jobs in sport. He concedes goals in most games -- he has managed two shutouts, against the Seychelles and Gibraltar, in 45 games -- and it took Slovenia just four minutes to open the scoring in this match. But the 28-year-old, who has played as high as Serie B in Italy, does not regard his role as a thankless task. I know it is difficult, he says. But it is always a good feeling to play in a San Marino shirt, no matter the results. It is a dream to play in these matches, even though it is tough. I think it is a beautiful experience and all of our opponents, even the big stars, treat us with respect. Playing against San Marino is not easy either, despite the reality that it usually results in three points for the opposition. Germany inflicted San Marino's heaviest defeat with a 13-0 win in September 2006, while England recorded a 10-0 victory in November 2021. Yet San Marino famously scored the then-fastest-ever international goal when Davide Gualtieri put the team ahead after just seven seconds against England in November 1993. That game still ended in a 7-1 defeat. Former Manchester City and England defender Joleon Lescott, who played in an 8-0 win in San Marino in March 2013, told ESPN that games against them come with unique challenges. When you play against San Marino, you just have to get to 2-0 as quickly as possible, he says. The last thing you want is to be in a situation where they could score and make things difficult for you. If you concede against them, or fail to win, it is a historical moment and the kind of history that you will never be allowed to forget. You have to treat the game with absolute focus and just score as early as you can. When told of Lescott's admission that even England players worry about facing San Marino, defender Simone Franciosi, a student by day, smiles. If great players from England are maybe, I would say, a little bit stressed about facing San Marino, it is good news, he says. It is great news. Thank you! Our objective is always the same: keep it 0-0 for as long as possible to feed the pressure, but sure, it is not easy. We do not play to lose; we always want to win, but I have just started my international career and I know it will be tough to win these games. Regardless of the likely outcome of every game they play, none of the San Marino players suggests that representing their country is a burden and Di Maio is perhaps the best example of the joy that it brings. Born in Naples, he is the only non-Sammarinese in Costantini's squad, having waited 13 years for his San Marino nationality. He is now making up for lost time. There are some special laws in San Marino, he says. I waited 13 years and married a San Marino girl, so I have my nationality now. It is a very long time, but I succeeded. As long as I have fun, I want to play again. Again, again. If the mind is good, the body will follow the mind, so of course I can go on. It is fun for me, even to have four goals to zero. But the most important thing for us is to compete and we do that. There are so many players here who, tomorrow, will go to work, but they have a job and we have to applaud these guys because they are perfect. Battistini's colleagues -- he is a mechanic by trade -- also acknowledged that sense of awe at being able to keep up. He is never here at work, always playing, but we need him here too because he is so good! Vitaioli wears the captain's armband against Slovenia and is back in his studio as a designer by 9 of the clock the following morning. That is the reality for this group of players. It is normal for us, he says. We all play for semi-professional clubs in San Marino, some of us in Italy, but when we work, we are just normal guys in the office or the factory. His workmates are still impressed -- He knows how to do everything -- both to play soccer and being a great designer -- but Vitaioli has a more grounded perspective. Nobody sees us as stars, he says with a smile. SAN MARINO ARE READY TO WIN. Twenty years without a victory is an unwanted milestone that is fast approaching, but the team is improving -- Costantini's side has conceded just 21 goals in six Euro 2024 qualifiers -- and they can see light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. When the UEFA Nations League resumes in 2024, San Marino will be in League D alongside fellow minnows Andorra, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, the only team they have ever beaten. The losses in their Euro 2024 group have been expected, but by making themselves more organised defensively, there is a genuine hope that the tactical work will pay off when playing against teams of a similar standard. The Nations League is a big chance for us, San Marino Football Federation president Marco Tura tells ESPN. That is the opportunity for us to draw or even win. This is our competition, so it is like tailor-made for us. We want to practice good and perform good and if the feeling is good for the players on the pitch, maybe it would be a dream for us to succeed, to draw or win, which is our goal. Costantini, who has been in charge since November 2021, agrees that the Nations League offers San Marino their best chance to win for 20 years. We should focus on preparing for the best of our opportunities with the Nations League next year, he says. Because in that tournament we will have the opportunity to share the pitch with the teams that are not better than us in terms of physical approach, athletic skills and technical ones. They are closer to our level and we will have the opportunity to get the result. Selva remains the only player to have scored a winning goal for San Marino. He is the country's all-time top scorer with eight international goals during an 18-year career and speaking to The Times (UK) in 2021, he recalled the feeling of beating Liechtenstein in 2004. The emotion was indescribable, Selva says. We felt something different on the pitch during that game. We were very focused, there was an electricity in the air. We felt that sooner or later the result would come, and that maybe that was the right time. For a team used to always losing, getting a win, even in a friendly, is something so beautiful. Those moments will remain in history for every player. Lorenzo Lazzari, San Marino's centre-forward and a full-time student, dreams of emulating Selva and scoring his country's first winning goal for two decades. The 20-year-old was born two months after that solitary victory, but he already holds the distinction of being the last player to score for San Marino, seven games ago, in a 1-1 draw against St. Lucia in November 2022. Lazzari made his San Marino debut as a second-half substitute in that game and he became an instant hero by equalising in the fourth minute of stoppage time. It was a big emotion for me, Lazzari tells ESPN. It was even unbelievable. I did not expect it, so it was special for me. Of course it is difficult to play as a striker for San Marino, but it is a dream to score and it will be a dream even bigger than the one in St. Lucia if I can score a winning goal. AS THE SAN MARINO PLAYERS WALK OFF THE PITCH at the end of their latest defeat, this time against Slovenia, the bond between themselves and their small band of supporters is evident. Members of the team seek out young fans in the crowd to whom they can pass on their kit -- even down to the shorts and socks. The players are determined to win; the fans are equally desperate to witness it. It is amazing for us to have supporters all around the world, goalkeeper Benedettini says. Even on social media, we get some messages from Argentina, Brazil, which is, for us, something crazy. But there are the fans who are here too. There are not so many, but we appreciate them and for those guys that are supporting us all the time, maybe next year we will do something special and dedicate it to them. Sooner or later, San Marino will be ready to celebrate. They might even get the locals along to the party, too.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Slovenia beat San Marino 4-0 in a Euro 2024 qualifier in San Marino.

Twenty-nine people were killed and dozens wounded in a strike late Monday night on the camp in Kachin state near the border with China, sparking a desperate rush to pull bodies from the debris by torchlight. The camp is one of many in Myanmar's northern hills, home to the world's largest jade mines and a decades-long conflict between the military and ethnic Kachin rebels that has escalated since the junta seized power in a 2021 coup. The explosion was felt in the town of Laiza, around two kilometres (1.2 miles) away, an activist based there told AFP. Even my house was shaking when the bomb hit the camp, she said, asking not to use her name due to security concerns. Mong Lai Hkyet camp -- home to around 600 people -- was largely deserted on Wednesday, with soldiers from the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), which controls the area, restricting access to the scene. Structures of wood, corrugated metal and bamboo lay crumpled and twisted, and a wooden sign pointing the way to a local school lay lopsided in the earth. Residents working in small groups picked through the debris to salvage belongings. The explosion was felt in the town of Laiza, around two kilometres (1.2 miles) away, an activist based there told AFP The blast shattered windows in the hospital at Laiza, where some of the 56 wounded in the attack were treated, the activist said. The dead were buried on Tuesday afternoon; a crowd sang Christian hymns as wooden coffins were lowered into the ground. Some family members wept and laid wreaths of flowers before an excavator pushed earth over the resting places. The KIA controls swathes of Christian-majority Kachin state and has clashed with the military for decades. The region has seen heavy fighting in the wake of the coup, with the military accusing the KIA of arming and training the newer People's Defence Forces that have sprung up to battle the junta. - 'Need to resettle' - A KIA investigation had determined the military had used a drone carrying a huge bomb in the attack, KIA spokesman Colonel Naw Bu told AFP. The military has denied it was involved. On Wednesday it said the blast was a result of an explosion at a KIA warehouse containing around 105 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and weapons. The dead were buried on Tuesday afternoon; a crowd sang Christian hymns as wooden coffins were lowered into the ground The military added that it was still investigating what had set off the blast. Laiza, nestled against the Chinese border, is the headquarters of the KIA, where it has trained and equipped other ethnic rebel groups battling the military in their homelands. Military air strikes on a concert held by the KIA's political wing in October last year killed around 50 people and wounded 70. The junta said reports that the air strike killed civilians were rumours. Our people have lost their lives, their properties and their lives have been threatened, said the activist from Laiza. We urgently need to resettle people and find new livelihoods for the wounded, and it will be very hard to do this.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a strike late Monday night on the camp in Kachin state near the border with China.

Amazon workers have been taking strike action since February calling for a pay increase to 15 an hour to cope with the cost-of-living crisis and for union recognition to address working conditions. However the delivery giant has refused to recognise the GMB union, and announced on Monday that they would be imposing a pay rise from 11 an hour to 11.80, and then again to 12.30 in April for warehouse workers. GMB organiser Stuart Richards told LFF that the workers response was of, absolutely huge anger and frustration at feeling their demands were being ignored, as workers called for the latest strike dates to be announced in reaction to the pay rise. Amazon is playing this in the press as another great pay award, said Richards. The reality is for these workers, that their pay has fallen so much closer to the minimum wage over that period of time that they are just increasingly frustrated that they have a company that is refusing to listen to them. So this is their response, added Richards in reference to the latest strike dates set to hit Amazon in the run up to and on one of the most popular shopping days. Releasing those dates early was their response to Amazon saying, No, this is not acceptable, you are not listening to us, we are going to keep on. Richards said he had not seen a single comment from workers suggesting the latest pay rise was acceptable, which was 'wild' given the number of workers involved and struggling with a cost-of-living crisis. All I have seen is anger from people saying 'no, we have been doing this, we have been fighting this for coming up to a year now, and you are just refusing to listen to us'. So from their perspective, it really does look like they are on board and saying it is 15 we want. According to Amazon UK, their minimum starting salary has risen by 20 in two years and 50 since 2018. John Boumphrey, Amazon UK Country Manager said: Amazon have some of the most talented colleagues around, and we are proud to offer them competitive wages and benefits, as well as fantastic opportunities for career development, all in a safe and modern work environment. But Richards said Amazon are continued to refuse to communicate with GMB over pay and conditions, whilsts the union now have over 1,000 members signed up at the Coventry site. GMB have approached the company for the second time asking for voluntary union recognition in Coventry however have apparently received the same response of refusal. Amazon are just unwilling to ask their workers or let their workers go through a process where they can secure (union recognition), instead spend a huge amount of money to subvert the process. This is effectively a statement from our members at Coventry saying we are not going to live with this. Another Amazon warehouse site in Rugeley had also voted to take industrial action in July, however since then it has been announced that the site is closing. But Stuart Richards said the overriding feeling of anger over pay and conditions was driving many workers to join a union. We have got to give them the confidence of going now to their colleagues and saying actually if we want to do this, we have to do this together and build some collective strength on that. That is a real big journey for these workers. We have done it in Coventry, we are confident we can do it in other places, but it is going to take a long time. It was also revealed that union representatives will be meeting with colleagues from different unions across the globe in Manchester at the end of this month to coordinate action going forward. More than 1,000 workers are set to walk out on 7, 8, 9 November and the 24, Black Friday, bringing the total days lost to industrial action up to nearly 30. GMB organiser Rachel Fagan warned the upcoming strikes will 'ripple throughout the company's UK logistics'. Fagan said: As Black Friday looms, Amazon must urgently reconsider their priorities or risk strike action causing widespread disruption to customers and the public.

House Republicans vote via secret ballot for new speaker at 10:00 am ET... Donald Trump stumps in Florida... Filing for New Hampshire presidential primary begins with Asa Hutchinson submitting his paperwork... And federal prosecutors hit Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., with 23 additional charges. But FIRST... On Monday, we wrote that the Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East had the potential to recast the 2024 presidential race -- at least in the short run. And 48 hours later, here are four different ways the war has already reshaped the contest. One, it is allowed President Biden to seize a commander-in-chief moment. In this moment, we must be crystal clear, the president said Tuesday afternoon. We stand with Israel. We stand with Israel. He added, There is no justification for terrorism. There is no excuse. Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. And, Biden warned against other nations thinking of taking advantage of the situation. I have one word: Do not, he said. Two, it gave entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy an opening to go after YOU.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who has been moving up in the GOP polls. I am disappointed and deeply concerned by the remarks of certain presidential candidates including Nikki Haley who have irresponsibly called the Hamas attack an 'attack on America' and rabidly shout 'FINISH THEM!!' repeatedly without offering a pragmatic path forward, he said yesterday. Ramaswamy added, The YOU.S. should provide Israel with diplomatic support, intelligence-sharing, and necessary munitions to defend its own homeland, while taking special care to avoid a broader regional war in the Middle East. Three, the war gave Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., a platform during his foreign-policy speech in D.C. on Tuesday to blast his GOP rivals (like Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis), as well as President Biden, per NBC's Nnamdi Egwuonwu. And four, it is given Donald Trump another opportunity to make the argument he regularly makes in these kinds of moments: This would have never happened on my watch. Can you imagine what this guy Biden has done to us, what he is done to us? That would have never happened? Trump said Monday in New Hampshire. The attack on Israel would never, ever have happened. The attack on Ukraine would never have happened. Inflation would never have happened. None of it would have happened. That is how many Americans have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday. The number has risen since Monday, when YOU.S. officials said that 11 Americans had died. Biden added that American citizens are among those being held hostage by Hamas, though he did not specify how many. He doubled down on his support for Israel, adding, Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is sharpening his case against Trump, telling MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday that Democrats have a better chance at winning the White House in 2024 if Trump is the GOP nominee. I think a referendum on Joe Biden means we win, if I am the candidate. I think a referendum on Donald Trump, if that is it, then I think the Democrats would win, DeSantis said. DeSantis added there are millions of voters who disapprove of Biden and believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. They want to vote for a Republican, he said, But once it is Donald Trump, that is just a dealbreaker for them. They just will not do it. DeSantis also discussed the war in Israel, saying the country has a right to defend itself and that Hamas needs to be no more. Asked if he would support the Israeli military conducting strikes against Iranian targets, DeSantis said, I think that Israel should be focused on uprooting Hamas. To make this a larger role, I think does have some risks. But I would say the United States should turn every screw so that Iran is not getting money flowing into its coffers, particularly with their oil. DeSantis was also asked if he is concerned that Trump allegedly discussed a classified planning document related to Iran at his New Jersey golf club. He said it would be a different thing if that allegation were true, adding the former president is innocent until proven guilty. In other campaign news ... The age old question: NBC News' Chuck Todd examines just how much concerns about Biden's age could affect his re-election campaign. Conspiracy on the campaign trail: Trump appears to have embraced an internet conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is secretly running the White House, NBC News' Alex Tabet, Jake Traylor and Brandy Zadrozny report.

Finland and other Baltic countries are on high alert as a natural gas undersea pipeline leak was detected on Sunday from Finland to Estonia. EU officials already suspect the leak was caused by a 'deliberate act of destruction,' which fuels concerns about 'Nordstream 2.0' and Europe's energy security ahead of the Northern Hemisphere winter. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg met with EU officials about the damage sustained on the 77-kilometer (48-mile) Balticconnector pipeline, first detected by one of the two pipeline operators, Finland's Gasgrid, on Sunday morning.

He said, The important thing now is to establish what happened and how this could happen ... and if it is proven to be a deliberate attack on NATO critical infrastructure, then this will be serious but will also be met by a united and determined response from NATO. On Tuesday, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said the leak was triggered by an external source but failed to speculate on who caused it. Earlier today, Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Putin, said the damaged pipeline is very alarming news. According to the state media Tass News, Peskov said the Kremlin awaits further details. He added explosions that damaged the nearby Nord Stream pipeline one year ago have set dangerous precedents across the Baltic Sea.

Bloomberg quoted seismologist Jari Kortstrom at the University of Helsinki, who said Finland detected a small seismic event around the time the pipeline sustained damage.

Finland said it had raised its preparedness level on October 11 after damage was discovered to the Balticconnector pipeline over the weekend as an investigation into the incident continues amid suspicions it was caused by outside interference. We know that the because is not nature, but probably human activity. Who, why and how? Negligence or intent? These questions have yet to be answered, Karis wrote in a post on Facebook. The incident occurred a little over a year after the larger Nord Stream gas pipelines, a major conduit for Russian natural gas exports to Western Europe, were damaged by explosions. Denmark, Sweden, and Germany opened probes into the incident, which was deemed to be sabotage. The case remains unsolved. Reuters quoted Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur as saying it can clearly be seen that the subsea gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia was damaged by external activity. It can clearly be seen that these damages are caused by quite heavy force, Pevkur told Reuters, adding that investigators were not ruling out anything at this stage. So what it is exactly, we have to specify yet, but at the moment it rather seems that it had been mechanical impact or mechanical destruction. The incident was first noticed on October 8 when Finnish and Estonian gas system operators noticed an unusual drop in pressure in the Balticconnector pipeline, after which they shut down the gas flow. Finnish authorities said on October 10 that they had identified the location of the outage in the 77-kilometer pipeline, but the because of the damage was not yet clear and the investigation was continuing. Estonian Navy Commander Juri Saska said the pipeline, which was encrusted in concrete for protection, looks like someone tore it on the side. The concrete has broken, or peeled off, specifically at that point of injury, Saska told Estonian public broadcaster ERR. Afterward, the Norwegian seismological institute (NORSAR) said it detected a probable explosion on October 8 in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Estonia, both NATO member states, where the gas pipeline leak was later detected. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that if the damage was proven to be due to an attack, it would be met by a united and determined response. If it is proven to be an attack on NATO critical infrastructure...it will be met by a united and determined response from NATO, he said on October 11 before a meeting of alliance defense ministers in Brussels. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described news of damage to the Balticconnector as disturbing and said Russia was awaiting further information on the incident. The Balticconnector pipeline runs across the Gulf of Finland from the Finnish town of Inkoo to the Estonian port of Paldiski. It is bi-directional, transferring natural gas between Finland and Estonia depending on demand and supply. Commissioned in 2019, the Balticconnector has been the only gas import channel to Finland apart from liquefied natural gas (LNG) since Russian imports were halted in May 2022 following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia stopped supplying gas after Finland refused to pay in rubles, a condition imposed on unfriendly countries -- including European Union member states -- as a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions against Russia's central bank. Most of the gas that was flowing in the Balticconnector pipeline before it was closed on October 8 was going from Finland to Estonia from which it was forwarded to Latvia, Estonia's gas system operator Elering said. Estonian consumers have been receiving gas from Latvia since the shutdown of the pipeline, Elering said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Estonia's President Alar Karis says Estonia is demanding answers for damage to a Baltic Sea gas pipeline.

Yesterday's announcement from Brussels not to extend the European Union's legal framework which exempts liner shipping consortia from EU antitrust rules has sent shockwaves throughout global supply chains. The commission said on Tuesday that the Consortia Block Exemption Regulation (CBER) no longer promotes competition in the shipping sector and therefore it will let it expire on April 25, 2024. Given the small number and profile of consortia falling within the scope of the CBER, the CBER brings limited compliance cost savings to carriers and plays a secondary role in carriers' decision to cooperate. Furthermore, over the evaluation period, the CBER was no longer enabling smaller carriers to cooperate with each other and offer alternative services in competition with larger carriers, the European Commission explained. According to the commission's statement, the expiry of the CBER does not mean that cooperation between shipping lines becomes unlawful under EU antitrust rules, instead, carriers operating to or from the EU will assess the compatibility of their cooperation agreements with EU antitrust rules based on the guidance provided by the Horizontal Block Exemption Regulation and Specialisation Block Exemption Regulation. The World Shipping Council, a liner lobbying group, said that it disagreed with the logic behind the decision to discontinue the CBER but that it appreciated the recognition of the many benefits of vessel sharing to European industry and consumers. The shift to general EU antitrust rules will create a period of uncertainty as carriers adjust to the new legal structure. Nevertheless, vessel sharing agreements will remain a fully legal and supported way for carriers to ensure efficient and sustainable transport for Europe, said John Butler, president and CEO of the World Shipping Council. Despite the attention given to the exemption, its abolition is expected to have little impact on the industry given the modest number of consortia still in operation, analysts at Alphaliner stated in a weekly report. The Southern Africa Europe Container Service (SAECS) was one of a handful of groups that benefited from CBER. CBER's abolition might have been politically necessary, however, given its opposition by many forwarders and port operators, who are increasingly competing with the large, integrated carriers, Alphaliner suggested. Nicolette van der Jagt, director general of the European Association for Forwarding, Transport, Logistics and Customs Services (CLECAT), welcomed the decision, saying: We are pleased that the commission has listened to the voice of the customers, freight forwarders and their shipper clients. For many years, we have told the European Commission that the regulation is no longer fit for purpose. Meanwhile, CLECAT's UK peer, the British International Freight Association (BIFA), has urged the UK government to follow suit. Steve Parker BIFA's director general, said his organisation hoped the UK would follow the EC's lead and not retain the equivalent of a block exemption regime for the liner shipping industry in the UK, when the current one expires in April 2024. The EC has taken a sensible decision and the UK government should follow suit to ensure that shipping lines in future will be subject to competition law, Parker said. However, analysis by UK shipping consultancy Drewry argues that the EC's decision could ultimately backfire on shippers. Drewry maintains there was no compelling case that carriers abused market power during the pandemic. Such was the extraordinary impact of covid on supply chains that freight rates would have soared with or without the CBER, it suggests. Secondly, the hoped-for increase in competition will be stymied by legal uncertainty and extra bureaucracy, Drewry reckons. By effectively coercing lines to operate independently, the logical conclusion is that each carrier will have to downsize their service portfolios in terms of frequency and connectivity. That would reduce, not increase, competition on a port-pair basis and push up freight rates, wrote Simon Heaney, a senior liner analyst with Drewry, in an update on LinkedIn. Jonathan Roach, a container analyst at Braemar, concurred in a note to clients, noting that the EC decision may not have a massive impact on very large carriers that can go it alone without too much disruption. If carriers are forced in the future to operate standalone services, each carrier will have to choose and operate individual services (port-pairs) on their east-west trade offerings. Most carriers will offer less flexibility in their port pairs compared to today, Roach stated.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The European Commission said on Tuesday that the Consortia Block Exemption Regulation (CBER) no longer promotes competition in the shipping sector.

Human-induced climate change made the recent winter heatwave in South America 100 times more likely, according to a study published on Tuesday. Global warming was the main driver of the extreme weather that scorched much of the continent for most of August and September. Temperatures rose by as much as 4.3 degrees Celsius. Across large parts of Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina, temperatures soared above 40C in late winter and lingering into the Southern Hemisphere's spring. At least four heat-related deaths were reported in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, but the true death toll is likely to take months to determine by analysing death certificates, the study by the scientific group World Weather Attribution said. Heat kills, particularly in spring, before people are acclimatised to it. Temperatures above 40C in early spring are incredibly extreme, said Julie Arrighi, a co-author of the study and director at the nonprofit Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. A dozen researchers from universities and meteorological agencies around the world produced the study. This year is on track to be the world's hottest ever recorded, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said last week. Summer heatwaves recorded in the Northern Hemisphere - including the United States, Europe and China - will be major contributors to that record. But it is more striking that South America hit such extreme temperatures in the winter, said Gareth Redmond-King, a climate expert at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit in London. Redmond-King was not involved in the study. The onset of the climate phenomenon El Nino this year also helped push temperatures higher, but was a minor factor compared to climate change, the study said. The study warned that if global warming reaches 2C hotter than the pre-industrial average, similar heatwaves in the region are predicted to happen every five or six years. The United Nations warned last month that the countries were not doing enough to tackle climate change and current national climate targets have the world on track to warm by 2.5C. In the Brazilian Amazon, the heatwave has been accompanied by severe drought that has killed fish, made water undrinkable and prompted Indigenous inhabitants to ask the government to declare a climate emergency.

The latest magnitude 6.3 earthquake was about 17 miles outside Herat, the capital of Herat province, and 6 miles deep, according to the YOU.S. Geological Survey. Wednesday's quake has injured at least 80 people and a landslide has blocked the main Herat-Torghondi highway, Information Ministry spokesman Abdul Wahid Rayan said. It also flattened all 700 homes in Chahak village, which was untouched by the tremors of previous days. There are mounds of soil where dwellings used to be. But there were no deaths initially reported in Chahak because people have taken shelter in tents this week, fearing for their lives as tremors continue to rock Herat. Villagers are distraught over the loss of their homes and livestock, often their only possessions, and worry about the coming harsh winter months. Some said they had never seen an earthquake before and wondered when the shaking of the ground would stop. Many said they have no peace of mind inside the tents for fear the ground will open and swallow us at any moment. The epicenter of Saturday's quake was about 25 miles northwest of the provincial capital, and several aftershocks have been strong, including another of magnitude 6.3 on Saturday. Taliban officials said more than 2,000 had died across Herat after the earlier quakes. They subsequently said the quakes killed and injured thousands but did not give a breakdown of casualties. Besides rubble and funerals after Saturday's devastation, there is little left of the villages in the region's dusty hills.

Atlanta police have fired an officer who in August used a stun gun on a 62-year-old church deacon, who later died, authorities announced Tuesday. Officer Kiran Kimbrough did not follow the department's standard operating procedures during the August 10 arrest of Johnny Hollman, who failed to sign a citation following an accident, according to a Tuesday statement from Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum. Kimbrough went ahead with the physical arrest without having a supervisor on scene, he said. I understand the difficult and dangerous job that our officers do each and every day throughout the city. I do not arrive at these decisions lightly, Schierbaum said. Only after a diligent review of all the facts, while ensuring the due process of our officers, do I arrive at my decision. Kimbrough's attorney said in a statement the former officer vehemently denies any wrongdoing or policy violations and said his client's actions did not because Hollman's death. He will appeal his termination reportedly predicated upon his failure to call for a supervisor when Mr. Hollman refused to sign a lawfully issued citation as he was legally obligated to do, attorney Lance J. LoRusso said. Relatives said Hollman, a church deacon, was driving home from Bible study at his daughter's house and bringing dinner to his wife when he collided with another vehicle while turning across a busy street west of downtown Atlanta. According to a previous police statement about the August 10 incident, an officer was dispatched to the accident and determined the driver who was at fault. The officer tried to issue a traffic citation, but the driver was agitated and uncooperative and resisted when the officer tried to arrest the driver, police said. After several minutes struggling with the driver, the officer utilized his taser and, with the help of a witness, placed him into handcuffs. Once the driver was in handcuffs, the officer realized he was unresponsive and requested EMS to the scene, police said. The driver was taken to Grady Hospital and has been pronounced deceased. An autopsy determined Hollman's manner of death was a homicide. The medical examiner found heart disease contributed to his death. Kimbrough was hired as an Atlanta police cadet in March 2021 and became a police officer that October, according to Georgia Peace Officer Standards  Training Council records. Those records show he had no disciplinary history. Since Hollman's death, police have changed policy to let officers write refusal to sign on a traffic ticket instead of arresting someone who will not sign. The policy requires officers to inform drivers that a signature is not an admission of guilt. It just acknowledges receipt of the ticket and court date, police said. Mawuli Davis, a lawyer for the Hollman family, said Monday that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis told him and relatives during a meeting that the video would be publicly released as soon as Willis concludes that all witnesses have been interviewed. That could be as soon as Thursday. Police said Tuesday that body camera footage of the incident is part of a pending homicide investigation and will not be released until the completion of that investigation as well as a pending administrative investigation. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has an ongoing investigation as does the county's district attorney's office, police said. According to a police incident report, Hollman's 2021 Chevrolet Silverado was impounded and an officer found a Glock 22 40 mm gun in the console, and found under a back seat was bookbag that had two clear jars of nine baggies of marijuana, and 28.2 grams of an unknown substance, the report said. On August 17, Hollman's grandson told police the gun in the center console was his and he was able to provide documents proving as much, police said. Hollman family lawyer Davis said discussion of the marijuana is a red herring to smear Hollman after the fact, and that there is no evidence Kimbrough knew about the drugs. None of that had anything to do with this officer's behavior, Davis said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Officer Kiran Kimbrough failed to have a supervisor on scene before the physical arrest, police say.

The workers, who earn little more than the minimum wage, were sent back on the job on the basis of a sell-out union-management deal that will further cut real wages. Workers at Ingham's, Australia's largest poultry and feed processing company, voted overwhelmingly to strike in opposition to the company's offer of nominal wage increases of 3.9 percent in the first year, followed by 3.5 percent in each of the two following years. The company also rejected a demand for casual workers to be offered permanent employment after six months. Ingham's has operations in every state and in the Northern Territory. The company last month reported that revenue for fiscal 2023 rose 12.2 percent to 3.04 billion and net profit increased 72 percent to 60.4 million. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Reeves is on a base salary of 1.2 million, having received a 9 percent pay rise this year. The proposed deal, hailed as a win by the United Workers Union (UWU) bureaucracy, is scarcely better than the original offer: a 13.12 percent pay rise over three years, comprising 5.12 percent this year and 4 percent increases in 2024 and 2025. This is not a victory for Ingham's workers, but a betrayal by the UWU leadership, all the more stark for its swift execution. When workers at the Bolivar, SA and Osborne Park, WA plants walked off the job on Friday September 22, they were committed and resolute in their opposition to Ingham's meagre proposal. The union claimed to be putting forward a demand for an 18 percent pay rise over three years, yet by the morning of Wednesday September 27, the bureaucracy was pushing through a sell-out agreement that falls far short of this figure. The UWU's claim that workers have won respect is not only a diversion from the real wage cut, but also a complete lie. This is starkly exposed by the union's own reports just days earlier, that management had dumped a bin of rotting offal near the protesting workers in an attempt to crush the strike. What UWU Secretary Tim Kennedy declares a strong message of hope is in fact a substantial wage cut in real terms. According to the latest official quarterly figures, annual inflation is at 6 percent. But this vastly understates the scale of the cost-of-living crisis confronting low-paid workers, like those at Ingham's. Most of the workers who took part in the strike earn just 25 per hour, little more than the national minimum wage of 23.23. This is a direct result of union-management enterprise agreements enforced over many years by the UWU and its predecessor, the National Union of Workers (NUW). Over the past decade, wages at Ingham's have increased by just 5 per hour in nominal terms. These same UWUNUW-brokered deals have allowed the unlimited use of casual and labour-hire workers since at least 2006 and enforced a ban on toilet breaks, in the name of productivity improvements. Steve McCartney, WA secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), which also covers some of the Ingham's workers, stated these guys have been getting used to getting paid low wages and do not want to push back too hard because of the intimidation. In other words, the union-enforced suppression of struggle over decades has ensured wages are so low that workers are compelled to accept any sell-out deal. The sellout of the Ingham's strike follows a similar pattern to that employed by the UWU in several major disputes in recent years. A key component of these union operations is the isolation of workers from the broader working class. While Ingham's has 12 processing plants around the country, the strike was limited to just two facilities, minimising the impact on profits and undermining workers' power as essential elements in the food supply. In 2020-2021, major supermarket chain Coles locked out 350 workers at its distribution centre in Smeaton Grange, in southwest Sydney, for more than three months, in response to demands for increased pay, redundancy and redeployment provisions, ahead of the warehouse's planned closure. The UWU leadership insisted nothing could be done to prevent the loss of jobs. To ensure that this was true, the union made no attempt to appeal to, or even inform, workers in other Coles warehouses -- where the union also had coverage -- and allowed the company to establish pop-up distribution centres to ensure the impact of the shutdown on profits was negligible. Despite the determined resistance of workers who voted down virtually unchanged union-management agreements more than 10 times, and held out with no strike pay for 14 weeks, the UWU was ultimately able to wear them down and ram through a sell-out deal. Late last year, Pampas bread and pastry workers were herded back to work by the union leadership with a real wage-slashing 4.5 percent nominal pay increase after four weeks on strike. The UWU declared this a historic win, even though the deal fell far short of workers' original demand for 8 percent, or even the meagre 6 percent claim advanced by the union. In reality, the UWU had engineered the vote to return to work, in which only some of the strikers were given a say, through a campaign of isolation and financial deprivation designed to convince workers the company offer was the best they could get. Despite the union's vast financial resources -- some 300 million in assets -- workers received only two payments of 500 in strike pay over the four weeks, a mere fraction of their regular wage. As they did in these previous disputes, the Australian pseudo-left weighed in to promote the deal and whitewash the role of the union. Solidarity declared Ingham's strikes show the way to fight for real wage rises, despite acknowledging that the pay deal still falls short of maintaining real wages and that some workers wanted to continue the strike. The purpose of this is to keep workers chained to the unions and shut down any independent mobilisation of workers for decent wages and conditions. The experience of the Ingham's workers shows once again that workers need to draw conclusions as to the real nature of the unions and their role as the industrial police force of big business. Workers and Ingham's and elsewhere need their own organisations, democratically elected rank-and-file committees that are independent of the trade union apparatus. Through these committees, workers can develop demands based on their own interests and needs, and link up with their counterparts across industries and around the world to mount a unified struggle for these demands. They are not only up against their corporate bosses, which reap massive profits while workers are driven into poverty, but the unions, the pro-business Labor government and the industrial courts. This poses the need to fight for a new political perspective, a socialist alternative to capitalism, under which workers' interests are completely subordinated to the profits demands of the financial and corporate elite.

However, amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the Indian diaspora there has expressed confidence in the country's military and said they want to live peacefully.

According to the Israeli Air Force, the fighter jets attacked a number of targets of the terrorist organisation Hamas throughout the Gaza Strip. Among other things, the planes attacked a military compound and a weapons warehouse. Also, a combat management room in Western Jabaliya was attacked which was used by the terrorist organisation Hamas to direct terrorism against the State of Israel. The conflict continued to intensify on Tuesday, as Hamas also launched a barrage of rockets on Israel's Ashkelon, hours after issuing a warning. Hamas had earlier issued a warning that it would attack Ashkelon at 5 of the clock in retaliation for Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, Times of Israel reported. As the barrage of rockets pounded the coastal city, sirens sounded in the city and other nearby towns. According to the latest updates, at least 900 Israelis have been killed and over 2,600 people are wounded. On the other hand, over 770 Palestinians have also been killed in air raids after Israel launched a strong counter-offensive. The Health Ministry in Gaza said that at least 770 Palestinians have been killed and 4,000 wounded in Israeli air raids. Among the dead are 140 children and 120 women, a ministry spokesperson said. A day ago, in a stern warning to Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that though Israel did not start this war but will finish it. Israel is at war. We did not want this war.

Rescuers are working around the clock to try to save thousands that remain buried following a powerful earthquake that hit Afghanistan's Herat province on Saturday. Rescue workers and volunteers are working around the clock to try to dig out survivors and bodies from the ruins of the villages worst affected, 48 hours after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit. The Taliban's Ministry of Public Health reports more than 2,500 are confirmed dead across 21 villages, but many more casualties are feared. Search and rescue operations remain ongoing, and the exact numbers of casualties and houses, premises, destroyed are still not fully confirmed, a World Health Organization (WHO) official told Al Jazeera. In the Zandehjan district, the epicentre of the quake, 100 percent of homes were totally destroyed, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The agency reports 1,023 dead and 1,663 injured in the district. However, organisations and aid workers in the regional capital Herat told Al Jazeera that the casualty figures are much higher. We have lost count, one volunteer rescuer said. There are always discrepancies when issuing numbers for an event of this magnitude since verification can be challenging. But we can with some certainty say the numbers will increase dramatically as we rescue those still trapped, said Necephor Mghendi, head of delegation at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The effort to find survivors has continued around the clock over the last two days, despite mounting challenges, not least frequent aftershocks. The geographic challenges in remote areas and continuous aftershocks have hindered the operations, said a WHO spokesperson. The rescue workers are using everyday items to dig out victims. They do not have sophisticated equipment and that is slowing down the effort, Mghendi said. For those affected, the delays could be the difference of life and death, said 50-year-old Ahmad, a survivor from Zandehjan. We lost pretty much everything. My father died and my wife is injured. We pulled her out of the debris with our hands. One of my kids is also injured and needs medical assistance, he said. Ahmad, who has been working tirelessly to help find others, pleaded for more support. We need more medical tents and also people to help us dig through the ruins, he said. When found, survivors are taken to local overloaded clinics, he continued, adding, People do not have a home to return to. WHO officials have cautioned that lack of access to medical services is a major concern. In the aftermath of any disaster, women will continue to have babies, people with pre-existing medical conditions will still need their treatment, people will still have acute medical problems from a variety of causes. The maintenance and restoration of essential health care is vital, the WHO spokesperson said. The Red Cross also acknowledged an urgent need for emergency services, as well as other basics, said Mghendi. Shelter is the most urgent issue. The massive destruction of houses has left people exposed to the elements. Many do not have a roof over their head and are vulnerable when the temperature drops at night, he said. There is also a need for essential household items like utensils and water storage containers. Despite the scale of the tragedy, there has been little international support or aid directed towards Afghanistan which, under Taliban rule, finds itself politically isolated. The country is already facing a humanitarian crisis due to a significant reduction in foreign aid from Western countries since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Emergency services have been particularly affected. Local organisations and philanthropists have stepped into the breach, however, mobilising humanitarian support for the survivors of the earthquake. Cricketer Rashid Khan pledged his entire earnings from the 2023 Cricket World Cup to help affected families. Nasrat Khalid, founder of Aseel, an Afghan e-commerce initiative that pivoted its work towards humanitarian support after 2021, said his organisation is working to provide aid to more than 1,000 families. We are also building up the list of Omid IDs from the families that are directly affected have people who are injured or unfortunately has a member of the family killed in the tragedy, he said, referring to digital cards they issue to recipients, to ensure transparent delivery of aid. The digital cards allow Aseel to ensure weekly follow-ups with verified families and track their progress. Such organic efforts are crucial, said Khalid's colleague Samira Gawhary. The international community's response has been limited, with only a few organisations already working in Afghanistan providing support. We have witnessed a strong crowdfunding response on social media, but we have yet to receive substantial support from international donors and organisations, she said, urging those who wished to extend support to make donations through the Aseel website. Humanitarian organisations working in Herat are also turning their attention to the approaching winter, which they warn is a major concern. Winter is less than two months away, noted Mghendi. Exposing people to sub-zero temperatures is a recipe for other health tragedies, so we are racing against time to ensure that people have assistance not only for their immediate needs but also to cope for the coming winter. The urgency is summed up by Ahmad. The farmer is among those that have lost their homes and livelihoods. My house was destroyed and one of my cows killed.

Photograph: Ilan RosenbergReuters As the conflict entered the fourth day since Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel on October 7, the Israeli Air Force launched an extensive attack against terror targets of Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. A combat helicopter attacked another observation post of the Hezbollah terrorist organization. A short time ago a combat helicopter attacked a Hezbollah observation post after anti-tank fire was fired from Lebanese territory at a military vehicle in the Avivim area, the IAF posted on X (formerly Twitter). As per the Israeli Air Force, the fighter jets attacked a number of terrorist targets of the terrorist organization Hamas throughout the Gaza Strip. Among other things, the planes attacked a military compound and a weapons warehouse. Also, a combat management room in Western Jabaliya was attacked which was used by the terrorist organisation Hamas to direct terrorism against the State of Israel, it added. The conflict continued to intensify, as Hamas also launched a barrage of rockets on Israel, hours after issuing a warning. The terrorist organisation had earlier issued a warning that it would attack Ashkelon at 5 of the clock in retaliation for Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, Times of Israel reported. As the barrage of rockets pounded the coastal city, sirens sounded in the city and other nearby towns. The Hamas terror group launched a deadly attack on Israel on October 7. According to the latest updates, at least 900 people have been killed and over 2600 people are wounded. On the other hand, over 770 Palestinians have also been killed in air raids after Israel launched a strong counter-offensive. The Health Ministry in Gaza said that at least 770 Palestinians have been killed and 4,000 wounded in Israeli air raids. Among the dead are 140 children and 120 women, a ministry spokesperson said. In addition to this, at least 18 people have also been killed and around 100 were injured in the West Bank region since Saturday, Al Jazeera reported. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said Tuesday, with another 4,250 people injured Internet disruptions are affecting the death toll updates, the ministry stated, Times of Israel reported. In another major development in the ongoing Israeli counter-offensive, two big leaders of Hamas terror group were eliminated by the Israeli Air Force on Tuesday. The Israeli Air Force said in a statement that the Minister of Economy of Hamas, Jawad Abu Shamala, has been killed. Zakaria Abu Ma'amer, one of the senior members of the Political Bureau of Hamas was also eliminated by the Israeli Air Force. He was also the head of the Ministry of National Relations in the policy bureau of Hamas in Gaza, In a major revelation, an emergency group revealed on Tuesday that as many as 260 people were killed by Hamas gunmen who invaded an outdoor music festival in southern Israel during their assault on the country over the weekend, the Times of Israel reported. The incident has been described by participants as a nightmarish massacre, with terrorists -- who had apparently known in advance of the event and directed significant forces there -- surrounding the participants and cutting down dozens of them with rifle fire, then moving through the area and hunting people in hiding to execute or capture, as per the Times of Israel. Amid the ongoing war between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israel defense forces have announced that schools across the entire country will remain closed in the coming days, according to The Times of Israel. In a stern warning to Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday said that though Israel did not start this war but will finish it. Israel is at war. We did not want this war. It was forced upon us in the most brutal and savage way. But though Israel did not start this war, Israel will finish it, said Netanyahu in an address to the nation. He added, Hamas will understand that by attacking us, they have made a mistake of historic proportions. We will exact a price that will be remembered by them and Israel's other enemies for decades to come. However, despite the Israeli counter-offensive, there has been no change in the attitude of Hamas. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Tuesday that the issue of prisoner swaps will not be addressed until the end of the war, The Times of Israel reported. The head of the Hamas political bureau said that the prisoner exchanges will only be tackled after the end of the war. Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, condemned the joint statement issued by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy against the Hamas attack, terming it double standards and their blatant bias towards Zionist occupation. These positions once again confirm the double standards of these countries, and their blatant bias towards the Zionist occupation...and provide it with a cover and encouragement to continue and escalate its crimes against our defenceless people, Times of Israel quoted al-Rishq as saying. The Hamas group has also called for mass rallies in the West Bank, Jerusalem and throughout the Arab and Muslim world on Friday in support of its fight against Israel. Hamas also extends an appeal to Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as the free people of our Arab and Islamic nation all around the world, to gather in the closest point to Jerusalem in order to show their solidarity with them and stop the Israeli plans to Judaize Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa, Times of Israel reported. Iran is another nation, that has continuously voiced support for Hamas. Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei on Tuesday claimed that Israel has suffered an irrevocable defeat both in terms of military and intelligence, Iranian News Agency Islamic Republic News Agency reported. But those who say that the recent great event is the work of non-Palestinians are making miscalculations Khameni was cited in the IRNA report. Since the beginning of 'Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,' the occupying Zionist regime has suffered an irrevocable defeat both in terms of military and intelligence, Khamenei said as quoted by IRNA. The Israel defence force stated that about 4,500 rockets have been fired from Gaza on Israel after which the Israeli defence forces struck 1290 Hamas targets in Gaza. An IDF spokesperson has confirmed that 123 soldiers have been killed in the fighting, and 50 families have been informed that a relative was kidnapped by Hamas. As part of its counter-offensive against Hamas, Israel has mobilised 3,00,000 troops in the last 48 hours. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari informed about the mobilisation and said the IDF has never mobilized so many reservists so quickly -- 300,000 reservists in 48 hours. This is the largest mobilisation since the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Israel called up 400,000 reservists, Times of Israel reported. The horrific attack by Hamas has received global condemnation. Five nations, the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement condemning the attack. US President posted on X stating that the 'tragedy' incurred by Israel is personal for many American families as the ties between the two nations run deep. This is not some distant tragedy - the ties between Israel and the United States run deep. It is personal for so many American families who are feeling the pain of this attack as well as the scars inflicted through millennia of antisemitism and persecution of Jewish people. In cities across the country, local and federal law enforcement partners are closely monitoring for any domestic threats in connection with the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, Biden posted on X. Earlier in the day, PM Modi talked with his Israeli counterpart and took an update about the ongoing situation. I thank Prime Minister netanyahu for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation. People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, PM Modi said. German Ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann called the attack as heartbreaking and appalling and stated that Germany believes in the right of self-defence of Israel. What we have seen over the weekend in Israel is just heartbreaking and appalling. The attacks by Hamas on Israeli soil, the random killing of people...more than hundreds were killed. I was completely shocked and I could not believe what I saw. The pictures we had to see on social media were just terrible. So we believe in the right of self-defence of Israel. We believe that Israel has every right to defend itself, the envoy said. He added, What is the aim of this attack? What does Hamas want to achieve with this attack? I do not see any improvement in the situation and therefore, I must say I condemn what happened in Israel. The Israel Defense Forces said it had finally regained control over the border with the Gaza Strip, 72 hours after Hamas terrorists blew through sections of the barrier and launched an invasion that saw over 1,000 Israelis slaughtered or kidnapped. On Monday, the Israeli Air Force aircraft attacked several targets of Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. The aircraft attacked a building used by Hamas in investigations and an operational infrastructure located inside a mosque.

Ellison was the co-CEO of Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm that was affiliated with the FTX exchange. She is also Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend. She is testifying shortly after FTX cofounder Gary Wang, also a witness for the prosecution. Both were charged with a series of financial crimes in December, and Ellison pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Securities and Exchange Commission said in December that, at Bankman-Fried's direction, Ellison manipulated the price of a digital token that FTX had issued, and then used it as collateral for undisclosed loans that Alameda took from FTX. That means Alameda, the trading firm, was secretly using the money of FTX customers to cover losses it had sustained. That meant Alameda was telling investors it had more collateral on loans than it really did, making the FTX exchange look safer than it was. Ellison, like Wang before her, is cooperating with the government in exchange for a reduction in her sentence. Without such a deal, both faced sentences that could have kept them in prison for the rest of their lives. Ellison and Wang both had close personal relationships with Bankman-Fried, or SBF, who appeared distressed at times by Wang's testimony against him. Bankman-Fried was sent to jail in August in advance of the trial after the government accused him of witness tampering.

International trade experts, however, project a reduction in profits for domestic exporters. For merchandise exports of India, the war may lead to higher insurance premiums and shipping costs, according to think tank, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). India's Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (ECGC) may charge higher risk premiums from Indian firms exporting to Israel. The ECGC is wholly owned by the Indian government and is responsible for offering the Indian exporters credit insurance covers, thereby promoting Indian exports. According to Sharad Kumar Saraf, Founder Chairman of Technocraft Industries India and Mumbai-based exporter, short-run impacts may be suffered by Indian exports, reported the Business Standard. If the war escalates, things may get bitter for our exporters of that region, Saraf estimated. A similar token was shared by Ajay Srivastava, Co-founder of GTRI, who predicted significant trade disruptions should the conflict impact Israel's main ports, namely the Ports of Eilat, which handles most of India's merchandise trade with Israel, Haifa, and Ashdod. India-Israel bilateral services trade is estimated to be around 1.3 billion. It may have no impact unless war escalates to involve bigger parts of Israel. The real impact would depend on the duration and intensity of the war, Srivastava said. The Port of Ashdod and Haifa, however, are currently open, while the Port of Ashkelon and its oil terminal, located 10 kilometres north of the Gaza Strip border which is currently the target of Israel's attacks, have suspended operations. READ: Haifa Port 1 billion privatisation finalised According to Indian media outlet Business Standard, in 2022-2023, India-Israel trade in merchandise and services is estimated at 12 billion. India's merchandise exports to Israel were 8.4 billion, while imports were 2.3 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of 6.1 billion. Key Indian exports to Israel include diesel (5.5 billion) and cut and polished diamonds (1.2 billion). Key imports, on the other hand, include rough diamonds (519 million) and cut and polished diamonds (220 million), electronics, and telecom components (411 million), potassium chloride (105 million), and herbicide (6 million), reported Business Standard. In recent years, Israel and India have made significant cross-sector investments to one another with the two nations in the negotiation stages of a free trade agreement. Additionally, Business Standard reported that between 2000 and 2023, Israeli firms invested 286 million in India.

And the prospects of additional Ukraine funding will likely come down to whether a narrow -- and currently leaderless -- GOP majority can stomach it, presenting an important early decision that will confront the next House speaker, who has yet to be chosen. Numerous Republicans lawmakers told NBC News they are skeptical -- if not outright opposed -- to connecting the two. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said Congress should first help Israel in the wake of the brutal attack by Hamas, while continuing to debate the merits of helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia's war. We have got to do something Israel today if we can, or tomorrow, he told reporters on Monday evening. Asked why he separates the need to help the two YOU.S. allies who are under attack, Burgess said, referring to Ukraine and Israel, respective: One's an argument that is in process. The other is an acute need, and we need to tend to that first. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., an opponent of Ukraine aid, said they must not be linked. No. They are two separate matters. Not even the same at all, Greene said. Our government's funding Ukraine's government, funding the proxy war with Russia. Israel has their own government. Israel defends themselves. Two separate issues. They should not be tied together. I will not vote to fund Ukraine. Absolutely not, she added. Israel is totally separate. The skepticism comes as the GOP appetite to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia has waned, driven by opposition from former Donald Trump and allies of his right-wing populist MAGA movement. In July, 70 House Republicans supported an amendment by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to cut off military aid to Ukraine. In September, that grew to 93 Republicans. It has sparked a battle within the party, as others like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., emphasize that a victory for Russia in Ukraine would destabilize the global order, benefit China and harm American national security. Many Republicans in both chambers share that view, but they are confronting a party base that is turning against the idea of assisting Ukraine. Even some Republicans who favor aid to Israel and Ukraine are skeptical of linking them. They are both needed. I would not want to connect one to the other, said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. I support both, but to hold one hostage for the other would not be right. It is in our national security interest and it is morally right to help out both, he said. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he is open to linking aid to Israel and Ukraine in a larger package that tackles various foreign policy goals. Yeah, I think that is a possibility -- along with China, Taiwan, border security, McCaul said. There is more widespread support for assisting Israel in both parties, although some progressive Democrats are suggesting that further aid come with strings attached and be paired with efforts to promote peace and stability. Still, Democrats are unlikely to stand in the way of President Joe Biden's forthcoming requests on Israel, making it a safer bet than Ukraine money. The next Republican House speaker, in tandem with the Democratic-controlled Senate and Biden, will face a government funding deadline of November 17. Funding for Israel or Ukraine could be part of appropriations bills or done separately. The speaker would have the power to hold or prevent votes in the full chamber. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., flatly rejected the idea of linking funding for Israel and Ukraine: No. I would not connect those two at all. He said he supports aid to Israel, but not to Ukraine. When it comes to Ukraine, there is no plan, he said. There is nobody that will tell you -- and I get every plan does not come to fruition exactly -- but that says we expect this to be done in six days, six weeks, six months, six years; we expect Putin to be out or stay in Ukraine, or you name it. There is no plan associated with that. I do not buy something that is unrelated to a plan.

Under chair Lina Khan, the FTC has not been shy about taking big swings against some of American's biggest companies in an effort to snuff out monopolistic behavior. But that approach has also led to some high-profile setbacks, most notably in its bid to block acquisitions by Microsoft and Meta. Now, the FTC must prove in court both that Amazon is a monopoly and is using its dominance to prevent competition from flourishing in the marketplace. A final decision in Amazon case will likely come years down the road. Chinese developer Country Garden says it cannot meet debt payment deadlines after sales slump HONG KONG (AP) -- Chinese property developer Country Garden has warned it cannot meet deadlines to repay its loans as the company struggles to restructure its debts. The company's difficulty in paying a 470 million Hong Kong dollar (60 million) loan is the latest sign of distress in the industry after Beijing clamped down on mounting debts in the industry. Country Garden said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that it expects its financial troubles to continue.

Biden is trying again on student loan forgiveness. Here is where the process stands NEW YORK (AP) -- President Joe Biden is making another attempt at student loan cancellation after the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that his administration could not forgive 400 billion in student loan debt using a 2003 law. More than a dozen people chosen by the Biden administration have met to begin a process known as negotiated rule-making to try to bring cancellation to more borrowers under the authority of the Higher Education Act. It is not clear yet who would be eligible for forgiveness or how much relief they would get. Meanwhile, federal student loan borrowers began making payments again this month after a three-year-plus pause due to the pandemic. Star witness Caroline Ellison starts testimony at FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's trial NEW YORK (AP) -- The trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has taken a star turn as his former fellow top executive and ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison began testifying against him. Ellison's highly anticipated turn on the witness stand in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday took place just before the trial broke for lunch, with Ellison blaming Bankman-Fried for crimes she admitted to last December in a cooperation deal. At one point, she was asked to identify Bankman-Fried in the courtroom. She stood up, scanning the courtroom, before spotting him in a row with his lawyers. She identified him, saying he was over there wearing a suit. IMF outlook worsens for a 'limping' world economy. Mideast war poses new uncertainty The International Monetary Fund warns that the world economy has lost momentum from the impact of higher interest rates, the invasion in Ukraine and widening geopolitical rifts. And it now faces a new threat from the war between Israel and Hamas militants. The IMF said Tuesday that it expects global growth to slow to 2.9 in 2024 from an expected 3 this year. The 2024 forecast is down a notch from the 3 it predicted back in July. The deceleration comes at a time when the world has yet to fully mend from a devastating but short-lived COVID-19 recession in 2020 and now could see fallout from the Middle East conflict -- particularly to oil prices. Argentina's populist presidential candidate Javier Milei faces criticism as the peso takes a dive BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's firebrand populist presidential candidate Javier Milei is coming under fire from his rivals who are blaming him for a sharp depreciation of the local currency in the parallel market. Milei is the front-runner to win the October 22 presidential election. He continues to tout his controversial plan for dollarization of the South American country's economy. The Argentine peso has sharply depreciated over the past week. The informal exchange rate closed at around 1,025 pesos per YOU.S. dollar on Tuesday.

Doug Larsen, his wife Amy and their two sons, 11-year-old Christian and 8-year-old Everett, died October 1 when their single-engine aircraft went down near Moab, Utah. They were returning from a family gathering in Scottsdale, Arizona, and had stopped to refuel shortly before the crash. Doug Larsen, who served 29 years with the North Dakota Army National Guard and flew Black Hawk helicopters, was piloting the single-engine Piper Cherokee plane. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the because of the crash. A preliminary report is expected sometime around next week. UTAH PLANE CRASH LEAVES NORTH DAKOTA STATE SENATOR, WIFE AND 2 SONS DEAD: 'HEARTBREAKING LOSS' Funeral services were set for Tuesday in Bismarck, with burial at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery south of Mandan. Larsen, a Republican, was elected to the North Dakota Senate in 2020. He chaired a Senate panel that handled industry- and business-related legislation. He had recently earned his commercial pilot's license, with hopes of one day flying for a major airline, Republican state Sen. Jim Roers told The Associated Press. Larsen had had at least one job offer from commuter airlines, Roers said. Doug and Amy Larsen owned businesses that included a hotel and a company that builds homes. Larsen, 47, was a lieutenant colonel with the North Dakota Army National Guard and mobilized with the military twice, according to the governor's office. He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, Bronze Service Star and Army Aviator Badge, among other honors. He logged about 1,776 total military flight hours, according to a Guard spokesperson. Mourners have left flowers on Larsen's Senate desk at the state Capitol since the crash. Fellow lawmakers gathering for routine meetings at the Capitol have also observed moments of silence for the Larsens and offered remembrances.

Prosecutors are also seeking testimony from former Wisconsin election official Andrew Hitt, one of the fake electors involved in the effort to upend the 2020 vote. Alex Jones will provide evidence to the jury of Kenneth Chesebro's involvement in the conspiracy, including, without limitation, as it relates to his participation in the march on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, a petition filed by prosecutors says. The petition adds that Jones possesses unique knowledge concerning communications between himself and Kenneth Chesebro and other known and unknown individuals involved in the multi-state, coordinated efforts to influence the 2020 election in Georgia and in other states. Trump and his allies are accused of engaging in a fake elector scheme in which they prepared fake certificates of electors in states where Trump lost in 2020 and said the electors were elected through the Electoral College. Prosecutors have said that Cheseboro helped devise and push the fringe legal theory behind the plan. The former House select committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol had also tried to investigate Jones' role in the effort to spread misinformation about the 2020 election. Prosecutors say in another petition that McDaniel also has unique knowledge about Chesebro's involvement in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. The petition says McDaniel will provide evidence to the jury of Kenneth Chesebro's involvement in the conspiracy, including, without limitation, as it relates to communication between co-defendants Donald Trump and John Eastman regarding the conspiracy involving the fake elections in the 2020 election. Hitt was a 2020 Trump elector in Wisconsin and former chair of his state's branch of the Republican Party. Prosecutors say in another filing that Hitt talked with Chesebro when electors met, and his testimony will show that Chesebro was not just a lawyer providing advice. The State anticipates that Mr. Hitt will testify about his interactions with and related to Chesebro as it relates to Chesebro's involvement in the scheme to have Trump presidential elector nominees convene and cast false Electoral College votes in Wisconsin on December 14, 2020, they say. To compel testimony from an out-of-state witness, two judges must sign off: the judge in the jurisdiction where the case is being prosecuted, Judge Scott McAfee, and a judge local to where the witness lives. For McDaniel, that is Michigan; for Jones, that is Travis County, Texas; for Hitt that is Wisconsin. There are certificates that McAfee signed for McDaniel and Jones in the docket, but there was not one for Hitt yet as of Tuesday afternoon.

Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that bans four food additives linked to health problems, marking the first time that a state has outlawed chemicals allowed by the Food and Drug Administration. Starting in 2027, California will prohibit red dye No. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben after Newsom, a Democrat, signed Assembly Bill 418 into law Saturday. All four ingredients have already been made illegal in the European Union and some other parts of the world, but can be found in commonly sold items in the United States, such as some brands of orange soda, icing, hamburger rolls, candies and processed foods. The chemicals have been associated with issues ranging from hyperactivity in children to cancer. Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who introduced the bill with Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a fellow Democrat, said he was elated and deeply grateful to the governor for signing it. The state is stepping up to protect people, he said in a phone interview Tuesday. The law will not result in any foods getting banned from shelves, Gabriel said. Instead, he said, food companies will be required to make really minor modifications using alternative ingredients they already use overseas. We have incredible confidence that consumers are still going to be able to enjoy all the products that we know and love here in the United States, just without those harmful chemicals, he said. The law is likely to have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy health organization that backed the bill. Food and drink manufacturers are unlikely to make a version of their products just for California and could tweak the ingredient lists for as many as 12,000 products sold nationwide, the organization estimated, based on its food database. The four additives serve a variety of purposes -- from making food look more enticing to helping preserve it longer. Red dye No. 3 has long been banned by the FDA from cosmetics because studies show it causes cancer in lab animals in high doses. Yet, the artificial color, which is derived from petroleum, is still used to give foods and medicines a bright red hue. Studies have also indicated that artificial food dyes are associated with behavioral problems in children, including hyperactivity; the FDA maintains there is no evidence of a causal relationship for children in the general population who have not been diagnosed with behavioral disorders. Potassium bromate, a flour additive that helps bread rise higher, has also been linked to cancer in lab animals. Brominated vegetable oil, an emulsifier in citrus drinks, has been tied to behavioral and reproductive issues in lab animals, among other health concerns. And propylparaben, a preservative in cosmetics and food, is believed to mimic estrogen, potentially acting as an endocrine disruptor. Newsom said in a statement that delaying the law's implementation until 2027 should give brands adequate time to revise their recipes and that it was a positive step until the FDA establishes national updated safety levels for these additives. The FDA says it routinely monitors scientific information on ingredients. In an email to NBC News, a spokesperson said the agency evaluates and regulates ingredients added to food to ensure that the authorized use of these ingredients is safe. This includes the four ingredients included in the California bill. The FDA stands by the usage of the ingredients, the spokesperson said, though after reviewing data published in 2022, it is working on a proposed rule to remove the authorization of brominated vegetable oil. Those types of reviews can take years, Gabriel said, adding that he hoped this law would prompt faster change. The first and foremost objective is to protect kids and families and consumers in the state of California, he said. But a secondary objective here was to make a point and to send a message to the FDA and to folks in Washington, D.C., about just how badly the FDA process is broken. The California law was slammed by the National Confectioners Association, a trade association for candymakers. Governor Newsom's approval of this bill will undermine consumer confidence and create confusion around food safety, the group said in a statement. This law replaces a uniform national food safety system with a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements created by legislative fiat that will increase food costs.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"California will prohibit red dye No. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben.

Israel's military on Tuesday claimed to have regained control inside the country after it ordered a full siege of Gaza, meaning that no food, gas or power would be allowed into the densely populated area, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said.

The exact number of hostages taken by Hamas fighters is unknown. No Americans have been confirmed to be among the hostages, but YOU.S. National Security Counsel spokesman John Kirby said that a number of Americans are unaccounted for and that it is possible that are among those being held hostage. In a statement Monday, Biden said at least 11 Americans have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war and that it is likely that some Americans are being held hostage. We are seeing the immense scale and reach of this tragedy, Biden said. In this moment of heartbreak, the American people stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israelis. We remember the pain of being attacked by terrorists at home, and Americans across the country stand united against these evil acts that have once more claimed innocent American lives. It is an outrage. The Biden administration has stated its support for Israel. In his statement, Biden said he reaffirmed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the YOU.S. would continue to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself and its people. In support of Israel, the Biden administration is sending ships of the Navy's USS Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and officials plan to keep in place some F-16 and A-10 fighter jets that were previously scheduled to rotate out of the region, a YOU.S. official told NBC News. The move is intended to signal a message to stand down, an official said. The death toll from the Israel-Hamas war has soared to more than 1,600 people as of Tuesday morning, three days after Hamas fighters launched surprise attacks on Israel, according to officials. More than 900 people died in Israel and at least 770 in Gaza, with over 6,000 people injured in Israel and Gaza, officials said.

Corn and soybean prices also dipped amid rising supply from the ongoing YOU.S. harvest and record crops in top exporter Brazil. Abundant cheap grain flowing from Russia is keeping prices low and a significant change will be needed for the market to shift, said Andrew Whitelaw at Australian agricultural consultancy Episode 3. All that matters is what is happening in the Black Sea, he said. The most-active Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat futures were down 1.1 at 5.66-34 a bushel by 0418 GMT, near last month's three-year low of 5.40. CBOT corn fell 0.4 to 4.86-12 a bushel and soybeans were 0.5 lower at 12.57-34 a bushel. Agricultural consultancy IKAR raised its forecasts for Russia's grain crop this year to 141.2 million metric tonnes from 140.0 million and lifted its estimate for Russian grain exports to 64.5 million tonnes in the 202324 season from 64.0 million. IKAR also said Russian wheat export prices continued to decline last week, with 12.5-protein wheat for free-on-board (FOB) delivery in early November down 5 to 230 a ton. But analysts say Russian wheat exports in October will fall considerably due to weak demand from major importers and informal government restrictions. The Sovecon agriculture consultancy estimated Russian wheat exports in October at 3.9-4.4 million tons, down from 5 million in September and 4.5 million in October last year.

Twenty workers interviewed for this story said labor supply firms told workers they could not go home to Nepal unless they paid exit fees that often equaled several months' wages. Mansur is back home in Nepal, cultivating crops on his family's small plot of land. But he is still angry at the firms he blames for his agony in the Arabian Peninsula. He asks himself: What sin did I commit to end up in Saudi? Amazon told NBC News that Mansur had a good work record, and would be welcome to return to employment with the company. The interviews with workers describe practices that are considered by experts to be markers for potential labor trafficking under YOU.S. law and YOU.N. standards. These include subjecting workers to abusive working and living conditions; restricting their movement; and making false statements about the identity of the employer. YOU.N. standards say any recruitment fees should be paid by the employer, not the worker. Several workers said they complained to Amazon warehouse managers or human resources officials about low or missing wages, poor housing conditions and the strains of warehouse work. Amazon said it is working to improve oversight of its labor suppliers and prevent future violations of its standards. We are implementing stronger controls for all our vendors to ensure similar incidents do not occur and to raise overall standards for workers in the region, including providing enhanced trainings for our third-party vendors on labor rights standards with a specific focus on recruitment, wages and deception, said Felton in his written statement to NBC News. Amazon does not tolerate violations of our long-established supply chain standards or global human rights principles, and we take any allegation of violation extremely seriously, Felton stated. Read the full Amazon response here. Amazon entered the Saudi Arabian market in 2017, when it purchased the Middle Eastern online retail giant Souq.com, which had started in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. It rebranded Souq under the Amazon name and boosted its labor force by bringing in workers from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal. In 2023, Amazon reported employing nearly 1,500 permanent and seasonal workers in Saudi Arabia. As one of Asia's poorest countries, Nepal has long been a major source of foreign workers employed overseas by companies large and small. These workers send money to families back home. The World Bank reported that in 2022, overseas remittances back home accounted for 23 percent of Nepal's gross domestic product. Many Nepali workers have heard horror stories from family and friends facing bad working and living conditions overseas. In a survey published in 2017 in the prestigious British medical journal BMJ, most Nepali men who have worked outside the country indicated that they had experienced exploitation at all stages of the migration process. Half reported being targets of deceptive recruiting practices. Like many Nepali workers, Mansur knew it is better to seek direct employment rather than working for a labor supply company. When an agent with Rove International, a recruiting firm based in Kathmandu, offered him work at Amazon, Mansur did research. He decided a big American corporation like Amazon might differ from other companies that had abused fellow Nepali workers. Knowing that agents tell lies, he said, he asked repeatedly whether he would be an employee of Amazon or a labor supply company. The agent confirmed to me that it was direct employment from Amazon, Mansur said, and it would change my life. He was surprised, he said, when Rove International told him that he must pay a recruiting fee of over 2,300 -- especially since he knew Nepal's government caps the fees that employment firms can charge workers heading to Saudi Arabia at less than 85. Six other Nepalis confirm that Rove International charged them recruiting fees of more than 1,000 each. Like other Nepali workers, Mansur said he paid the fee. He saw it as the cost for an opportunity to work for Amazon. Nepali workers heading to Saudi Arabia are especially vulnerable because Nepal's government has failed to enforce its policies forbidding recruiting agencies from charging high fees, according to Nepal's parliament, its Supreme Court and the YOU.S. State Department. Workers seeking jobs in the Middle East are also at risk because of the kafala system -- a matrix of labor and immigration laws in some Gulf states that gives employers control over migrant workers' employment and immigration status. In Saudi Arabia and other countries where forms of the kafala system still exist, many foreign workers are fearful they can be punished if they leave an employer. In September 2021, Mansur traveled from his home in southern Nepal to Kathmandu and got on a Jazeera Airways flight -- the first time he would ever flown and his first time outside Nepal. When he arrived in Riyadh, Mansur and other new workers from Nepal were met by Amazon officials -- or so Mansur thought. A few days into his job at an Amazon warehouse, Mansur noticed that his green ID badge differed from the blue badges worn by many other workers. The workers with blue badges were employed directly by Amazon, a co-worker explained. Those wearing green badges were not direct Amazon employees -- they were temporary workers from a labor supply provider. He learned he was working for Al-Mutairi, not directly for Amazon. Records show Nepal's Department of Foreign Employment issued work permits in September 2021 to Mansur and 36 other Nepalis whose labor contracts were being channeled to Al-Mutairi by Rove International, the Nepali recruiting firm. Heera Lal Shah, managing director of Rove International, said the company followed all legal procedures set by the government, and these workers knew where and how they were going to work. He did not respond further to questions detailing worker allegations. Forty-eight of the 54 Nepali workers interviewed for this story said recruiters misled them about the terms of their employment, falsely promising they would work directly for Amazon. During their time in Saudi Arabia, the workers said, they were paid less than those who work directly for Amazon. We worked more and harder, but the salary we received was much less, Mansur said. Inside Amazon's distribution centers, the pace is fierce. Pickers roam the floors, grabbing items and handing them off to packers, who stand for hours at a time. Workers said managers watch pickers through closed-circuit cameras and monitor their movements. Nepali workers report that Amazon supervisors stalked them up and down the aisles of the warehouse, yelling, Yalla! Yalla! -- Arabic for hurry. During a normal shift, Mansur covered as many as 9 miles across warehouse floors. I would feel extremely weak. My legs would hurt, he said. When I returned home, I would feel like I was being pierced with needles or walking barefoot on stones. My whole body would ache. More than 20 workers were interviewed this summer while they were still employed at Amazon warehouses in Saudi Arabia. They agreed to talk only if their names were not published because they feared retaliation for speaking out. They echoed many of the concerns that Mansur and former workers raised. Amazon makes people work like cattle, said one current worker who said he had to pay a substantial recruiting fee and now lives in squalid housing. Amazon is a big company. I had a dream of earning money. I wanted to do something after earning money. But it did not happen. What I expected did not come true. During rush periods -- such as sales or holidays -- supervisors monitored restroom activity, sometimes admonishing them, workers said, for taking too much time away from the warehouse floor. They wanted us not to take breaks when there was a high work demand, said Surendra Kumar Lama, who worked at an Amazon warehouse in Saudi Arabia from 2021 until the end of 2022, and who Amazon said was, like Mansur, a good employee who would be welcome to return to the company. They would stand near restrooms and water stations because workers are afraid of them. Many times, I waited half an hour or an hour to go to the restroom because they were there. After a long day at Amazon's warehouses, workers come home to living accommodations provided by Al-Mutairi. Many said the housing units are cramped and squalid, with cockroaches scuttling across the floor and a briny water supply that caused rashes. Often, workers said, sleeping mattresses were infested with bed bugs and at times air conditioners -- much needed for living in the hot desert country -- were not functioning. How can eight people stay together in a small room? Mansur said. There was no space to put personal belongings. We would keep those on our beds. In some cases, workers successfully lobbied Amazon officials to prod Al-Mutairi to address the housing problems, but improvements often did not last, according to workers. When they reported the water issue to Amazon, said one former worker, Al-Mutairi threatened us: 'Who complained about this? We will make him jobless!' Other workers reported similar threats. Al-Mutairi was strict about requests for time off for family emergencies back home in Nepal, according to 23 current and former workers. The labor supply firm, they said, will give a worker two choices: He can pay a large fine upfront. Or he can persuade co-workers to sign a guarantor contract agreeing that they will pay a fine on his behalf if he does not return to Saudi Arabia to complete his labor contract. One former worker said he missed the birth of his son and his father's funeral because Al-Mutairi would not let him go home. Even after he showed the firm his father's death certificate, he said, the company said he could go only if he paid a penalty of 1,600 -- more than four months' salary. He could not afford it, and he could not find a co-worker willing to sign as his guarantor, he said. I could not be with my dad when he died. I could not hold and look at my son when he came into this world, the former worker said. During his time in Saudi Arabia, he said, I did not achieve anything, but I lost many things. One afternoon in May 2022, a few hours before his next shift began, a message popped up on Mansur's mobile phone: Do not go to duty, it said, and listed dozens of names as people stopped from Amazon. He found his own name on the list. He would been laid off. The laborers from Nepal had come to the Arabian Peninsula expecting they would be working difficult but steady jobs. Instead, they found that job security is almost nonexistent. Every day, we fear that we could be terminated the next day. We work every day as the last day of our work, said a Nepali still working in an Amazon warehouse in Riyadh. Once laid off, workers said, a new ordeal begins. They lose housing reserved for those working at Amazon, they said, and are shunted to worse housing set aside for those without jobs. They get no wages or money for food. Many languish for weeks or months waiting for Al-Mutairi to place them back with Amazon or some other business. During Mansur's stay, he survived by eating kuboos -- Arab flatbread -- once a day and borrowing money from former co-workers. Some days, he said, he did not eat at all. When his friends could no longer support him and Al-Mutairi did not find him another job, he decided to pay the exit penalty and go back to Nepal. It was better going home than dying of hunger, he said. Other jobless workers have slipped away from the accommodations and worked illegally in construction and restaurants without proper work papers, despite the risk that they could be detained. Loneliness, hunger and stress pushed some jobless workers toward dark turns of thought. Manish Kumar Sodari, an Amazon worker who said he was laid off for making too many errors gathering items in the warehouse, said he spent days caring for another laid-off worker who was talking about hanging himself. Soon, Sodari said, he began having suicidal thoughts himself. How can one stay helpless for three to four months? he told a reporter in January. I have already suffered a lot. I am at the last stage. He said he returned home to Nepal several months later, and is now working in India. Saudi Arabia announced reforms of its labor regulations in 2021 that authorities claim make it easier for workers to change jobs and leave the country. But human rights advocates said migrant workers in the region remain vulnerable because these limited protections have yet to be widely implemented or enforced. Migrant workers are still facing severe abuses despite these highly touted reforms, said Michael Page, a Human Rights Watch official. Workers are still unable to change jobs easily without the permission of their old employer. Mansur feels guilty about the unpaid loans that he and his family took to get him to the Arabian Peninsula, and to bring him back to Nepal. Interest charges are piling up. He fears the village moneylenders will seize the family's land. I lost time and money working at Amazon. I lost everything, he said. I lost my body and my strength. ... My family's financial situation is devastated now. But like many migrant workers around the globe, Mansur is not going to let that harrowing experience stop him from trying to find an employer that pays a fair wage and treats him decently. He is begun to look again for an overseas job. He is open to working most anywhere -- except Saudi Arabia.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Twenty workers interviewed for this story said labor supply firms told workers they could not go home to Nepal unless they paid exit fees.

Getty Iconic landmarks and buildings across Western cities around the world - from New York's Empire State Building to the EU headquarters in Brussels and the federal parliament house in Sydney - are being lit up in blue and white as an official show of support for Israel. This response is, unfortunately, predictable from Western powers, who have long shielded Israel from any form of accountability for its decades-long brutal military occupation of Palestinian land. Still, there will come a day when this moment will be marked in history books as the shameful rallying of imperial, settler colonial states behind a violent, racist, apartheid settler colony regime, one that is founded and sustained on the domination and oppression of the Indigenous Palestinian people of the land. In July of this year, Israel violently raided and attacked the Jenin refugee camp, displacing 4,000 Palestinian refugees; destroying homes, roads, electricity, water, and sewage networks; and damaging hospitals while blocking ambulance access. But no Palestinian flag was displayed on any Western landmarks. For seventy-five years, Palestinians have implored the world to hold Israel to account. In return, Western governments and Arab lapdog puppet regimes have enabled and empowered Israel to act with impunity as it commits war crimes and crimes against humanity In May 2021, Israel bombed Gaza during the holy month of Ramadan, indiscriminately killing 260 Palestinians, wiping out entire families and neighbourhoods. But no Palestinian flag was displayed on any Western landmarks. Every year during Ramadan, Israel attacks and brutalises Palestinians visiting the Al Aqsa mosque compound to perform prayers and desecrates the holy site. But no Palestinian flag is displayed on any Western landmarks. Israeli settlers routinely desecrate Christian cemeteries, spit at Palestinian Christian pilgrims, chant Death to Arabs ... Death to Christians. But no Palestinian flag is displayed on any Western landmarks. In 2018, when thousands of Palestinians peacefully marched along the Gaza border during the Great March of Return, Israel shot to kill and permanently maim Palestinian protestors with live ammunition, killing 214 Palestinians and injuring 36,100 more, including over 8,800 children. But no Palestinian flag was displayed on any Western landmarks. Israel bombed Gaza in 2008 and 2014, killing thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of children, and injuring and displacing over 10,000 people. But no Palestinian flag was displayed on any Western landmarks. In 2009, Israel repeatedly exploded white phosphorus shells over Gaza's residential areas, a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital. Reports are now emerging that Israel is using these chemical weapons again this time. But no Palestinian flag has been displayed on any Western landmarks. Since 2000, Israel has killed more than 2,300 Palestinian children, and detained hundreds more every year. But no Palestinian flag has been displayed on any Western landmarks. There are more than 5,200 Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli jails, including 160 children, and more than 1,000 are detained arbitrarily without charge or trial. But no Palestinian flag has been displayed on any Western landmarks. In violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel has systematically expelled Palestinians from their land and homes, bulldozing Palestinian homes, appropriating thousands of acres of Palestinian land, and expanding its illegal settlements. But no Palestinian flag has been displayed on any Western landmarks. Israeli settlers living on stolen Palestinian land regularly attack Palestinians, storming villages and setting fire to Palestinian property with complete impunity, such as the pogroms in Huwara earlier this year. But no Palestinian flag has been displayed on any Western landmarks. For more than five decades, Israel has illegally occupied Palestinian in the longest military occupation in modern history, and implemented a system of apartheid. Gaza has been under blockade for 16 years, its residents forced to live in an open-air prison. Still, no Palestinian flags have been displayed on Western landmarks. For seventy-five years, Palestinians have implored the world to hold Israel to account. In return, Western governments and Arab lapdog puppet regimes have enabled and empowered Israel to act with impunity as it commits war crimes and crimes against humanity, and subjects Palestinians to settler-colonial violence, a system of apartheid and collective punishment. Palestinians have never doubted that 'peace talks', 'diplomacy', and 'negotiations' are rhetorical shields Western governments deploy to entrench the status quo and maintain Israel's domination and oppression of Palestinians. But now that Palestinians have broken out of their prison, the sheer dehumanisation of Palestinians by Western powers is undeniable. Palestinians have broken out of a prison that has been declared criminal, against international law, inhumane, illegal, a ticking time bomb, and a humanitarian disaster, by every credible human rights organisation in the world, including those within the West. Whilst the ruling elites stand with the Israeli regime, and official government buildings and landmarks light up in blue and white, the streets around the world are red, black and green for Palestine Today, the deplorable message that Western governments have sent in lighting their buildings in white and blue is blatantly clear: we give Israel permission to use whatever force is necessary to punish Palestinians for daring to escape and to forcibly return them to that prison. The lights are clear vindication that messaging Palestinians as culpable terrorists and Israel as victim, will avoid any threat to the multi-billion-dollar military, surveillance technology  armaments industry which Israel and Western governments are heavily invested in. By painting Palestinian resistance against an illegal occupation as terrorism, while defending the Israeli regime as victims, Western powers also continue to justify the multi-billion dollar surveillance and weapons industry as well as the vast military aid sent to Israel to sustain its occupation. We know that the technologies of violence tested and enacted on Palestinian bodies in the laboratories of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel are being exported and used by Western governments against racialised, marginalised communities in their own societies. And yet, the lights are in a way a victory for Palestinians. Because whilst the ruling elites stand with the Israeli regime, and official government buildings and landmarks light up in blue and white, the streets around the world are red, black and green for Palestine. Around the world, thousands march in solidarity with Palestine. Palestinians and their supporters around the world will continue to fight for freedom long after the lights on buildings are switched off. The ruling elite wave the Israeli flag to flex and consolidate their power and perpetuate their structures of injustice. The people in the streets wave the Palestinian flag to demonstrate their solidarity with those fighting for dignity, freedom and liberation.

It found that around 750 million people could experience one week per year of potentially deadly humid heat if temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. At 3C of warming, more than 1.5 billion people would face such a threat, according to the paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The world is on track for 2.8C of warming by the year 2100 under current policies, according to the 2022 United Nations Emissions Gap report. While India, Pakistan and the Gulf already have briefly touched dangerous humid heat in recent years, the study found it will afflict major cities from Lagos, Nigeria, to Chicago, Illinois if the world keeps heating up. It is coming up in places that we did not think about before, said Vecellio, highlighting rising risk in South America and Australia. At 4C of warming, Hodeidah, Yemen, would see around 300 days per year of potentially unsurvivable humid heat. To track such moist heat, scientists use a measurement known as 'wet-bulb' temperature. This is taken by covering a thermometer with a water-soaked cloth. The process of water evaporating from the cloth mirrors how the human body cools down with sweat. In a landmark 2010 study, Huber proposed that a wet-bulb temperature of 35C persisting for six or more hours could be the conservative limit for the human body. Beyond this, people were likely to succumb to heat stress if they could not find a way to cool down. A decade later, a group of American scientists co-led by Vecellio put Huber's theory to the test by placing young, healthy adults in environmental chambers with high wet-bulb temperatures. They found the limit was lower at between 30C and 31C. Huber and Vecellio joined forces for Monday's study to apply this lower limit to the world under various future climate warming scenarios, ranging between 1.5C and 4C. This will be a critical benchmark for future studies, said atmospheric scientist Jane Baldwin of University of California Irvine who was not involved in the research. Unfortunately, it is a somewhat grimmer picture than you would have gotten with the 35C limit, she said. Monday's research adds to a growing body of concern about dangerous wet-bulb temperatures. Another study published last month in Sciences Advances used Vecellio's threshold alongside weather station data and climate models to reach a similar conclusion: that the geographic range and frequency of dangerous humid heat will increase rapidly under even moderate global warming.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"1.5 billion people could face deadly humid heat each year under a 3C global temperature rise, a new study shows.

At Ben Gurion airport only Terminal 3 is operating and Terminal 1 has been temporarily closed. 60,000 passengers are expected to pass through Ben Gurion airport today, including many Israelis returning home from vacations abroad and soldiers cutting short overseas stays to return to their army units. Many foreign carriers including Lufthansa, Air France and Wizz Air have cancelled all flights to and from Israel, due to problems about insurance coverage, which does not allow them to fly to Israel during time of war. Technically airlines do not need to compensate passengers for canceled flights during war time, which is considered 'force majeure,' but in practice these airlines will likely issue alternative tickets at a later date or repay passenger fares. Passengers wishing to cancel flights can do so within 14 business days of booking the flight but are required to pay a 5 or NIS 100 cancellation fee. Israeli airlines are being flexible on this matter and have added flights abroad for Israelis wishing to return home. Extra flights have been added to Bucharest, Prague and Athens. Arkia is permitting travelers to cancel their flights over the next three days by email without any cancellation fee. El Al has said there are no changes in its flight schedules but travelers abroad can bring forward their flight home to before October 13 free of charge, while passengers due to fly abroad before October 13 can freeze their tickets without any fees. Passengers abroad and due to return before October 13 can postpone their flight home free of charge. Israir is offering a similar flexibility. Passengers whose departure date from Tel Aviv is prior to October 13, will be able to cancel or postpone their trip without cancellation fees and receive a voucher for future redemption of the amount. Passengers who want to bring forward their flight to Israel and return before October 13, will be able to do so without fees depending on the available seats on the flight.

Some of those racing in the heat ended up on the verge of collapse, vomiting and severely dehydrated after the chequered flag while Williams' rookie Logan Sargeant felt too ill to continue. The International Automobile Federation said in a statement it had begun an analysis into the situation in Qatar to provide recommendations for future situations of extreme weather conditions. Measures may include guidance for competitors, research into modifications for more efficient airflow in the cockpit, and recommendations for changes to the calendar to align with acceptable climatic conditions, amongst others. Research from other series, such as cross-country events in extreme climates, will be examined for potential applications to circuit events. The FIA said measures would be discussed at a meeting of its medical commission in Paris. The track temperature during the night race at the Lusail circuit, where Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a third world title, never dropped below 36 degrees Celsius (96.8F), while daytime temperatures exceeded 40 degrees. The FIA noted that next year's race in Qatar will be held in December, when temperatures should be lower, but said it preferred to take material action now to avoid a repeat of this scenario. While being elite athletes, they should not be expected to compete under conditions that could jeopardise their health or safety, it said. Verstappen told reporters on Sunday that some of the guys who were struggling today are extremely fit, probably even fitter than me, but just the whole day it is like you are walking around in a sauna. The inaugural Qatar Grand Prix in 2021 was held in late November. There was no race in 2022 due to the country hosting the soccer World Cup. The calendar, which now has four races in the Middle East, is put together by the commercial rights holder and then approved by the FIA.

Confirming this, Marcus Henschel, a spokesman for the federal police at the airport said that the police took the travelers to an isolated gate and subjected them to vigorous security screenings. He also said that all 198 passengers and 16 crew members left the plane without incident. The luggage was screened and searched thoroughly, but when the police did not find anything objectionable by 2:15 p.m. local time, they reopened the airport to regular traffic. Henschel said further that the threat was determined to be credible and so we initiated the appropriate response. He told 'The New York Times' that many recipients including the federal police at the airport received an email containing the threat. The spokesperson told Reuters that no takeoffs or landings were possible because the airport fire brigade was involved with the search. The German Air Force on its X account claimed to have escorted a civilian aero plane due to a bomb threat. It said in the post, This morning our alarmrotte from Laage was activated. A civilian aircraft on the way from Tehran to Hamburg was accompanied by us, after a bomb threat, after entering German airspace east of Berlin until it landed in Hamburg. The flight was operated by Iran Air, the country's national carrier. Hamburg's airport is Germany's fifth largest and it handles around 11 million passengers every year. The bomb scare came at a time when more than one thousand people have been killed and thousands of others have been injured in the battle between Israel Defense Forces and the pro-Palestinian militant outfit Hamas.

In what looks to be a prolonged war, though, the Democratic president is sure to face competing pressures that will make his commitment harder to keep. Biden has given no hint that he will second-guess the Israeli government's plans to defend the country. He quickly ordered an aircraft carrier group closer to Israel and moved to supply Israel with needed munitions. Eleven Americans were killed in the attacks -- one more reason the two old allies stand shoulder-to-shoulder, Biden said in a statement Monday. We remember the pain of being attacked by terrorists at home, he said, invoking the attacks on YOU.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001. Inside Biden's party, progressives have already signaled that if they see the civilian Palestinian death toll rise, they will insist that he press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scale back the lethality of the counterattack. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., released a statement Monday saying, I grieve the Palestinian and Israel lives lost yesterday, today, and every day. She then called on Israel to lift its blockade of Gaza and dismantle what she called Israel's apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance. While Tlaib was the first to issue such a pronouncement, others are likely to follow suit. She is part of a vocal wing of the Democratic Party that has become increasingly critical of Israel and YOU.S. aid to the country. She and several other progressive lawmakers boycotted a speech to Congress in July by Israel's president, Isaac Herzog. Centrist voices within the Democratic Party are sending a message more aligned with Biden. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York pledged, to do all I can to deliver everything Israel requires in this time of urgent need. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., wrote in a social media post: Radical Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists have brutally murdered and kidnapped Israeli children, women, men, and grandparents, including Americans. We must continue our work to provide Israel with the resources she needs to defend herself from terror. Across the aisle, Republicans are accusing Biden of not doing enough to bolster Israel's security -- even if they are mired in an intra-party fight that has paralyzed the YOU.S. House and left members unable to quickly provide aid. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who was recently ousted as House Speaker, held a press conference Monday morning and suggested that the Biden administration has coddled Iran, which has historically funded Hamas. Republicans joined calls for Israel to decimate the portion of Gaza where the attacks originated. Former Ambassador to the YOU.N. Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential candidate, wrote in a social media post on Monday, They are blood-thirsty murderers who chant 'death to Israel,' death to America.' Finish them. Whether Biden's unflinching resolve lasts may hinge on the war's civilian toll. Reeling from the worst attack on its soil in a half-century, Israel has ordered a siege of Gaza and has cut off electricity and food to a coastal enclave that is home to two million people. I think the gloves are off, Michael Herzog, Israel's ambassador to the YOU.S., said Monday on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports. We will wage war until we destroy the war machine. And they should be clear about it. Images of civilian bombing victims in Gaza may trigger demands from the left wing of the Democratic Party that Biden use his influence in Jerusalem to moderate the attacks. That sort of backlash has happened before. As Israel bombed Gaza in 2014 in response to Hamas rocket attacks, then-President Barack Obama called on both sides of the conflict to act with reasonableness and restraint. The earlier skirmish is nothing like the attack that Israel suffered over the weekend. With more than 900 dead in Israel and others taken hostage, an Israeli military spokesman called the stunning, coordinated assault from Hamas our 911. As with 911, many countries are rallying to Israel's side and urging that it wipe out the perpetrators. The Star of David was projected onto 10 Downing Street in London, home of the prime minister. At home, the White House was lit up at dusk Monday in blue and white -- the colors of the Israeli flag. The president has been particularly clear that Israel has every right to defend itself from what is the worst terrorist attack probably in the history of the state of Israel, Tom Nides, the Biden administration's former ambassador to Israel, told NBC News in an interview. It would be the equivalent of 40,000 or 50,000 Americans dying. Hamas is a terrorist organization that has one objective, which is to destroy the state of Israel, Nides continued. And given that they have taken more than 100 hostages, including some Americans, Israel has every right to do what they need to do to get those bodies back. Even the most disciplined of armies would be hard-pressed to avoid civilian casualties, given the battlefield. The Gaza Strip is densely populated, and Israeli forces are expected to open a ground offensive in which more residential buildings could become targets. I know how Israel approaches these issues, David Friedman, YOU.S. ambassador to Israel in the Trump administration, said in an interview. They have every incentive not to kill civilians. They do not want to kill civilians. But Hamas is without any morals, and they will deploy and hide within civilian populations. One thing is certain: the flare-up in the Middle East is another in a series of foreign policy crises that have been piling up on Biden's watch, testing his foreign policy bona fides ahead of the 2024 election. In Europe, Ukraine is locked in a prolonged war with Russia; in Asia, China's aggressive military moves have stoked fears that it might invade Taiwan. Trying to capitalize on the moment, former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is arguing that the Hamas attack would not have happened on his watch. He is made the same argument about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Neither contention can be proved or disproved. But Trump's critics worry that the claim will make an impression on voters, nonetheless. This is an evidence-free claim, said John Bolton, former national security adviser under Trump and one of the former president's most vocal critics. But I am worried for myself -- and Biden's people have got to be very worried -- that a lot of voters will look at it that way.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Biden has given no hint that he will second-guess the Israeli government's plans.

The 141-year-old schooner Grace Bailey was returning to Rockland, Maine at the end of a four-day cruise, her last scheduled trip of the season, when the mast broke around 10 a.m. on Monday morning. The vessel built in 1882 has operated since the 1990s offering cruises. The owners report on their website that the vessel, which is 118 feet in overall length, is in originally condition with the only major alteration being the addition of accommodations for 29 passengers. The ship was completing a Fall Foliage Cruise this morning when the mast without warning broke and fell on to the deck. Charlie Weidman of a local marine service company told the Associated Press that he was among the first on the scene and found the crew already performing CPR. He reported that one of the victims had a head injury and that two others had had crush and spinal injuries. The YOU.S. Coast Guard reports it received a distress call and sent a crew from Rockland to provide assistance. They rushed one woman with serious injuries to shore and EMS personnel, but reported she was pronounced dead. They then ferried EMS personnel to the vessel to threat the three others that had been injured when the vessel demasted.

READ MORE: Weather expert forecasts warm temperatures for coming days before major YOU-turn It is very rare that Shannon is forced to closed as a result of poor visibility and is usually the airport that handles flights from Cork, Knock and Dublin airports when visibility is poor there. Last night however, dense fog forced airport authorities to close the airport after visibility dropped below safe operating limits. The poor visibility at Shannon was compounded by ongoing essential works being undertaken on a taxiway at the airport. This prevented the airport from implementing 'low visibility procedures' which they would otherwise have been able to. A number of flights to and from Shannon Airport were cancelled while no flight have operated in or out of Shannon since the airport was closed shortly after 11.00pm last night. Several inbound flights which were already on approach to Shannon opted to divert to Dublin Airport. In a statement this morning, a Shannon Airport spokesperson said: Due to unexpected heavy fog conditions during a period of essential taxiway maintenance work, Shannon Airport remains temporarily closed. As a result, flights in and out of Shannon Airport may be cancelled or delayed this morning, Monday 9th October. Passengers are advised to check their flight status directly with the airline in advance of travelling to the airport. The runway is expected to reopen later this morning once the fog clears, subject to weather conditions. We will continue to update passengers across our social media channels. Meanwhile, the Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter was prevented from landing at University Hospital Galway (UHG) last night as a result of poor visibility. Rescue 115 had been tasked to airlift a patient to hospital from Inis Orr, the smallest of the Aran Islands. The helicopter crew had planned flying the patient to UHG however on approach to the hospital visibility was too poor to attempt and approach or landing. As a result, the helicopter flew the patient to University Hospital Limerick before returning to land in Shannon before the airport was forced to close.

More than 40 ex-patients have also accused Hyatt in civil suits of imprisoning them against their will. An arrest warrant alleging Medicaid fraud was filed Monday for an Arkansas psychiatrist who once ran the state's medical board, according to a court document from Pulaski County, Arkansas, obtained by NBC News. An affidavit filed with the arrest warrant alleges that Dr. Brian Hyatt billed Medicaid for its most expensive billing codes while he was running the locked behavioral unit at the Northwest Medical Center in Springdale, even though investigators concluded that he was rarely in the building. It is unclear whether Hyatt is in custody. More than 40 former patients have also accused Hyatt in civil lawsuits of having imprisoned them against their will while he was running the locked behavioral health unit from February 2018 through May 2022. Hyatt's contract with the hospital was abruptly terminated when Medicaid fraud allegations first surfaced in May 2022. He stepped down as chairman of the State Medical Board this March and then resigned from the board altogether in May. The affidavit lays out an alleged scheme in which Hyatt is accused of billing Medicaid for treatment he did not provide. The affidavit is signed by a Medicaid fraud control unit investigator for state Attorney General Tim Griffin. Griffin's office declined to comment on the case. A confidential informant told the attorney general's office that Hyatt had little or no contact with patients and did not want the patients to know his name, according to the affidavit. The confidential informant also told investigators that Hyatt's unit allegedly used chemical restraints when patients were not an imminent danger to themselves or others. Attorney Aaron Cash, who is representing dozens of clients who have sued Hyatt for wrongful imprisonment, told NBC News, Our clients were relieved to learn the news about Dr. Hyatt's arrest warrant and are thankful to Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their work in helping find justice for the many other victims of his scheme. Hyatt's civil attorney did not respond to a request for comment by phone or email, and a criminal defense attorney was not listed in court filings. There was no response to an email and a voice mail message sent to his practice. An attorney for Hyatt had provided a statement to Arkansas Business. Dr. Hyatt continues to maintain his innocence and denies the allegations made against him, the statement said. Despite his career as an outstanding clinician, Dr. Hyatt has become the target of a vicious, orchestrated attack on his character and service. He looks forward to defending himself in court. In July, Northwest Arkansas Medical Center told NBC News, We believe hospital personnel complied in all respects with Arkansas law, which heavily relies on the treating physician's assessment of the patient, including in decisions related to involuntary commitment. When Hyatt began running the unit in 2018 there were 29 beds. By 2022 Hyatt had expanded the unit to 77 beds. In an interview with state investigators, Hyatt said of his interactions with patients, I would see everybody and look in on everybody, according to the affidavit. But the attorney general's office used footage from 40 security cameras to track Hyatt's time over 46 days in the unit and found that he spent 70 of his time in his office and just less than 1 or fewer than 10 minutes seeing patients. In April the hospital agreed to pay back 1.1 million in a settlement with the Arkansas Attorney General's office. The YOU.S. Attorney's office for the Western District of Arkansas and the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General previously confirmed an ongoing investigation of Hyatt.

Emily Allen alleged that her document was ruined after she placed it in a self-service check-in machine at Heathrow Airport on September 8. She said the machine left an inch-long tear on her passport photo. The holidaymaker was set to jet off to an all-inclusive trip to Corfu with her husband and children before the disaster took place with British Airways. Emily said she alerted a member of airline staff who reportedly suggested I buy some sellotape from an airport shop and patch it up myself. There is no universal rule on how damaged a passport can be to still be able to board a plane. However, airlines could be penalised if they allow someone on the plane who is later turned away at their destination. Writing to Telegraph Travel for advice on her ordeal, Emily explained what happened: On the morning of September 8, me, my husband and our two young children were due to travel on a British Airways flight to Corfu for an all-inclusive, one-week holiday. When we arrived at Terminal 5 departures, I used BA's self-service check-in machines to print our boarding passes. Initially, I placed my passport into the machine the wrong way around, so slid it back out carefully and turned it around. During this process the photoobservations page, which on my 2016 document is not laminated - just paper covered by a thin film patch - ripped, leaving an inch-long tear across the edge of the passport photo. The situation soon escalated, however, she claimed British Airways refused to let her board, reports Wales Online. The airline allegedly told her: Even if I did fly, Greek immigration would refuse me entry with a damaged passport and send me back to the UK, something it said would result in a fine for the airline. We tried to salvage our family holiday by getting emergency travel documents or an appointment for a fast-track passport. But emergency documents are only available if you are outside the UK, and even with a fast-track application it would have taken around 10 days for a new passport to arrive. So we took the painful decision to simply cancel and go home. Making things worse, Emily says the family had two travel insurance policies, but she claims both insurers refused to pay out for passport damage. Emily added: Our hotel in Corfu refused our request to move our booking to another date, and demanded we pay 90 per cent of our full balance due to our last-minute cancellation. They have now reduced this to 50 per cent, which I have agreed to pay. We paid for the flights using Avios points, but all-in-all we have lost 4,000. Emily claims that in response to her raising concerns that the check-in machine could do damage to other passports, BA said: It is the customer's responsibility to make sure they have all the documents they need. A spokesperson for British Airways told The Mirror: Tens of thousands of people use the self-service check-in machines without issue, so this is an extremely rare situation. Airlines are legally required to ensure any travel documents presented are valid, therefore ripped or damaged passports cannot be accepted. We understand our customer's frustration and will be in contact with them directly to discuss this further.

The train from Aberdeen to Glasgow derailed in 2020 killing three people. Train driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and passenger Christopher Stuchbury were killed when the train hit washed-out debris on the line near Carmount due to an incorrectly installed drainage system. Six other people were also injured in the derailment. Families of two people who died and five survivors have now been awarded nearly 1million in a settlement after civil actions were brought against Network Rail. Solicitors at Digby Brown confirmed their client's civil action against the rail company had been successfully settled outside of court. A spokesperson for the firm said: I can confirm our civil actions against Network Rail have been successfully settled. Specifics cannot be discussed however the total sum recovered was nearly 1million with all damages rightly reflecting the injuries, trauma and losses each person suffered, and will continue to suffer for the rest of their lives. No amount of compensation will ever heal the wounds of the horrendous and avoidable tragedy at Carmont but it can at least provide recognition to those affected and the means to look to the future in the most life-affirming way possible. Survivors of the derailment suffered serious injuries from broken bones, lacerations and permanent disfigurement. The company pled guilty to failing to ensure, so far as was reasonably practical, that railway workers not in its employment and members of the public travelling by train were not exposed to the risk of serious injury and death from train derailment as a result of failures in the construction, inspection and maintenance of drainage assets and in adverse and extreme weather planning. Charges also stated on August 12, 2020, Network Rail failed to implement an emergency speed restriction in absence of current information about the integrity of the railway line and drainage asses between Montrose and Stonehaven, and failed to inform the driver it was unsafe to drive the train at a speed of 75mph or caution him to reduce his speed. The court heard when the driver, Mr McCullough, pulled the emergency break down there was insufficient time to have any impact on the speed of the train. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) report published last March found errors in the construction of a drainage system installed by Carillion meant it was unable to cope with heavy rain which fell in the area on the morning of the crash. Carillion went into compulsory liquidation in January 2018. The RAIB report made 20 recommendations to improve railway safety, many of which were directed at Network Rail. Network Rail previously said it is determined to build upon the significant changes it has made since the incident, which have helped us to manage the risk of severe weather to the network, and it has invested millions to improve the resilience of the railway.

The defendants make numerous allegations regarding their access to classified discovery arising from the status of secure facilities, their clearances, and other considerations. Most of the allegations are inaccurate or incomplete; collectively they are misleading, Smith's office said in a court filing Monday, arguing the case should go to trial as scheduled in May of next year. The filing also says that prosecutors know the reason why Trump illegally held on to the large cache of national security information after he left the White House, and suggests some of the information was even more sensitive than prosecutors initially believed. That the classified materials at issue in this case were taken from the White House and retained at Mar-a-Lago is not in dispute; what is in dispute is how that occurred, why it occurred, what Trump knew, and what Trump intended in retaining them -- all issues that the Government will prove at trial primarily with unclassified evidence, the filing said, without elaborating. Whether the highly classified documents Trump retained at Mar-a-Lago contain national defense information is a fact Trump can try to dispute, but it will hardly be the centerpiece of the trial, it added. The government made the assertions while pushing back against Trump's attorneys' claims they needed to delay the trial because they have not yet reviewed the most sensitive documents in the case, which require security clearances and a secure location to review them in. Prosecutors said Trump's attorneys already have access to the vast majority of documents in the case, but there is a small subset of the documents that are so sensitive they cannot be held in a regular SCIF -- a court-approved sensitive compartmented information facility -- and require enhanced security protocols for their transport, review, discussion, and storage. The special measures documents constitute a tiny subset of the total array of classified documents involved, which is itself a small subset of the total discovery produced, Smith's filing said, before revealing there had only recently been some new additions to that subset of documents, still constituting a small fraction of the overall discovery. The filing does not say how, when or why the classification was heightened. Peter Carr, a spokesperson for the special counsel's office, declined comment on the filing. Prosecutors acknowledged that enhanced security protocols have raised additional obstacles to full access to those materials for the defense, but said the Classified Information Security Officer (CISO) has advised the Government that he expects even those materials to be available for review and discussion by cleared counsel this week. Prosecutors said the government is working on establishing a site in Florida that is secure enough to store the documents, and in the meantime, with appropriate notice, those documents can be couriered by qualified control officers from the Intelligence Community to a SCIF in south Florida for defense inspection. In their filing, Trump's attorneys complained that the former president had not yet been able to review the documents in the case himself, but Smith's filing suggested that argument is a straw man. They said they are not aware of any request by Trump to personally appear to inspect any documents -- a request upon which the necessary arrangements to do so can and will be made. And whatever delay there has been to date in Trump's personal review of the classified materials, the seven months that remain before trial is more than ample time for him to do so. An attorney for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has said he considered the documents his, while also suggesting he planned on eventually turning them over to the National Archives. The Archives has said it requested the return of the documents for over a year and the Justice Department has said a Trump attorney certified last year that all documents with classified markings had been returned. An FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club later turned up over 100 classified documents, as well as thousands of other documents belonging to the government. Trump's attorneys last week filed their motion asking to delay the trial until after the election when they also sought to dismiss the Manhattan district attorney's hush money-related case against him and unsuccessfully sought to delay his ongoing 250 million civil fraud trial. He also contended Smith's other pending case against him in federal court in Washington for interfering with the election should be dismissed on the grounds of presidential immunity and dropped his 500 million lawsuit against his former attorney Michael Cohen. Trump had been scheduled to be deposed in that case Monday. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the four criminal cases against him and the civil fraud case, contending they are all politically motivated witch hunts.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Former President Donald Trump is accused of mishandling classified information.

He held a press conference on Monday to discuss the conflict, convening it first outside the speaker's office before moving to another room in the Capitol. He held a phone call with the speaker of the Knesset, the Israeli legislative body. He offered a five-point plan to help Israel, offered criticism of the administration, and called for further American action. But stripped of his power, McCarthy lacks the ability to do anything and his attempt to try to fill the void may do little more than draw attention to the fact that a chamber of the YOU.S. Congress remains leaderless as the world grapples with a new crisis. On Monday morning, McCarthy held a 35-minute news conference on the bloody conflict, saying that Hamas militants who carried out the surprise attack were emboldened by the Biden administration's policy of appeasement toward Iran. President Biden's No. 1 priority right now must be finding out how many Americans have been taken hostage and get them home. ... This administration must also make clear that harming any American will result in the wrath of the United States, McCarthy told reporters. We cannot repeat what happened in Afghanistan. It must be clear that we do not negotiate with terrorists and no American will be left behind. He continued: Biden's policy on appeasement, including money for hostage deals must come to an end. His policy has only emboldened terrorists and handing over 6 billion to Iran only helps the because. The former speaker appeared on Fox News over the weekend, warning how the vacancy has threatened the national security of the YOU.S. and Israel. McCarthy called his former counterpart, the speaker of the Israel Knesset, to reiterate American solidarity with one of its closest allies. His call to rescue American hostages is part of what McCarthy described as his five-point plan for Israel. In expelling McCarthy from the speaker's office last week, his political foes also removed one of Israel's foremost allies in Congress. McCarthy leads a bipartisan congressional delegation to Israel every two years, including earlier this year as speaker of the House. He is close to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he invited Israeli President Isaac Herzog to address a joint meeting of the YOU.S. Congress in July. On Monday, McCarthy recounted his phone call over the weekend with the Knesset speaker, Amir Ohana, who earlier this year had invited the YOU.S. speaker to address Israel's legislature. I called the speaker, Ohana. We are close. I thought, to me, it felt a lot like 911 in my life. He said, 'No, it is more like Pearl Harbor, McCarthy recalled. I called other friends who I have known quite some time that I visit in Israel, and they visit here... They said please tell Americans that this will not be over in a short endeavor. That this is something that they have never seen -- the amount of deaths, that were slaughtered, like the Holocaust. Pressed several times about whether he is open to being elected House speaker again given the new war raging in the Middle East, McCarthy would not rule out the possibility. That is a decision by the conference. I will allow the conference to make whatever decision, McCarthy said. Whether I am speaker or not, I am a member of this body. I know what history has had and I can lead in any position it is and right now, I realize we need these five actions taken now and stop delay.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Kevin McCarthy held a press conference on Monday to discuss the Israel-Hamas war.

Jabin Botsford  The Washington Post via Getty Images Former President Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden for this weekend's Hamas assault on Israel during Monday remarks to a crowd in the resort town of Wolfeboro, N.H. The war, in which Israel is now laying siege to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, happened for three reasons Trump said: Iran reaping oil revenue from relaxed sanctions enforcement, our country's perceived weakness during Biden's term and the YOU.S. freeing up 6 billion in Iranian funds for humanitarian efforts as part of a prisoner swap. Saying that Biden is laughed at all over the world, Trump pointed to his own sanctions enforcement and unilateral withdrawal from the multi-nation Iran nuclear deal as evidence that he would be tougher on Iran if Americans elect him instead of Biden in 2024. At the same time, he portrayed Biden and his administration as being out of touch, noting that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said less than two weeks ago that the Middle East is quieter today than it has been in two decades. Biden administration officials and Democrats have said that Iran accelerated its development of a nuclear weapon after Trump withdrew the YOU.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump's imposition of sanctions also failed to curb Iran's development of its nuclear capability. And that none of the 6 billion in funds, which are payments for oil purchases that belong to Iran, have been released. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a national co-chair of Biden's re-election campaign pushed back on Trump. With each and every lie, Donald Trump further proves he is too dangerous to lead the United States on the world stage, Duckworth, who is a veteran and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement released by the campaign. The generals and other military leaders who served under Trump -- those in a position to know -- have repeatedly said he made our country less safe, not more, she said. Day in and day out, he continuously disrespects the Veterans and servicemembers who committed their lives to protecting our fellow Americans, and we should not take his disgusting and transparently self serving comments as anything more than what they are: lies. The favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump's rhetoric aligns with that of most of the GOP candidates for president, who have been quick to lay responsibility at Biden's feet. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Fox News this weekend that the war presents a great opportunity for GOP candidates to draw a contrast with Biden. The multi-pronged attack was carried out primarily by Hamas, a group that the YOU.S. has designated a terrorist organization which gained control of the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip after winning elections there in 2006. Hamas is a longtime recipient of support from Iran, and former YOU.S. officials say the attack bears hallmarks of an Iranian-backed mission. The Biden administration condemned the attack, maintains sanctions against Hamas and has promised to provide aid to Israel. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Pentagon is moving an aircraft carrier strike group and warplanes closer to Israel to show support for the American ally. YOU.S. officials told NBC News on Monday that the deployment of those forces was also intended to send an explicit message to Iran to stand down -- specifically when it comes to any considerations by Tehran of unleashing the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah against norther Israel. During his remarks Monday, Trump repeatedly portrayed Biden as the central actor in a crooked family criminal enterprise -- despite a lack of evidence that Biden has committed any crime -- and, conversely, as mentally incapacitated, dumb as a rock and a puppet of former President Barack Obama. Emphasizing Obama's middle name, Trump said the problems underlying the war in Israel were caused in my opinion by his boss, Barack HUSSEIN Obama. Both in his speech and on his Truth Social account, Trump wondered about the possibility that terrorist attacks could be launched on YOU.S. soil. The same people that raided Israel are pouring into our once beautiful USA, through our TOTALLY OPEN SOUTHERN BORDER, at Record Numbers, he wrote. Are they planning an attack within our Country? Crooked Joe Biden and his BOSS, Barack Hussein Obama, did this to us! A senior YOU.S. official who is familiar with this area said this claim was false. While the exact number of people crossing the YOU.S. southern border who may have ties to Hamas remains classified, the official said the idea that Hamas is pouring across the border or has increased in numbers recently is demonstrably false. Trump made little secret of his broader disdain for Biden, accusing the president again -- without evidence -- of marshaling prosecutions against him. Trump, who faces four separate trials in federal and state courts, said explicitly that his situation would justify him using the power of the presidency to go after political adversaries.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Former President Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden for this weekend's Hamas assault on Israel. The war, in which Israel is now laying siege to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, happened for three reasons. Iran reaping oil revenue from relaxed sanctions enforcement, our country's perceived weakness during Biden's term and the YOU. freeing up 6 billion in Iranian funds for humanitarian efforts as part of a prisoner swap. Trump pointed to his own sanctions enforcement and unilateral withdrawal from the multi-nation Iran nuclear deal as evidence that he would be tougher on Iran if Americans elect him instead of Biden in 2024."

Aisha Wahab at a news conference in Sacramento in March for a proposed bill to add caste as a protected category in the state's anti-discrimination laws.Jos Luis Villegas  AP A bill that would have made California the first state to explicitly ban caste-based discrimination was vetoed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom. After a year of advocacy and a monthlong hunger strike, progressive South Asian groups were disappointed -- but said that the caste equity movement is just beginning. We are very proud of the power and resilience that caste-oppressed people across the state have shown in their advocacy for SB403, Thenmozhi Soundararajan, a caste equity activist and founder of the civil rights organization Equality Labs, said in a press release. While it is heartbreaking to receive the Governor's veto, it is not a reflection of the incredible democratic power that our communities showed. We did the impossible. Senate Bill 403, introduced in March by Democratic state Sen. Aisha Wahab, would have delineated caste as being protected under the existing category of ancestry in the state's civil rights law. It sparked dialogue in South Asian communities about the lingering effects of the caste system and how they present in American life. Many who identify as caste-oppressed went public with their stories in the process of moving the bill forward, saying they have faced violence, harassment and exclusion, particularly in the workplace. In a veto message, Newsom noted that California already bans discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation. When interpreted broadly, he said, this implicitly includes caste. Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary, his message said. Wahab's office did not respond to a request for comment on the veto. In March, Wahab told NBC News: This is a human rights bill. ... This is a bill that will allow people to pursue their American dream to the fullest potential without any restrictions based on where they come from, how they look or how they were treated somewhere else. Many in civil rights spaces said SB403 would have given Americans born into caste-oppressed groups a channel to fight discrimination legally, but other South Asian groups said the bill was racist, promoted falsehoods about Hinduism and put a target on the backs of Indian Americans. With the stroke of his pen, Governor Newsom has averted a civil rights and constitutional disaster that would have put a target on hundreds of thousands of Californians simply because of their ethnicity or their religious identity, as well as create a slippery slope of facially discriminatory laws, Samir Kalra, managing director of the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), said in a press release. They celebrated the bill's veto, saying the mention of caste in YOU.S. law was never needed. We at HAF have always said that any discrimination on the basis of 'caste' violates not only Hindu teachings, but also existing state and federal law, Suhag Shukla, the foundation's executive director, said in the release. We hope to move forward without hatred or malice to bring together our community which SB-403 so unnecessarily divided. As the caste equity movement continues to grow, Fresno, California, has become the second YOU.S. city, after Seattle, to officially add it to its discrimination law. Advocates say that, though SB403 was vetoed, how far it progressed signals change. The introduction of SB-403 represents the shifting tide in California to understand caste-based discrimination, activist Nirmal Singh, one of the hunger strikers, said in a press release. The fact that caste-oppressed people were given a platform to stand up for our basic human rights is a huge win in and of itself.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Senate Bill 403 would have made California the first state to explicitly ban caste-based discrimination.

The news was first reported by the Daily Caller and local outlets including the Texas Tribune. Paxton reportedly plans to file criminal complaints in each of the House impeachment manager's eight home counties, citing a new anti-doxxing law that makes it illegal to release or leak personal information with the intent to harm them. Paxon's office did not return a request for comment, though he shared the Daily Caller's tweet about the complaints on his X social media feed Monday. Paxton was impeached this spring over allegations of corruption and abuse of office; in September, he stood trial in the Senate, where he was acquitted on all charges in the court of impeachment.

The impeachment managers clearly have a desire to threaten me with harm when they released this information last week, Paxton said in a statement to the media, noting his family had received violent threats. The documents also made public emails between Paxton's contractor and Nate Paul, the campaign donor the House impeachment managers said bribed Paxton with home renovations. In the emails, Paxton's contractor shared updates and photos of the work being done on Paxton's home, with Paul, a real estate developer.

More than 1,000 people died after Hamas militants broke through the border fence that separates Israel from the blockaded Gaza Strip and began killing and kidnapping Israelis. At least 700 people were killed in Israel, according to the military, and more than 570 people in Gaza and the West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Around 100 people have been kidnapped.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is now expected to hold a hearing for the confirmation of Jack Lew, a former Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff during the Obama administration, as early as October 18, according to three people familiar with the plans. Biden nominated Lew more than a month ago. The Senate is not in session this week. But the White House officials said they hope lawmakers in both parties would agree with the president on the need to quickly confirm Lew amid the war between Israel and Hamas. Everyone understands the importance behind it, one White House official said. More than 1,200 people have been killed in the fighting so far, with at least 700 dead in Israel, according to the military, and more than 570 dead in Gaza and the West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Biden administration said Monday that nine Americans have been killed in the conflict and more are believed to be missing. Tom Nides, Biden's former ambassador to Israel, told NBC News in an interview that the Senate needs to confirm his successor immediately upon return. They need to get the committee hearing done. He needs to be on the ground. He will be a phenomenal ambassador and he needs to be there, Nides said. Ambassadors are always important. In crises, they are even more important. Some Democratic senators have said they agree. Now is not the time for politics. The Senate should confirm those awaiting votes the day we are back in session, and immediately schedule committee hearings to expedite confirmation of the remainder, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Sunday in a statement. Democrats and Republicans must work together to support our ally Israel. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., noted the YOU.S. is without an ambassador in multiple countries in the region and said partisan wrangling that leads to such vacancies sends a dangerous signal and encourages adventurism by our adversaries. The Senate should move the confirmation through the committee and the floor quickly, said Coons. The nominees for YOU.S. Ambassador to Oman, Kuwait and the State Department's Coordinator for Counterterrorism all await a vote on the Senate floor. The nominees for YOU.S. Ambassadors to Israel and Egypt, and the USAID Assistant Administrator for the Middle East await committee hearings. Beyond that, there has not been a confirmed top USAID official for the Middle East for nearly three years and no State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism for nearly two years now. Senate Republicans will have influence over how long it could take to confirm Lew, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, who has been holding up several Middle East nominations, has raised concerns about Lew specifically. Still, White House officials said they believe the Senate should be able to proceed more normally and work quickly on a hearing for Lew. The Senate is scheduled to return to Washington early next week. One official said Lew is eager to get to work, and the White House hopes he is confirmed with bipartisan support. Lew served as director of the Office of Management and Budget under former President Bill Clinton. In that position, he helped develop the memorandum of understanding at OMB on multi-year funding for Israel and worked to sustain it during the Obama administration and, on several occasions, per a White House official, Lew worked to provide crucial funding for Israeli missile defense systems to protect citizens from attacks. Lew also worked as the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources and played a key role in supporting Israel's effort to join the Organization for Economic Operation and Development, a White House official said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Senate Foreign Relations Committee expected to hold hearing for Jack Lew as early as October 18.

They were among the thousands attending the Supernova Music Festival in the early hours of Saturday when rockets were hurled toward Israel. A total of 260 people were killed at the event, according to a spokesperson for ZAKA, an Israeli nongovernmental rescue and recovery organization. New drone footage released by the first responders sheds light on the aftermath of the deadly attack, showing dozens of mangled cars strewn along the roads alongside the festival area. Some were upside down and others were charred beyond recognition, giving a snapshot of the violence that the concertgoers endured. Many tried to escape to their vehicles parked in the Negev desert but the road was soon blocked; videos taken later that morning and verified by NBC News showed the festival was directly ambushed by the militants. Many fled further into the desert, with videos showing some holding their breath behind bushes, hiding from militants who passed by, while some ran for their lives through the expansive wilderness. Paramedics like Yan Gorjalstan were inundated with emergency calls as the number of people injured piled up. At the time he had no idea that his friend of fifteen years, Noa Argamani, who was attending the rave, had been kidnapped by the militants. It was only when he returned home that he saw a video of her being taken away. As soon as I saw her, it was her 100, he said, adding Argamani loved partying and traveling. Until the weekend, Gorjalstan had never seen her without a smile, he said. But soon after getting the news of her kidnapping, he saw her in a video showing her in captivity in the Gaza Strip. The most terrifying thing is her voice and the horror look on her face, he said. You can see the horror of her saying, 'I do not want to die.' Noa's father, Shamale, was desperately hoping for her return over the weekend. I thought tomorrow will be a new day and she will be back, he said. Music festivals are common in Israel, drawing huge local and international crowds. They typically go on for multiple days and usually without a break. The festival, intended as an outlet for young partygoers to blow off steam, became one of the first targets for the militants. I have a lot of friends that they probably got kidnapped as well, and nobody knows about it because Noa is one of the only person that has the video and the confirmation that she is alive and held captive, Gorjalstan said.

Cena has said that his beef with Johnson was fueled by his anger over Johnson abandoning WWE in order to become an A-list Hollywood actor, which is exactly the career move Cena would later take himself. Cena admitted in May that he was short-sighted and selfish in feuding with Johnson, and now he told press that I 100 see and understand how people could consider him a hypocrite for calling out Johnson and then following in his footsteps. If you have been following what I have tried to do, especially as of late, publicly and personally to Dwayne Johnson, I have stated that although I thought I was trying to do what is best for business, Cena said about starting the feud. I went about it the wrong way. I violated his trust and I made allegations about his perspective that I knew nothing about. And deep down, I was a fan. I wanted The Rock back in WWE. I wanted to do anything to get The Rock back, but I did it the wrong way. Cena continued, I did not do it the respectful way, so I had to eat a little bit of crow. I had to say, 'I am sorry and I was wrong,' because I am sorry and I was wrong, and that is a very humbling experience. Dwayne is a hell of a guy... I became who I despised. I see that perspective and I understand it. It was a great learning experience from my mistake with feuding with The Rock. With his Hollywood career currently on pause because of the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, Cena decided to once again return to the world of WWE for the Fastlane event. Asked whether or not Hollywood plans to take him away from WWE once the strike is resolved, Cena answered, They do. They do. I made it perfectly clear you cannot do both because of the liability insurance, Cena explained. If I were trying to juggle both that is very selfish because I would put a whole lot of people in the movie business out of work if something happened to me. I stopped a project in the middle of the strike, and I cannot talk about it because of the strike we are in, he added. We are in the middle of it. As soon as we get back to work, we go back to work. I do not control any of that. I am crossing my fingers and hoping we can find a resolve that everyone is happy with. For right now, I think this is the best way I can help... by coming home to my family.

On Monday, in response to the large-scale deadly attacks by Hamas, Israel announced this blockade would become what they call a full-scale siege -- allowing no food, water, electricity and fuel to its 2.3 million residents, half of them children. Israel has also started intensively bombing Gaza. Laila el-Haddad, 45, an author and Palestinian rights activist who has lived in Gaza and is currently based near Baltimore, said the siege is tantamount to calling for the collective punishment of over 2 million citizens, describing it as morally repugnant and just frankly unbelievable. The Geneva Convention prohibits collective punishment. Civilians and aid workers say daily life is already dire -- and Israel's siege coupled with devastating airstrikes will make things even worse. As Palestinians, we always ask ourselves this question: How much worse can it get? el-Haddad said. We are seeing now that it can definitely get worse, she said. Israel announced the complete siege two days after it came under the surprise attack from Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza and is classified as a terrorist organization by dozens of countries, including the United States. More than 700 people in Israel have been killed, according to the military, while the Palestinian Health Ministry said more than 570 had been killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and the West Bank. No electricity, no food, no water, no gas -- it is all closed, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a video statement, adding that his military was fighting against human animals. In a telephone interview with NBC News, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Doron Spielman clarified that animals referred to Hamas fighters rather than the civilians being ruled by them in Gaza. However, he acknowledged, airstrikes, as well as cutting off basic supplies, could harm nonmilitants. Already, some 75,500 people are sheltering in 64 schools built by UNRWA, the YOU.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees said in a rolling update as of 1:30 p.m. ET Monday. Most of these schools are designated shelters, but 19 are not, and one of them has been hit in an airstrike, it said. We are at war with Hamas, with the knowledge that if we do not destroy them they seek to destroy us, Spielman said. Sadly, there may be innocents that may be hurt or killed. The Gaza Strip is a tiny, quotation mark-shaped spit of land twice the size of Washington, D.C., one of the most densely populated places in the world. Some 80 of its people are refugees, half are children. Meanwhile, less than 4 of its water is drinkable, and its unemployment rate of 46 is the worst in the world, according to UNICEF. Since 2007, when Hamas took control, it has been under a land, sea and air blockade by Israel, with which it shares a 32-mile border, and Egypt, which shares a 7-mile border to the south. Power lines from Israel provide most of Gaza's electricity. Everything it does generate itself comes via its only power plant that is fed with Israeli diesel. In addition, Israel heavily restricts any import materials it considers dual use -- covering building materials, agricultural equipment and medicine that Gazans say would be essential to rebuilding their lives. Israel does this because it says these goods and people could be used to assist Hamas' violent insurgency. A similar rationale has been given to the full-scale siege announced Monday. Meanwhile, the number of people allowed in and out has been reduced to a trickle, although last year Israel did grant 20,000 permits for Gazans to cross the border for work. I think nobody in sound mind would think that Israel should be supplying electricity and fuel to Gaza at this time, when it would simply be used by their savages to plan attacks on Israel, Spielman, the IDF spokesman, said, again clarifying savages referred to Hamas, rather than Gazans as a whole. Palestinians living in Gaza say they have no doubt this will deteriorate their already dire situation. How many days will the Gazans and international humanitarian organizations be able to bear the collapse of these services? asked Adnan Abu Hasna, who lives in the Gaza Strip and works as a media adviser with UNRWA. He and others were dismayed when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Gazans to leave areas that might house Hamas militants, warning his air force would turn them to rubble. There is literally nowhere to seek refuge because we are completely shut off from the outside world, el-Haddad said, which is why it was such a farcical comment. But for many people in Gaza, the material impoverishment is secondary to the emotional turmoil they feel themselves locked in. There is no tomorrow in Gaza, Hasna said. You cannot predict what is going to happen. You cannot dream.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israel announced a full-scale siege on Gaza, allowing no food, water, electricity and fuel to its 2.3 million residents.

Jessica Kourkounis  The New York Times via Redux file Workers at Mack Trucks have gone on strike Monday after rejecting a proposed contract between the company and the United Auto Workers union. The union released a letter on X, formerly known as Twitter, that said 73 of UAW members voted against the contract and would walk off the job at 7 a.m. ET. About 4,000 UAW members work at Mack Trucks in three states. UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in a letter addressed to the company that the two sides now need to settle issues include wage increase, cost of living allowances, job security, and pensions. We are surprised and disappointed that the UAW has chosen to strike, which we feel is unnecessary, said Mack President Stephen Roy in a press release. Mack Trucks says terms of that deal included a 10 wage increase in the first year and a compounded 20 increase to pay over the course of the five-year agreement, with a guarantee of no increases in health insurance premiums. Mack Trucks is owned by Volvo, so the new strike is separate from the UAW dispute with Detroit's Big Three. Since September 15, about 25,000 workers have walked off the job in an escalating series of strikes against Ford, General, Motors, and Stellantis, which makes cars under brands such as Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler. The rejected agreement between the union and Mack Trucks may be a record, but it also falls short of the terms the UAW and the Big Three have discussed. The union is seeking a 40 pay increase for those members, and says Ford, GM and Stellantis have all offered increases of around 20. In his statement, Roy suggested those kinds of increases were not realistic in the trucking industry.

On Friday, Russia lifted the ban on most of its diesel exports, two weeks after announcing export restrictions on diesel and gasoline to curb soaring domestic prices.

Analysts have said they do not expect a prolonged ban on diesel shipments, because of Russia's limited storage capacity which, once full, could force refiners to cut processing rates. On Monday, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that the easing of the diesel export ban was aimed at preventing storage capacity to overflow and crude processing rate cuts at domestic refiners.

Weather.com","This may sound similar to a doomsday sci-fi plot, but what if we told you this cataclysmic event might unfold in real life? NASA scientists have been keeping a close eye on Asteroid Bennu which is potentially on a collision course with our planet. And that is not even the most frightening part. If it does smash into Earth, it could unleash a mind-boggling 1,200 megatons of energy -- that is a whopping 24 times more powerful than the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created! But fret not, for the 1,600-foot-wide gigantic space rock has a long way to go before it finds the slim window to actually enter Earth's orbit. According to NASA's OSIRIS-REx scientist, this event will likely unfold towards the end of the 22nd century, possibly by September 24, 2182. Further, it is only possible if Bennu encounters the gravitational keyhole -- a crucial region in space that could redirect the asteroid towards Earth -- during its flyby. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Bennu is no stranger to our cosmic neighbourhood. In fact, it makes a close approach to Earth every six years, and in all its rendezvous with our planet since its initial discovery in 1999, we have escaped unscathed. Beyond its potential threat, Bennu holds the keys to unlocking many cosmic mysteries. It is a carbon-rich asteroid that is believed to have formed over 4.5 billion years ago, just a few million years into the solar system's formation. Recently, NASA's OSIRIS-REx dropped off pristine samples from Bennu on Earth, very ironically on September 24, 2023 -- exactly 159 years before its predicted impact date! Scientists think that this time capsule could offer us a glimpse into the solar system's early years, and it might even hold the organic molecules that could have ignited life on Earth.

His comments came even as the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas threatens to further strain ties that are already at their lowest point in decades. The bipartisan group of six senators, which is also traveling to YOU.S. allies South Korea and Japan, is the first congressional delegation to China since 2019. They met with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV. During their meeting, Schumer said he was disappointed by what he described as China's lack of sympathy for Israel after a surprise attack by fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas that was the deadliest incursion into Israeli territory in 50 years. On Sunday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged relevant parties to immediately cease hostilities to protect civilians. The fundamental way out of the conflict lies in implementing the two-state solution and establishing an independent State of Palestine, the ministry said in a statement that did not mention Hamas. Speaking to Xi on Monday, Schumer described the events in Israel as horrific. I urge you and the Chinese people to stand with the Israeli people and condemn these cowardly and vicious attacks, he said. I was very disappointed, to be honest, by the foreign ministry's statement that showed no sympathy or support for Israel during these troubled times, Schumer added. Schumer delivered the same statement earlier Monday to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who also attended the senators' meeting with Xi. Israel also criticized China's response, saying it expected to see a stronger condemnation of Hamas. Asked about Schumer's remarks on Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was deeply saddened by the civilian casualties and called for a cease-fire and negotiations, while reiterating support for a two-state solution. China is a common friend of Israel and Palestine, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. We sincerely hope to see Palestine and Israel co-existing peacefully and sharing security and development. Though Biden's focus is likely to shift to the Middle East, a recent diplomatic blitz has raised hopes for a thaw in relations between the world's two largest economies. The most likely setting for a Biden-Xi meeting would be next month in San Francisco, which is hosting the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The leaders last met in Indonesia last November at the annual summit of the Group of 20 economies, an event Xi did not attend this year when it was held in India. They have not spoken since, even as YOU.S.-China relations have spiraled over trade, technology, the status of Taiwan, China's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine and the appearance of an alleged Chinese spy balloon over YOU.S. territory early this year. Asked about a potential meeting with Xi, Biden told reporters on Friday that there has been no such meeting set up, but it is a possibility. The senators had expressed hope for their own meeting with Xi before their trip to Asia, which they said was aimed at advancing YOU.S. economic and national security interests in the region. During their trip, which began in Shanghai on Saturday, they are meeting with government and business leaders as well as executives from American companies. Schumer told Wang on Monday that while Washington does not seek conflict with Beijing, China should provide a level playing field to American companies operating in the country, which have raised concerns about tightening regulations and an unpredictable business environment. Wang urged Schumer to respect China's core interests and right to development. Beijing has objected to YOU.S. measures aimed at cutting it off from advanced semiconductor chips as well as restrictions Biden ordered in August on YOU.S. investment in some high-tech industries in China that are considered strategically sensitive. Though it was organized independently from the White House, the senators' trip received expressions of support from the Biden administration, which sent a series of senior officials to Beijing over the summer in an effort to improve relations. Senior YOU.S. officials, including members of Congress, would not typically meet with such a high-ranking Chinese figure as Xi. The Chinese president met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June but not other YOU.S. officials who made subsequent trips to Beijing, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, YOU.S. climate envoy John Kerry and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

Entire villages were flattened, bodies were trapped under collapsed houses and locals waited for help without even shovels to dig people out. Living and dead, victims were trapped under rubble, their faces grey with dust. A government spokesman said Sunday that hundreds were still trapped, more than 1,000 hurt and more than 1,300 homes destroyed. Most people were shocked ... some could not even talk. But there were others who could not stop crying and shouting, photographer Omid Haqjoo, who visited four villages Sunday, told The Associated Press by phone from Afghanistan's fourth largest city, Herat. (MORE: Tibet Avalanches Kill American Climber, Local Guide) Saturday's magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit a densely populated area near Herat. It was followed by strong aftershocks. A Taliban government spokesman on Sunday provided the toll that, if confirmed, would make it one of the deadliest earthquakes to strike the country in two decades. An earthquake that hit eastern Afghanistan in June 2022, striking a rugged, mountainous region, wiped out stone and mud-brick homes and killed at least 1,000 people. People in Herat freed a baby girl from a collapsed building after she was buried up to her neck in debris. A hand cradled the baby's torso as rescuers eased the child out of the ground. Rescuers said it was the baby's mother. It was not clear if the mother survived. The video was shared online and verified by The Associated Press. The YOU.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about 25 miles northwest of Herat. It was followed by three very strong aftershocks, measuring magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5, as well as lesser shocks. With much of the world wary of dealing directly with the Taliban government and focused on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Afghanistan has not received an immediate global response. Almost 36 hours after the first earthquake hit Herat province, there have been no planes of aid flying in, no specialists. Aid agencies and nongovernmental groups have appealed for the international community to come forward but only a handful of countries have publicly offered support, neighboring China and Pakistan among them. The International Rescue Committee warned that the lack of rescue equipment could push up the death toll in western Afghanistan because trapped survivors cannot be freed. There is not much disaster management capacity and what there is cannot cover people on the ground, said Salma Ben Aissa, the committee's country director for Afghanistan. The numbers (of dead) are increasing hour by hour. People injured in the quake on Saturday cannot get the treatment they need because of poor medical infrastructure so they are losing their lives. A lack of food, shelter and clean water are increasing the health risks among communities. The world rushed in aid after an earthquake rocked Syria and Turkey this year, killing tens of thousands of people. Abdul Wahid Rayan, a spokesman at the Ministry of Information and Culture, said Sunday that hundreds of civilians were buried under the debris in Herat, and he called for urgent help. At least a dozen teams have been scrambled to help with rescue efforts, including from the military and nonprofit organizations like the Red Crescent. The United Nations migration agency deployed four ambulances with doctors and psychosocial support counselors to the regional hospital. At least three mobile health teams were on their way to the Zenda Jan district, which is one of the worst-hit areas. Doctors Without Borders set up five medical tents at Herat Regional Hospital to accommodate up to 80 patients. Authorities have treated more than 300 patients, according to the agency. UNICEF dispatched thousands of supplies, including winter clothes, blankets and tarpaulins as temperatures dropped. Irfanullah Sharafzai, a spokesman for the Afghan Red Crescent Society, said seven teams were busy with rescue efforts while others were arriving from eight nearby provinces. They set up a temporary camp for the displaced, Sharafzai said. Some aid groups, like the World Food Program, were already on the scene with essential items. Later Sunday, people from surrounding villages brought equipment to support rescue efforts. The first quake was the strongest, causing the most damage and casualties, photographer Haqjoo said, quoting survivors. Save the Children said the scale of the damage was horrific. The numbers affected by this tragedy are truly disturbing - and those numbers will rise as people are still trapped in the rubble of their homes in Herat, said the aid group's country director for Afghanistan, Arshad Malik. This is a crisis on top of a crisis. Even before this disaster, children were suffering from a devastating lack of food. He called for an urgent injection of money from the international community. Neighboring Pakistan said it was in contact with Afghan authorities to get an assessment of the urgent needs. China's ambassador to Afghanistan, Zhao Xing, said his government and the country's charitable institutions were ready to provide all kinds of help. We are in contact with Afghan government aid agencies to provide aid to the needy, he said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Afghan cricket star Rashid Khan is donating all his Cricket World Cup fees to help Herat's earthquake survivors. Soon, we will be launching a fundraising campaign to call upon those who can support the people in need, he told his 1.9 million followers on X.

It is an unprecedented moment that adds urgency to an already challenging week for fractured House Republicans as they try to agree on who should succeed Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from power six days ago. The already tense internal GOP conflict grew more complicated over the weekend after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel that has killed more than 700 people, including at least nine Americans. Israel declared war against Hamas, launching strikes in Gaza that have killed hundreds more. House members are scheduled to return to work Tuesday afternoon. Because the House is currently operating with no elected speaker, the lower chamber is effectively paralyzed. The House cannot pass emergency military aid for Israel until lawmakers seat a new speaker. Additionally, Congress must pass a spending bill to avert a government shutdown by mid-November. And while the interim speaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., participated in an unclassified conference call on the Israel-Palestinian conflict on Sunday night, it is unclear whether he will be able to receive classified briefings in the Capitol this week. (President Joe Biden would need to grant McHenry that authority.) Given the House leadership void at this crucial moment, McCarthy, who is still a member of Congress, is assuming some roles of his old job. McCarthy plans to address reporters at 11 a.m. ET Monday, likely about Israel, in front of the speaker's office. He is already accused Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and other opponents of undermining the national security of the United States and Israel. There is nothing the House can do until they elect a speaker, and I do not know if that happens quickly, McCarthy said over the weekend on Fox News. The atrocities in Israel have sparked some Republican calls to reinstate McCarthy as speaker so the House can function. Removing McCarthy from office, mid-term, was idiotic. Doing so as Israel faces an all out attack is dangerous. Uncertainty and chaos in the YOU.S. breeds vulnerability around the world. The House should immediately reinstate McCarthy and stop screwing around, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who opposed the ouster, wrote on social media. It will be an arduous task for a divided and narrow majority. Republicans need 217 of their 221 members to agree on a new speaker in order to elect one, as they do not expect any Democratic support. It is unclear when the House will hold a floor vote to elect a new speaker. Two major candidates have stepped into the fray: Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the majority leader and No. 2 Republican, and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a right-wing firebrand and key Donald Trump ally who chairs the Judiciary Committee. The Senate, meanwhile, is out of session this week. But Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in light of the attack on Israel, the chamber will try to hold a classified briefing they can receive in their states as soon as possible so we can get additional details. In a statement Sunday night, Schumer said he urged the Biden administration and Defense Department to ensure Israel has everything it needs to protect itself, and reiterated that the Senate stands ready to deliver on additional needs.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Hamas attack on Israel has killed more than 700 people, including at least nine Americans.

Following days of torrential rain in the northeastern state of Sikkim, torrents of water swept down narrow river valleys from Lohnak Lake, in the northern part of the state, damaging a dam and wreaking destruction in villages and Rangpo town, about 50 km (30 miles) south of state capital Gangtok. Rescuers have found 25 bodies in the state and bodies of eight army personnel were found in the neighboring downstream state of West Bengal, Sikkim's chief secretary Vijay Bhushan Pathak told Reuters. He said 101 people were still missing in the latest of a series of natural disasters caused by extreme weather events in the Himalayas. Fourteen army personnel were among the missing, a defense ministry statement said. The search for survivors was hampered by damaged roads, poor communications and bad weather, and residents were struggling to clear sludge and debris in the wake of one of the worst disasters in the remote region in more than 50 years.

Sikkim, a Buddhist state of 650,000 people wedged in the mountains between Nepal, Bhutan and China, received 101 millimeters (four inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels. Lhonak Lake is a large glacial bullet-shaped water body that sits at the foot of a melting glacier. An analysis of the images shows more than 60 of the water held in the lake drained out after the extreme rainstorm triggered a glacial lake outburst. This phenomenon happens when a glacial lake rises too high or the surrounding land or ice gives way and the lake bursts, sending water and debris rushing down mountains. Scientists have long studied Lhonak Lake, identifying it as one of the fastest swelling glacial lakes in the region with a high risk for a potential glacial outburst, according to multiple studies.

Methamphetamine - known locally as shabu - is the most popular illegal drug in the Philippines. Under the rule of the previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, Philippine authorities waged an all-out war on the drug and its importers, killing an estimated 6,000-12,000 users and dealers. The vigilante campaign has subsided, but drug imports continue. On Friday, the Philippine Bureau of Customs (BOC) unveiled the seizure of 323 kilos of methamphetamine that had been captured at the Manila International Container Port. According to the BOC's head of intelligence, Juvymax Uy, the shipment may have arrived at the port as early as February. The consignment - described in the bill of lading as beef jerky - had been abandoned at the port, Uy said. The container itself was old enough that it still bore the markings of United Arab Shipping Compay (UASC), which was acquired and absorbed by Hapag Lloyd three years ago. The BOC is working to find out more about the identity of the consignee. The Philippine National Police was first to find the cargo in the container, and it alerted the BOC and the Philippine Coast Guard. An x-ray inspection of the jerky packages revealed that they contained a combination of jerky, gel, and aluminum foil, plus meth wrapped in carbon paper to avoid detection. There were a total of 1,000 packs of meth in the shipment weighing a total of 323 kilos.

What followed was chaos and destruction, the flooding of the Teesta affecting over 40,000 people in four districts of the Eastern Himalayan state. While many tourists and locals found themselves stranded in Mangan, Pakyong, Namchi and Gangtok districts, several others went missing. As of today, about 142 individuals, some of whom were soldiers, have been reported missing. But with more and more bodies getting washed away and being recovered from the debris downstream, hopes of finding survivors are dwindling. According to the Times of India, the death toll has risen to 82 after more bodies of army personnel washed ashore on Sunday. Of these, 33 casualties have been reported from various parts of Sikkim. But the number of bodies that washed up in the neighbouring state of West Bengal is much higher -- 49 of the people confirmed to be dead were discovered in Bengal's Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts. Jalpaiguri SP Khandbahale Umesh Ganpat told reporters that 39 bodies had been found in the district, ten of which had been identified and handed over to the authorities. Six of these were soldiers. Fortunately, on Sunday, water levels along the Teesta river finally returned to normal four days after the floods first hit, an official from Sikkim's state disaster control room confirmed. And over 2,500 people stranded in the floods had been rescued despite evacuation efforts made more complicated by the destroyed roads, bridges and telephone lines. Further, at least 160 students from Assam that were stranded in Sikkim were safely transported back to Guwahati on Sunday night. Amid rescue efforts by the Army's Trishakti Corps and NDRF teams, experts have been busy trying to understand the calamity better. Our planet's average surface temperature has risen by almost 1.2C since pre-industrial times, but high-mountain regions globally have warmed twice as fast.

The release of water from Lagdo Dam has long been a because for concern in Nigeria, as it results in the swelling of the Benue River, which traverses multiple Nigerian states, including Adamawa and Taraba in the northeast region, as well as Benue and Kogi in the central region. Ahmed said the recent release had already led to the displacement of local communities and could lead to further destruction of crops and other infrastructure. The NEMA has been alerted to the sudden increased inundation of riverine communities and farmlands along the banks of the Niger River in the past 48 hours, the emergency relief agency official said, citing a situation report that confirmed the upsurge of water along the flood plains of the Benue River. He said that crops, lands and valuable infrastructure are at risk of being washed away by the floodwaters, adding that the situation is expected to be witnessed in downstream southern states, including Anambra, Edo, Delta and Bayelsa, as the Benue and Niger rivers flow to the Atlantic Ocean through Nigeria's delta region. So far, a total of 28 people have been confirmed killed due to flooding in Africa's most populous country this year, with 159,157 others seriously affected, according to data from the NEMA.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank decided in 2018 to host their annual meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, bringing the affair to the African continent for the first time in 50 years. Their original timeline was delayed by the pandemic, but the meeting beginning Monday arrives at an apropos time. After a devastating earthquake last month killed nearly 3,000 and wreaked 11.7 billion (11.1 billion) in damages, both officials and civil society groups are eagerly anticipating discussions about how to promote economic resiliency in light of natural disaster. In no other area is the need for international cooperation as evident as in addressing the existential threat of climate change. The world has a responsibility to stand with vulnerable countries as they deal with shocks they have not caused, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director said in a speech on Thursday. Often lenders of last resort, the IMF and the World Bank use billions in loans and assistance to buoy struggling economies and encourage countries operating in deficit to implement reforms they say promote stability and growth. Still, they have been criticised for excluding the neediest nations from their governance and decision-making process, demanding painful spending cuts. It is a time of multiple crises, particularly for Arab and African countries who have been hit by various exogenous shocks not of their making, said Iskander Erzini Vernoit, the director of the Morocco-based Imal Initiative for Climate  Development. 'There is this massive financing gap on the order of trillions for developing countries and also the key question of how affordable the financing can be. Those shocks include the pandemic and rising energy and food costs spurred by the war in Ukraine. Those challenges are particularly pronounced in Africa, where many countries spend more on debt than health care and education combined. Critics say the terms of many loans offered force governments from Egypt to Zambia to choose between paying debt or implementing unpopular spending cuts. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the IMF approved a 1.3 billion loan to help strengthen its preparedness and resilience against natural disasters in Morocco -- a longtime borrower who has used loans and credit to weather economic downturns, including most recently when the pandemic hit tourism and exports particularly hard. The institution has pushed Morocco to balance its budget and continue raising interest rates. In mountain villages far from the city's swanky hotels, midrise apartments and billboards advertising new construction, roads remain unpaved, water can be scarce and jobs hard to come by. The earthquake, residents say, exacerbated disparities plaguing rural areas and compounded struggles facing already-impoverished communities. Signs of the country's rapid economic development will be on display in Marrakech, where streets have been swept and damaged landmarks. But laid-off miner Brahim Ait Brahim -- who lives in Anerni, a mountain village near the quake's epicenter -- said he is still waiting for emergency financial and housing assistance one month after his house was destroyed in the earthquake. That is Marrakech. It is the capital for tourism, Ait Brahim said, describing it as the face of Morocco.

Lau added that she was prepared to head back to work as the Observatory had issued prior notices on downgrading the typhoon warnings. A clerk, who only gave the surname Wong, said he did not leave home early to head to work as the MTR service had returned to normal. He said he had no complaints about the transport arrangements on Monday, but he felt that the No 9 warning signal, which came into force on Sunday with only 15 minutes prior notice, was sudden.

The fungus plays a major role in the ecosystem of the earth - but it can be dangerous in the home and costly to remove. Mould is usually found on animal or plant matter, building materials like wood and plasterboard, and furnishings like curtains, carpets and boxes. The NHS says the problem with mould is that it produces allergens, irritants and, sometimes, toxic substances. When these are inhaled or they get into the skin, it causes nasty symptoms. At first, these toxins may not because any harm at low levels. But if they are consistently in the air, it starts to cause side effects. So the key thing to do is try and ensure that you do not invite mould into your home. We spoke to Nancy Emery, cleaning expert at Tap Warehouse, to find out exactly how to keep your home mould-free this winter. Here are Nancy's seven ways to keep mould out of your home. Nancy said: Ventilation is absolutely paramount for preventing future mould growth in your bathroom and other rooms of your home as mould growth is encouraged by moist areas. If you have a built-in extractor fan in the bathroom, try and turn it on during your bath or shower and leave it on for at least 5-10 minutes afterwards. This will ensure that any excess moist air in the room is removed and help the room to dry much faster. Nancy recommends that if you do not have a bathroom fan installed, open a window and let all the moist air out of the room after you have finished in the bathroom. The same rule applies in rooms where you have got clothes drying on an airer. Sneaky leaks in the bathroom can be contributing to mould growth without you ever noticing. Nancy said: Always check the caulking around bath or shower edges and behind the toilet's waste pipe. If you see any signs of leaking or damp then it might be a good idea to invest in sealing the gaps to prevent future mould growth. A good plumber will have these common problems sorted in no time at all. It costs around 330 on average to get a leaking pipe repaired, according to Checkatrade. Leave it any longer and you good pay hundreds more if you need an emergency call out. A dirty bathroom can encourage the build-up of both bacteria and mould growth, according to Nancy. She said: Taking the time to give the bathroom a weekly clean can reduce the likelihood that you will ever have a mould problem. Make sure that you remove as much dust as you can as this is a food source for mould and will encourage growth, If like me, you are a bit lazy, then spraying a little vinegar around mould-prone areas will ensure that you never have a problem. You can buy vinegar sprays from all major supermarkets and the cheapest we have seen costs 85p at Tesco. Nancy also recommends looking out for mould-resistant products to use in kitchens and bathrooms. She said: There are plenty of preventative measures you can take when installing a new bathroom or kitchen or renovating an old one. Mould-resistant products, such as paint, grout and caulking, are becoming ever more popular on the market today. They may be a little pricier but can save you a lot of money in mould repair and removal bills. A 1 litre can of mould-resistant white paint would set you back 19.99 at Screwfix - just 3 more than the cheapest standard white emulsion at the same shop. If you have a shower curtain installed in your shower bath or shower, it can be a breeding ground for bacteria and mould. Nancy said: Make sure that you stretch out your shower curtain fully after bathing to ensure that it dries out completely each time. If it is looking a little dirty, running it through the washing machine is a really quick and easy way to get it gleaming once again. Just make sure to check the label on yours to find out what temperature to wash it at is best. Nancy said: Although you may not think you have enough time in the morning, using your squeegee after every shower is a really easy way to prevent mould build up on your shower screen and surrounding area. You can pick up a squeegee for as little as 5 online. Some retailers including Ikea also stock floor squeegees for 4.50 to help you keep your floors dry without hurting your back. Wet towels left on the floor are a perfect place for mould to grow. Nancy said: Not only is this unhygienic, it will also lead to an unpleasant musty smell. A heated towel rail will ensure your towels dry quickly before mould has a chance to develop. If you do not have one built into your central heating system you can buy them from a number of major high street stores including supermarkets. For example, Asda is selling a 42 heated towel rail right now and it costs just 5p per hour to run. Nancy said that bleach is all you need if you neither own nor want to buy specialised cleaning sprays and paints. If using bleach, mix four parts of water with one part bleach You will also need a stiff brush, a bucket of water with cloth, and another cloth for drying Apply your solution to the affected areas (including a few inches around visible mould to kill any mould not yet visible) Scrub it firmly with a strong brush Wait for as long as possible or until the mould completely disappears from sight and rinse the treated areas thoroughly. Pat dry the area and allow it to completely dry before moving any furniture or placing items in front of the area.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Mould is usually found on animal or plant matter, building materials like wood and plasterboard, and furnishings like curtains, carpets and boxes.

In reality, the nation's first major sporting event in the post-COVID era was marred by diplomatic tensions, slapdash officiating and a dearth of accountability by the organising bodies. Before its dazzling opening ceremony, the Games were overshadowed by a visa row that prevented three Indian athletes from competing. The martial artists were from a region of India contested by China, and India's sports minister cancelled a planned visit to the Games in protest. The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), which runs the multi-sport event, said it was looking into the issue but never offered another word about it. The Games' clumsy official slogan was Heart to Heart, Future but a more suitable one might have been: Let things slide. North Korea arrived in force for its first major sporting event since the 2018 Asian Games, having shut its doors to the world -- and international drug testers -- for years. Being non-compliant to the global anti-doping code, the reclusive nation's flag is banned at multisport events outside the Olympics but flew at Hangzhou with the backing of the OCA. About 12,400 athletes from 45 countries competed, a year later than scheduled because of COVID-19. World-class quality was sparse in much of the 40-sport programme but there were some stunning achievements, notably in the pool, where China's swimmers shone. Having been beaten by Japan for swimming medals at Jakarta, China won 28 of the 41 titles, continuing its resurgence after an impressive world championships in Fukuoka. Butterfly queen Zhang Yufei and breaststroke king Qin Haiyang combined for 11 golds, earning the Games' MVP awards. Teenager Pan Zhanle emerged as a threat for the Olympic 100 metres freestyle next year, swimming at world record pace in the 4x100m medley relay. Dominating in their traditional strengths of badminton, diving and table tennis, China topped the medal table for the 11th successive Games with 201 golds, outstripping their previous best of 199 at Guangzhou in 2010. Second-placed Japan had 52 golds and South Korea was third with 42. Big improvers India were thrilled to finish fourth with a national record 28 golds, and smashed their target of 100 medals overall. Breakdancers competed at the Games for the first time in a preview of the discipline's Paris Olympic debut. Esports' debut as a medal event proved a hit. Local fans flocked to see star South Korean gamer Lee Sang-hyeok, better known as Faker, in the League of Legends category. Rested from the final, Lee joined his teammates in winning gold and a coveted exemption from South Korea's compulsory military service. Paris St Germain midfielder Lee Kang-in can also skip military service, with South Korea beating Japan 2-1 in the men's soccer final. Qatari high jump great Mutaz Barshim cruised to a third Asian Games gold, but the athletics was marred by controversy and official blunders. An official suffered a broken leg and serious bleeding after being hit by a misthrown hammer. Olympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra won the javelin but had to re-take his first effort after a long and confusing hiatus, with officials having failed to record his mark. The women's 100m hurdles descended into farce when China's Wu Yanni had a clear false start only for officials to disqualify Indian rival Jyothi Yarraji. Eventual silver medallist Yarraji, who was a step behind Wu, protested and officials corrected their decision, but Wu was allowed to run under protest before finally being disqualified. The men's kabaddi final between India and Iran was halted for an hour over an officiating dispute that saw both teams stage sit-down protests. Afghanistan, however, had no recourse when their men's cricket final against India was abandoned because of rain. With no spare day allocated for the weather and no provision to share the medal, India were awarded the gold purely by virtue of their higher world ranking. North Korea were sore losers after falling 2-1 to Japan in the men's soccer quarter-finals. Security staff intervened after several of their players mobbed and manhandled the referee on field after the match ended. The Games' drug testers reported seven athletes had been banned for positive tests, including a Turkmenistan athlete who took silver in kurash, the central Asian wrestling event. Backed by the OCA and the IOC, women represented Afghanistan in cycling, volleyball and athletics, in defiance of the Taliban, which has halted women's sport in the country. Nowadays, they are looking for hope, said Afghan volleyballer Mursal Khedri of women athletes in the nation.

Police Major Deejay Domingo, chief of the BSA Police Station of the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group, said that they have doubled security in the airport to prevent untoward incidents. Tighter security was imposed after the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) placed all 42 commercial airports in the country on heightened security alert after its Air Traffic Service received a warning via electronic mail that aircraft from Manila bound to Puerto Princesa City, Mactan-Cebu, Bicol, and Davao International Airports are about to be set off by a bomb. Roel Aranzado, BSA manager, stressed that intelligence reports from the PNP-Aviation Security Group did not find a real-time threat to BSA.

(Majdi FathiTPS) Israel's first line of defense, a missile defense system developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is labeled the Iron Dome. It was first deployed in 2011, and has since rebuffed and destroyed rockets from Hamas militants and Palestinian forces. The Iron Dome is land-based and built to keep the citizens of Israel safe from barrages of rockets deployed most often from the Gaza Strip by Iranian-backed terrorists, Hamas. The system is capable of tackling missiles with ranges between 2.5 miles and about 43 miles. ISRAEL SUCCESSFULLY TESTS SEA-BASED MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM Israel's shield uses radar to track an incoming threat, like a missile or artillery she will, and relays the data and target coordinates to a missile firing unit. Interceptor Tamir missiles are fired at the enemy's projectile to eliminate the threat. In the past, the Iron Dome has been 90 effective in intercepting thousands of rockets fired from Hamas terrorists, according to Israeli officials. The defense system was integral to Israel's defense during conflict with Gaza in 2012 and 2014. In December 2020, Israel's defense ministry reported that they tested sea-based aerial defense systems over a span of a few weeks and all tests were successfully intercepted by Israel's multi-tier defense systems - the Iron Dome, Arrow and David's Sling. David's Sling, or Magic Wand is the secondary layer of protection and a complete air defense system also developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to combat ballistic missiles and medium-range rocket attacks. ISRAEL OFFICIALLY UNVEILS DAVID'S SLING MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM The Arrow is the third layer of protection and an anti-missile defense system - the most advanced of its kind. It is used to combat long-range missile strikes. The YOU.S. has invested in the Iron Dome, David's Sling and the Arrow and has provided finances for the restocking of the defense systems. In 2021, bipartisan House lawmakers doubled down on America's support for Israel following a deadly conflict with Hamas. The battle lasted 11 days in May 2021, and resulted in the deaths of 250 Palestinians and 10 Israelis. Both Democrats and Republicans wrote to now retired Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in June 2021 urging the Pentagon to work with Congress to restock Israel's supply of interceptors for the Iron Dome. A total of 55 lawmakers signed the letter in support. The letter read, We must ensure that the Iron Dome remains able to protect Israel without running the risk that its stockpile of interceptors becomes depleted. Israel must always have the resources it needs to defend itself from incoming rockets when it is targeted again. The United States began providing funding for the Iron Dome in 2011 and 55 of the system's components are currently manufactured in the YOU.S., according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Israel is the unrivaled recipient of YOU.S. military assistance, totaling over 3 billion each year. For the Iron Dome alone, the YOU.S. volunteered 1.6 billion for the Iron Dome from 2011-2021.

When there is fire, there will be smoke, and if there is wind it can get anywhere, the president, known as Jokowi, told reporters in Jakarta on Saturday. I have ordered the military chief and the police to handle every hotspot, however small, immediately. Singapore and Malaysia have complained about the spread of choking haze from the fires.

Haze is a recurring problem in Southeast Asia, disrupting tourism, causing severe respiratory illness and costing local economies billions of dollars. It mostly originates from natural or man-made fires in Indonesia and Malaysia during the dry season. Many of the blazes result from illegal burning to clear farmland for cash crops such as palm oil, a practice that persists despite years of government efforts to stamp it out. Fires are often the worst at the height of the dry season in August and September, but in El Nino years, rains are often delayed, allowing the burning to spread into October and beyond. Almost 3,000 hotspots were detected in Indonesia in mid-September, with Sumatra and the Indonesian part of Borneo island, called Kalimantan, accounting for more than two thirds, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. In this prolonged dry season, the heat is above normal, Jokowi said. Land and forest fires do not just happen in Indonesia but also in the US, Canada. Here we can still control it better. He said the situation is far different from the strong El Nino in 2015, when haze blanketed the region. During that season, about 2.6 million hectares burned and the haze lingered for weeks, causing more than 100,000 premature deaths, according to researchers at Harvard and Columbia universities. In the El Nino of 1997, almost twice as much land burned.

Prime Minister lisabeth Borne called an emergency meeting of ministers on Friday to tackle the bedbug crisis. The country's transport minister, Clement Beaune, will create a plan to monitor and disinfect and to try to ease what has been described as a national psychosis surrounding the issue. It is hell, these bedbugs, Beaune told reporters, while clarifying: There is no resurgence of cases. There were 37 cases were reported in the bus and Metro system and a dozen others on trains however those claims proved unfounded as did viral videos of the tiny creatures supposedly burrowing in the seat of a train. While the suspected spike in cases proved false, removing bedbugs can be problematic as they can remain dormant for extended periods of time and can stay alive for a year without a meal. Now, President Emmanuel Macron and the country's lawmakers want to propose bills to fight bedbugs.

The Balticconnector pipeline suffered a sharp drop in pressure, and work is ongoing to confirm the exact location and because of the outage in the coming days, the company said in a statement. If it appears that the unusual pressure drop observed in the morning of October 8 ... is due to a leak (that) caused damage to the pipe, repair work may take at least several months depending on nature of the damage, Gasgrid said. The valves of the pipeline have been shut to prevent more gas from escaping. The 77 km (48 miles) Balticconnector pipeline between Inkoo in Finland and Paldiski in Estonia crosses the Gulf of Finland, an arm of the Baltic Sea that stretches eastwards into Russian waters and ends at the port of St Petersburg. In 2022, the larger Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea between Russia and Germany were damaged by explosions that authorities have said were deliberate acts of sabotage. Sunday's drop in pressure was registered just before 2 a.m. local time (2300 GMT) by Gasgrid in Finland and Estonian gas transmission system operator Elering. Hourly data from Elering showed a sudden drop in pipeline pressure at 2300 GMT from 34.5 bar to around 12 bar and then a further decline one hour later to just 6 bar, suggesting the contents had leaked into the ocean. Unlike the blasts that destroyed Nord Stream, which were detected by earthquake measurement stations, there was no immediate sign of seismic activity near Balticconnect, according to data from Norway's Norsar and the University of Helsinki. The pipeline, which can export in either direction depending on where demand is greatest, was transporting a volume of around 30 gigawatt hours of gas per day from Finland to Estonia at the time of the incident, Gasgrid said earlier. Both Elering and Gasgrid said consumers in their respective countries continued to receive gas from other sources.

I felt close to fainting. Russell added he had never experienced anything like that before. Williams driver Logan Sergeant retired because he could not cope with conditions any longer. The team said he had later been cleared by the medical team on-site after suffering from intense dehydration during the race (having been) weakened by having flu-like symptoms earlier in the week. The American's team-mate Alex Albon was taken to the medical centre and treated for acute heat exposure. He, too, was assessed and cleared by the medical team. Aston Martin's Lance Stroll sought out an ambulance to receive treatment for dehydration and many drivers lay down in the garage of governing body the FIA after the race as they sought to recover.

The decision to limit stint lengths to just 18 laps because of safety concerns about the tyres exacerbated the situation as it meant drivers were pushing harder than usual. F1 grands prix have been generally defined by tyre management since Pirelli became the supplier in 2011. Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who won his third world title on Saturday and followed it up with victory in the grand prix, said: These kind of temperatures are just too extreme. When I saw the weather before I came here, I was not looking forward to it. It has nothing to do with more training; some of the guys struggling are extremely fit and probably fitter than me. The whole day you walk around (like you are) in the sauna and then in the night the humidity goes up. But there are a few places like that. Singapore is like a two-hour race and it is very warm and it is on the limit of what should be allowed. It was way too hot. McLaren's Lando Norris, who finished third behind team-mate Oscar Piastri, said: Today we probably found the limit. Sad we had to find it that way - some people ending up in the medical centre or passing out. A pretty dangerous thing. We are in a car that gets extremely hot, in a very physical race. On TV it probably does not look that physical but when you have people who end up retiring it is too much; for the speeds we are doing it is too dangerous. It is something we need to speak about because it should not have happened in the first place. Russell said: I felt ill during this race. It was insane how hot it was. It was like you were inside an oven. I sometimes train in saunas and you push your body to the limit and you get to a point where it is too hot and you are like, 'I want to get out.' That was the feeling from about lap 12. There were points when I thought I was going to faint. It was unbelievable. Ocon said: Lap 15-16, I was throwing up for two laps in the cockpit and I was like: 'It is going to be a long race.' Then I tried to remember the mental side is the strongest part of the body. I managed to get that under control. I was not expecting the race to be that hard. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc said: You cannot see as well. The reflexes are much slower; many things are happening in the body and it makes it more difficult to be precise at 200mph with the vision not as good as at the beginning. Leclerc was one of several drivers who expressed relief that the Qatar race has been scheduled for six weeks later next season, on 1 December. But he added: Even that I do not know if it is enough.

Ford to the Eastern Mediterranean in a show of support for the Israeli counterattack on militant group Hamas. USS Ford is on her first full overseas deployment, and she carries an air wing of FA-18 Super Hornet strike fighters. She is accompanied by the cruiser USS Normandy, along with the destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney and USS Roosevelt. The Defense Department is also relocating Air Force assets to the region, including A-10, F-16, F-15 and F-35 aircraft squadrons. Strengthening our joint force posture, in addition to the materiel support that we will rapidly provide to Israel, underscores the United States' ironclad support for the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli people, said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in a statement. The move follows Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement that Israel has declared war on Hamas, the YOU.S.-designated terrorist group that serves as the leading political party in Gaza. Hamas has a long history of targeting civilians, and on Saturday, it launched a surprise attack against multiple Israeli towns as far as 15 miles from Gaza's borders. Backed by rocket salvos, Hamas fighters attacked Israeli soldiers, opened fire on civilians and took as many as 100 hostages. According to Israeli rescue agencies, over 700 people were killed and 2,200 wounded in the initial attack. A lesser number were killed and wounded in Gaza during initial Israeli counterstrikes, the Palestinian health ministry claimed. The Israeli Navy said that one of its patrol ships thwarted dozens of Hamas fighters who were attempting to infiltrate into Israel's territory by sea in the early hours of Saturday morning. On Sunday, it also reported that it had captured the deputy commander of Hamas' seaborne operations, Muhammad Abu Ghali. A full-scale response is under way, and the Israeli Defense Forces has already delivered about 100 tons of munitions onto the Shuja'iyya neighborhood, a Hamas stronghold east of the city center. Other early targets included the Hamas-owned National Islamic Bank.

Tommy Tuberville will not lift his military blockade amid Israel-Hamas conflict,"WASHINGTON -- The office of Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he is not backing down on his monthslong blockade on hundreds of military promotions, even amid Hamas' deadly attack on Israel, a close YOU.S ally. The Pentagon clearly thinks forcing taxpayers to facilitate abortion is more important than confirming their top nominees without a vote. They could end this situation TODAY by dropping their illegal and immoral policy and get everyone confirmed rapidly, but they refuse, Tuberville spokesperson Steve Stafford said in a statement to NBC News. If the Biden administration wants their nominees confirmed then Senate Democrats can do what Coach just did in September and file a cloture petition to force a vote. The news was first reported by Politico. Hundreds have died amid the ongoing battle Hamas launched against Israel over the weekend, with Hamas fights having also taken hostage of a number of civilians and soldiers. The State Department is working to verify reports that Americans were killed and taken hostage, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on NBC News' Meet the Press. The Biden administration has stated its support for Israel. As the conflict stretched into Day 2, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Sunday that the YOU.S. military is moving an aircraft carrier strike group and military aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support, and will also supply Israel with munitions and other military supplies as soon as possible. Tuberville's military blockade has put a hold on at least 300 military nominees, including top officers that would command forces in the Middle East. The Republican senator said his effort is in protest of the Defense Department policy that gives time off and reimbursements for service members and their family members seekings abortions out of state. Democrats and the White House have condemned Tuberville's use of a procedural tactic to clog up the confirmation of military officials as a threat to the military's preparedness. He cannot actually block the Senate from processing any promotion, but his hold has dramatically slowed down a process that is typically done without a vote. Tuberville and some Republicans have argued that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., could call each of the hundreds of military nominees for individual votes -- a process that would take hundreds of hours of floor time for each nominee. The Senate last month employed that tactic to confirm its first military nominees in months -- Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. as the nation's top military officer, Gen. Randy George as Army Chief of Staff and Gen. Eric Smith as commandant of the YOU.S. Marine Corps. Brown's confirmation vote came four months after President Joe Biden nominated him to the post. Brown is set to succeed Army Gen. Mark Milley, whose term ends this month. To expedite the process and confirm the nominees en bloc, it would require unanimous consent from all 100 Senators -- something that will not exist unless and until Tuberville lifts his hold over the Defense Department's abortion policy. Another option the Senate could use to get around Tuberville's blockade, in theory, is to vote to change the rules and make a one-time exception. That would require two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes, and it is unclear whether this would happen. Schumer's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Sen.

As the war between Hamas and Israeli forces enters a second day and dominates the headlines, here are four other stories from around the world you may have missed: Death toll in India's Sikkim floods rises to 77 The death toll in floods that hit India's northeastern state of Sikkim has risen to 77, while over 100 others are missing. Violent torrents struck Sikkim on Wednesday after a high-altitude glacial lake suddenly burst. Police in Jalpaiguri district, situated in the neighbouring West Bengal state, said 48 bodies were recovered on Sunday, including of eight Indian army personnel stationed in Sikkim, a state on the remote frontiers of Nepal and China with a sizeable military presence. Thousands of people remain stranded in relief camps as bad weather delays airlift rescues. Along with destroying major infrastructure, the floods also damaged more than 1,200 houses, according to officials. Two killed by avalanche on Shishapangma in Tibet More than 50 climbers were climbing up the summit of Shishapangma in Tibet when an avalanche crashed into them, killing an American mountaineer and her Nepali guide, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. Two avalanches hit the slopes of Shishapangma, the world's 14th tallest peak, at elevations of 7,600 metres and 8,000 metres on Saturday, killing the American climber Anna Gutu and her Nepali guide Mingmar Sherpa. Another American climber, Gina Marie Rzucidlo, and her Nepali guide, Tenjen Sherpa, were missing, Xinhua said. Climbers from around the world were pushing up the summit in what is a popular month for mountaineering in the Himalayas with eased monsoon rains making the conditions more stable. California governor vetoes caste discrimination bill California was just about to become the first US state to explicitly outlaw caste-based discrimination - until Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill late on Saturday. Last month, California's senate passed a bill that added caste as a form of protected ancestry under state civil rights law, as well as education and housing codes. Newsom called the bill unnecessary since the state already prohibits discrimination based on various characteristics such as colour, ancestry and national origin. Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary, he said in a statement. The debate around the bill has divided the Indian American community, with rights and social justice groups backing it as the most significant victory in combatting casteism in America. Proponents of the bill launched a hunger strike in early September pushing for the law's passage. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs in South Asia. Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, the Oakland-based Dalit rights group that has been leading the movement to end caste discrimination in the US, said she still viewed the moment as a victory for caste-oppressed people who have organised and built amazing power and awareness on this issue. COP28 chief calls for better adaptation to climate change Sultan al-Jaber, the president-designate of COP28 to be held in the United Arab Emirates later this year, on Sunday said adaptation must be front and centre of the climate agenda. We live in a region of extreme heat, water scarcity and food insecurity. We are also suffering harsh climate impacts, from droughts to the devastating floods of Derna, Jaber said, speaking at the MENA Climate Week in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. To deliver for our region we must put adaptation front and centre of the climate agenda. Jaber also called on governments to abandon fantasies of hastily sideling existing energy infrastructure in pursuit of climate goals. We cannot unplug the energy system of today before we build the new system of tomorrow. It is simply not practical or possible, he said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Death toll in India floods rises to 77, while over 100 others are missing.

With the storm barrelling towards the city, moving to within 90km (56 miles) in the afternoon, the Observatory raised the No 8 warning at 12.40pm. Officials were given advanced warning of the decision though, meaning golf and racing were cancelled early on, while the Hong Kong Football Association waited until just after noon to confirm the days Premier League fixtures were off. At Hong Kong Golf Club, the announcement that the signal was being raised between noon and 2pm forced organisers to scrap the final round, sending Janet Lin Xiyu and Ko Jin-young into a play-off. Tied at 11 under after the first two days, the pair were left to battle it out on the 18th hole to decide the title, and it took two goes before Lin prevailed, holing a monster 40ft birdie putt to seal the victory after missing a simpler one for par to win on the first attempt. The Chinese golfer, who attracted a lot of support from local fans during her time in Fanling, added the ATS title to the Asian Games bronze she won last week, and said she was still a little in shock. I mean, everything happens for a reason, she said. I did not hole my putt in the first play-off hole. I told myself to stay patient. And then it was another good drive and a good close shot. And, you know, making that putt is pretty phenomenal. The 18th has seen its fair share of drama over the years, from Rory McIlroys bunker shot in 2011 to Taichi Khos winning putt earlier this year in the World City Championship, and Lin called it a great stage for a play-off. It means a lot, when you can capture a win in front of a field that includes the world number one and three, Lin said. It was a pretty good feeling and also this week, I got so much support from the local fans and I feel really grateful. This means a lot to me and will always hold a very special place in my heart. While Lin was able to win her maiden ATS title, there was no chance of racing taking place in Sha Tin, with the Jockey Club deciding that in the interest of public and equine safety, the Sha Tin race meeting scheduled today will be cancelled. It is the third consecutive season that has seen a meeting lost to weather and officials will be scouring the calendar for a place to fit a replacement fixture. Although there are few gaps in the schedule as a result of the season starting a week later than normal, for the second successive year, there is a small window between Christmas and New Years Eve which could potentially fit an added meeting at a stretch. In the Hong Kong Premier League, defending champions Kitchee were denied the opportunity to close the six-point gap on leaders Lee Man when their away match at HKU23 fell victim to the weather. The fixture between BECAUSE Rangers and Crownity North District, who have played only two league games since the season began seven weeks ago, was also cancelled. Round two of qualifying at the Hong Kong Tennis Open was postponed and rescheduled for 11am on Monday, with main draw matches set to begin from 3pm.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Typhoon Koinu wipes out Aramco Team Series final round in Fanling.

Candidates running for the GOP's 2024 nomination on Saturday pointed fingers at the Biden administration for Hamas' deadly attack against Israel. Several have insinuated, without evidence, that the attack is funded by the administration's prisoner exchange with Iran. The administration informed Congress last month that it issued a waiver to give Tehran access to 6 billion in Iranian oil revenue that YOU.S. sanctions had blocked, according to a State Department document sent to Congress and obtained by NBC News. Notably, Haley, who served as YOU.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, did not join most of her Republican 2024 rivals in explicitly blaming the Biden administration for Hamas' attack against Israel on Saturday. She did, however, directly criticize the Biden administration in an interview on Meet the Press on Sunday. Do you think it was irresponsible of your rivals to level that allegation without any evidence or proof? asked NBC News' Kristen Welker. I actually think it was irresponsible for Secretary Blinken to say that the 6 billion does not weigh in here, she said. I mean, let us be honest with the American people and understand that Hamas knows and Iran knows they are moving money around as we speak, because they know 6 billion is going to be released. That is the reality. Haley then claimed that during her time as YOU.S. ambassador to the YOU.N. she went to the International Atomic Energy Agency and heard that funds the Obama administration authorized for Iran were sent to militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. They go and spread terrorism every time they get 1, she said. It does not go to the Iranian people. It does go to terrorist attacks and Secretary Blinken, it is just wrong to imply that this money is not being moved around as we speak. In a separate interview earlier on Meet the Press, Blinken was asked whether Iran played a role in Hamas' attack on Israel, which came amid talks between the YOU.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel about a potential landmark agreement to normalize relations. We do not have anything that shows us that Iran was directly involved in this attack, in planning it or carrying out, but that is something we are looking at very carefully, he said. And we have got to see where the facts lead. However, Blinken did not reject the notion that the talks surrounding a potential deal to normalize relationships could have played a role in the ongoing attack: It is no surprise that those who are opposed to the talks, those who are opposed to Israel normalizing its relations with its neighbors and with countries beyond the region are: Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. Blinken's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Haley also warned that America should view Hamas' attack on Israel should as a wake up call, arguing that Iran could enter the YOU.S. through the southern border. She said: We have an open border. People are coming through. They are not being vetted. We do not need to wait for another 911. You also look at the fact that, Kristen, America is incredibly distracted and incredibly divided and when America's distracted the world is less safe, she added. And look at what happened to Israel. They waited for them to be distracted and that is when your enemies move in. America needs to wake up. The Biden administration has dismissed GOP criticism, rejecting their argument that YOU.S. taxpayers are funding the 6 billion in oil revenue that Iran regained access to recently. All of the money held in restricted accounts in Doha as part of the arrangement to secure the release of 5 Americans in September remains in Doha. Not a penny has been spent, tweeted Treasury undersecretary Brian Nelson. These restricted funds cannot go to Iran -- it can only be used for future humanitarian-related purposes. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and misleading. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also said that none of the funds has been spent thus far. I cannot comment on 2024 because of the Hatch Act. But I can clarify the facts: Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people, Watson wrote in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread. A senior administration official said, The ability to use these funds in Qatar will be tied directly to payment for bona fide humanitarian items -- food, agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices only -- requests vetted and approved by Qatari banks and their European correspondents, who are themselves committed to sanctions compliance. No funds go into Iran -- ever. These funds will be used solely to provide essential humanitarian support to the Iranian people, with payment to vetted third-party vendors.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Candidates running for the GOP's 2024 nomination on Saturday pointed fingers at the Biden administration for Hamas' deadly attack against Israel.

Dozens of river dolphins perished and washed up on shore. And thousands of lifeless fish float on the water's surface. These are just the first grim visions of extreme drought sweeping across Brazil's Amazon. The historically low water levels have affected hundreds of thousands of people and wildlife and, with experts predicting the drought could last until early 2024, the problems stand to intensify. Raimundo Silva do Carmo, 67, makes his living as a fisherman, but these days has been struggling to simply find water. Like most rural residents in Brazil's Amazon, do Carmo typically retrieves water untreated from the biome's abundant waterways. On Thursday morning, he was making his fourth trip of the day to fill a plastic bucket from a well dug into the cracked bed of Lake Puraquequara, just east of Amazonas state's capital Manaus. It is dreadful work, even more so when the sun is hot, do Carmo told The Associated Press. We use the water to drink, to bathe, to cook. Without water, there is no life. Joaquim Mendes da Silva, a 73-year-old ship carpenter who has lived by the same lake for 43 years, said this drought is the worst he can recall. Area children stopped going to school a month ago because getting there by river became impossible. Eight Brazilian states recorded the lowest rainfall in the period from July to September in over 40 years, according to CEMADEN, Brazil's disaster warning center. The drought has affected most of the main rivers in the Amazon, the world's largest basin, which accounts for 20 of the planet's fresh water. And as of Friday, 42 of 62 municipalities in Amazonas had declared a state of emergency. Some 250,000 people have been affected by the drought so far, and that number may double by year's end, according to the state's civil defense authority. In the Auati-Parana Extractive Reserve, about 450 miles west of Lake Puraquequara, over 300 riverine families are struggling to get food and other supplies. Only small canoes with reduced cargo can manage the trip to the closest city, and picking a route through shallow water has pushed travel time from nine hours to 14. Moreover, canals to the lakes where they fish for pirarucu, the Amazon's largest fish and their primary source of income, have dried up, and carrying fish that weigh as much as 200 kilograms (about 440 pounds) along trails would be extremely burdensome. We run the risk of catching fish in the lake, and it arrives spoiled. So there is no way for us to fish, said Edvaldo de Lira, the local association president. Dry spells are part of the Amazon's cyclical weather pattern, with lighter rainfall from May to October for most of the rainforest. That already low rainfall is being further reduced this year by two climate phenomena: El Nio -- the natural warming of surface waters in the Equatorial Pacific region -- and the warming of northern tropical Atlantic Ocean waters, said Ana Paula Cunha, a CEMADEN researcher. Global warming, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, is the backdrop of these intensified phenomena. Rising temperatures increase the likelihood of extreme weather, although attribution of specific events to climate change is complex and requires in-depth study. Still, as global temperatures continue to rise and the effects of climate change become more severe, the drought and its devastating consequences may be a glimpse into a bleak future, experts say. Average global temperatures soared to a record in September. Crushing heat waves have swept across large swathes of Brazil these past months, though it was winter. In its southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, devastating floods killed dozens. Droughts have become more frequent in the Amazon's Madeira River, whose basin extends some 2,000 miles from Bolivia to Brazil, with four of the five lowest river levels recorded in the past four years, said Marcus Suassuna Santos, a researcher with the Geological Survey of Brazil. The Madeira's level at Porto Velho is the lowest since measurements began in 1967. Nearby, Brazil's fourth-largest hydroelectric dam, Santo Antonio plant, halted operations this week due to the lack of water. It is the first time that happened since it opened in 2012. Further north, in the Negro River basin, a different pattern has emerged. The Amazon's main tributary has had seven of its largest floods in the past 11 years, with the worst in 2021. But the Negro River, too, is headed toward its lowest-ever water levels this year. We are already living a scenario of an altered climate that oscillates between extreme events, either of drought or heavy rains. This has very serious consequences not only for the environment, but also for people and the economy, said Ane Alencar, science director for the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, or IPAM, a nonprofit. I think there is a very high chance that what we are living now, the oscillation, is the new normal, Alencar added. Brazil's government has created a task force to coordinate a response. Ministers of President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva's government visited Manaus on Tuesday. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin promised food, drinking water and fuel to isolated communities, and said payments of the Bolsa Familia welfare program would be made in advance. Dredging on stretches of two rivers -- Solimoes and Madeira -- is in the works to improve navigability. Heat, along with the falling rivers, is suspected in the deaths of more than 140 dolphins in Lake Tefe, around 300 miles east of Manaus, rocketed into headlines in Brazil and beyond, along with images of vultures picking at their beached carcasses. Excessive heat may have caused organ failure, said Ayan Fleischmann, a hydrologist at the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Institute. Another hypothesis is bacteria, with abnormally warm waters acting as an additional stress factor. It is an unprecedented tragedy. Here in the region, no one had ever seen anything like it, said Fleischmann. It was a shock for everyone. Rainfall is forecast to be below average until the end of the year, according to the National Institute for Space Research. The drought's impact is already rippling beyond the Amazon's waterways, and into the rainforest. Areas of forest along the riverbanks accumulate a thick layer of leaf litter, which makes them particularly susceptible to wildfire, said Flvia Costa, a researcher at the National Institute of Amazonian Research. In Amazonas state, nearly 7,000 fires were reported in September alone, the second-highest figure for the month since satellite monitoring began in 1998. The resulting smoke is choking Manaus' more than 2 million inhabitants who are also experiencing sweltering heat. Last Sunday the city recorded its hottest temperature since regular measurements began in 1910. The increased frequency of extreme weather events heightens the need for coordination between the federal, regional and municipal governments to prepare and create a system of alerts to mitigate impacts.

More than 200 people were killed in Israel after Hamas fired thousands of missiles and sent gunmen through the security barrier into the country's south, officials said. Israeli forces said they were still fighting to regain control of eight areas of the country's territory from Hamas militants early Sunday. Retaliatory bombardment, including by Israeli fighter jets, killed at least 313 people in Gaza, the Palestinian health ministry said. Some 20 children were killed and nearly 2,000 injured, it added. Those death tolls were expected to rise significantly as Israel, stunned from a violent incursion of its territory not seen since the state's earliest days, took stock and vowed to take mighty vengeance. Netanyahu said that the enemy will pay a price it has never known before, warning Palestinians in Gaza to leave immediately. The 2.3 million residents of the tiny coastal enclave have long been blockaded and closed off by a security fence. Israel has now also begun cutting off energy supplies and the flow of goods to the densely populated strip of land. The Israeli response will be complicated by Hamas' capture of dozens of Israeli hostages, both civilian and military, which saw women and children among those taken to Gaza. Social media and Israeli TV was filled with accounts from devastated family members fearing for loved ones who had been seized by gunmen in their homes, amid fears they could be used as bargaining chips to trade for Palestinian prisoners or deter any Israeli ground assault. The attacks represent the most dangerous escalation in the conflict in decades and come almost exactly 50 years after the Arab-Israeli War in 1973, when Israel was similarly taken by surprise in a sudden attack by neighboring Egypt and Syria. Concerns of a broader conflict were fueled Sunday by flare-ups in the north, where Israel exchanged strikes across the Lebanon border with the Hezbollah militant group, and in Egypt where two Israelis and their guide were killed when an Egyptian citizen opened fire at a group of tourists in Alexandria, Israel's foreign ministry said. Israel appeared to be caught off guard once again by the coordinated attacks, raising questions about how vaunted intelligence agencies both there and in the United States failed to raise the alarm. Bracha Yarkoni, 75, watched as her home in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon took a direct hit from a rocket. Already woken on her birthday by the sound of explosions and the cries of her grandchildren, she watched from the street as the missile hit. God help us, she said. President Joe Biden joined world leaders in condemning the attack, declaring that his administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. The outbreak of intense fighting in the Middle East will test his foreign policy case for re-election in 2024. The situation will be made more volatile by Israel's nationalist government -- stung by presiding over such national trauma -- and the despair of Palestinians suffocated by the yearslong blockade of Gaza and Israeli occupation of the West Bank.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israeli forces are still fighting to regain control of eight areas of the country's territory, they say.

Israel has not yet said exactly how many people had been taken hostage during the unprecedented attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip, with the Israeli Embassy to the YOU.S. saying early Sunday that dozens had been kidnapped. Women, children and the elderly are believed to be among those taken, with some lists of missing people circulating online. NBC News has not verified those lists. Sometimes these are mothers with their children, sometimes these are people over 70 years old. They are taken into the Gaza strip and are basically held now underground by terrorists, Israeli author and senior newspaper columnist Nadav Eyal told NBC News by phone. A few Israelis luckily escaped kidnapping from their homes while hiding in basements. Israeli journalist Amir Tibon posted that his children had to keep silent while his family hunkered down for hours in the dark underground. In one widely circulated video, a young woman named Noa Argamani screams as she is being driven away on the back of a motorcycle while her boyfriend is overtaken by another group of men. In another video that appeared to be taken in Gaza, a man can be seen wielding a handgun while also holding a woman by her hair and shoving her into a vehicle. Both of those videos have been analyzed by NBC News and appear to be authentic. Israeli media reported that a number of young women were kidnapped from a music festival that was being held on the Gaza border, with a list of photos and names circulating on social media as the attacks unfolded. YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC News he was working to verify reports that Americans are among the hostages. We have reports that several Americans may be among the dead. We are very actively working to verify those reports, Blinken said. Similarly, we have seen reports about hostages and, there again, we are very actively trying to verify them and nail that down. Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan told NBC News by phone on Sunday that he and his team are checking the numbers and that they include a few Americans. The hostages immediately become a particularly sensitive part of what could be a drawn-out conflict. Any Israeli military strikes on Gaza will be much more complicated if hostages are being held there. Hostages have been a long-running part of the tensions between Israel and Hamas.

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., speaks to reporters outside a House Republican caucus meeting on Sept. 27.Anna Moneymaker  Getty Images The global crisis unfolding in Israel is putting renewed scrutiny on Congress, which has been without a permanent House speaker since Kevin McCarthy was ousted last week. Hamas on Saturday launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, leaving hundreds dead and escalating a decades-long conflict in the region. President Joe Biden on Saturday said that YOU.S. support for Israel is ironclad. But as an unelected Speaker Pro Tempore, McHenry is effectively powerless on the matter. Per House rules, the interim speaker can only act on matters that relate to the election of a new Speaker: gavel in, gavel out, and preside. This post-911 rule was designed for continuity of government, and not for an unprecedented political situation like the one we are in now. Two scholars with knowledge told NBC News the House would need to elect McHenry as Speaker Pro Tem for this to change. So, McHenry could not even pass a resolution condemning the attack? Exactly. Not unless the House votes to let him do it. There is even a question as to whether McHenry could call for a moment of silence on the House floor -- that is how limited his powers are believed to be. And what about emergency funding for Israel, or its Iron Dome? We have seen statements from relevant House and Senate lawmakers expressing willingness to propose legislation to this effect. But without a permanent House Speaker, the legislation cannot be brought to the House floor. And the Senate is out next week with no current plans to come back early. Ok, but can McHenry even get a classified briefing? He does have some level of security clearance because of his role as Chair of the Financial Services Committee. But this is different than the kind of classified intelligence the Gang of Eight typically receives. The Gang of Eight, briefed on classified intelligence matters by the executive branch, consists of leaders of each of the two parties from both the Senate and House, and the top lawmakers on both chambers' Intelligence committees. The President does have the power to grant McHenry Gang of 8 authority, per YOU.S. Code, and thus McHenry could, in theory, receive such a classified intelligence briefing. A senior administration official said yesterday that this is something the administration is actively discussing. It is a great question. It is actually something we were discussing today, because there probably is a role for Congress here and without a Speaker of the House, that is a unique situation we are going to have to work through, the official said.

Thousands of Israeli party-goers at a desert rave screamed and ran for their lives as bloodied victims collapsed around them. Family members searching for missing loved ones were shaken to recognise them in haunting social media videos showing Hamas militants taking terrified Israelis hostage. Israel was in shock Saturday, with the unprecedented scenes of violence and chaos unfolding across the country's south seared into people's minds. Even the steely-nerved residents of communities near the Gaza Strip who have grown used to the wail of air-raid sirens described Saturday's ground assault -- with fighters entering their communities in pick-up trucks, on boats and by hang-gliders -- as a nightmare come true. For Israelis working and living within range of Gaza, the sight of Hamas militants roaming outside their homes on Saturday -- and reports that Hamas had taken dozens of civilians and soldiers captive -- marked a terrifying turn of events unlike anything residents had experienced before. This was always the nightmare. We told ourselves that one day, the terrorists will come inside here, said Jehan Berman, a 42-year-old in the small community of Avshalom near Gaza. It took eight hours, he said, for the Israeli military to arrive at his kibbutz and start fending off the Hamas fighters. Berman, who suffers from multiple wounds and disabilities inflicted by the past four wars and countless other skirmishes between Israel and Hamas over the years, said Israeli authorities notified him that Hamas kidnapped his 75-year-old mother-in-law, along with several friends in their 30s and their small children. The last time he heard from his mother-in-law was 10:30 a.m., he said, when she called him, panicked and distraught, to say that Hamas militants had shot and killed her husband. While the Israeli military's Iron Dome anti-rocket defence system intercepted some 90 of Gaza rockets heading for populated areas, there was nothing protecting Israelis from armed militants opening fire and entering their homes. A fortified border fence, equipped with sophisticated sensors, proved no match for the heavy explosives unleashed by Hamas militants as they burst into Israel. This time, few residents had their usual sanguine slogans to offer about Israeli resilience and defiance. They were clearly rattled and emotional. I feel so incredibly violated, said 68-year-old Adele Raemer from a safe room in the southern kibbutz of Nir Am after discovering that Palestinian militants had smashed her windows while trying to break into her house. This is so tough for us, I do not even have the words, she said. Israel's Channel 12 aired a string of harrowing phone call recordings by civilians trapped inside their homes as militants closed in. The callers used hushed tones to describe terrifying scenes to their loved ones. We can hear them, they are breaking in through the windows and there is no one here to help us, one caller said. I love you, I love you A son whispered to his mother that he could hear gunshots. She pleaded with him to find somewhere secure to hide. Another caller told her relative she was not sure whether she would get out safely. I love you, I love you, she said. News of the surprise invasion, with its haunting echoes of the 1973 Mideast War, sent millions of Israelis rushing to bomb shelters. Some in hard-hit communities were evacuated to protected spaces farther north. Families who huddled in their basements had little idea what was unfolding above them but heard deeply disturbing sounds -- not just the usual shriek of rockets and muffled bangs of explosions, they said, but the loud crackling of gunfire that indicated fighters were on the ground, and getting closer. Naftali Bennett shows up for IDF reserve duty Amid the unprecedented scenario, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has shown up for reserve duty, the Jerusalem Post reported. Bennett, who served in office between June 2021 and June 2022, was pictured wearing an IDF military uniform. It comes after the IDF announced an extensive reserve recruitment due to the assault, which commenced on Saturday morning, reported The Jewish Chronicle. Sharing a photo purportedly showing the former PM in what appears to be a military warehouse, the newspaper Israel Hayom said Bennett was preparing to defend the country.

The attacks launched by Hamas fighters expose deficiencies in Israeli intelligence, experts said, while raising fresh questions about what the YOU.S. is getting in return for the time spent building surveillance capabilities and partnerships in the volatile Middle East. This is an enormous intelligence failure by the Israelis and the Americans, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and Middle East specialist. I do not see any reason to believe that either Washington or Jerusalem had any expectation this was coming. Follow live updates on Israel here. As a sitting president who pledged to restore competence in the foreign policy arena, Biden now faces accusations from political opponents that global trouble spots are multiplying on his watch. Polls show that Americans are turning against the Biden administration's arms deliveries to Ukraine in its grinding war with Russia. A YOU.S. Air Force general predicted in a memo in January that the YOU.S. and China could be at war by 2025. And a Biden administration initiative to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia is in danger of unraveling. If Israel's war with Hamas results in the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the Saudis may sour on the idea of improving ties to the Jewish state. The Biden administration has spent an enormous amount of effort to work on an Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement, Riedel said. That is probably dead in the water now. Once there are pictures of hundreds of Palestinian casualties -- including women and children -- the Saudi population is not going to be willing to accept a normalization agreement. Republican presidential candidates were quick to fault Biden after Hamas launched its attack. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump's campaign put out a statement focusing on the 6 billion in Iranian oil revenues that the YOU.S. had frozen through sanctions. Iran has historically funded Hamas, with whom Israel is now at war. In exchange for releasing the money, Iran agreed to let five imprisoned Americans return home. One month ago, President Trump warned that Joe Biden's weakness and 6 billion payout to Iran would 'be used for terrorism all over the Middle East,'  the Trump campaign statement said. That is exactly what is happening now. There is no evidence that the 6 billion helped finance the attacks. The money can be used only for medicine, food and humanitarian purposes under the conditions placed on its release, YOU.S. officials said. Yet in an interview with NBC News, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said his government would decide how it would spend the 6 billion. These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation, Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said in a social media post. Biden's approach to Iran figures to get more attention as the hostilities with Hamas unfold. He has faced demands from Arab countries and Israel to toughen his posture toward Iran as he tries to revive a nuclear deal reached when he was Barack Obama's vice president. In 2018, Trump pulled out of the deal, which was meant to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In a video released Saturday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another presidential candidate, said that Biden's policies have gone easy on Iran and helped fill their coffers. We are going to stand with Israel as they root out Hamas and we need to stand up to Iran, DeSantis said. Facing one of the most perilous foreign policy crises of his term, Biden spoke directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saturday morning. Later in the day, he gave a brief television address from the White House, saying that America's support for Israel is ironclad while warning Israel's enemies not to exploit these attacks. The world is watching, Biden said. David Rothkopf, a foreign policy analyst who was a senior trade official in the Clinton's administration, said in an interview: Everything that happens on a president's watch has the potential of lifting them up or becoming a problem. These are the kinds of things that have tested previous administrations and that they have faltered about. But so far, in this case, as in the past cases, the response from the Biden administration has been exactly what you would want. An open question is whether Biden will sustain the resolve he showed in his Saturday speech. Israel is poised for a fearsome counterattack. Its citizens may expect as much, amid images of Hamas fighters kidnapping Israeli citizens and spirting them back into Gaza. This is really something that Israel has not experienced, David Friedman, former YOU.S. ambassador to Israel in the Trump administration, said in an interview. Speaking from Jerusalem, Friedman said he had heard about 10 air raid sirens since the conflict started, forcing his family into a bomb shelter. I can just tell you, people are angry and they are hurt and they are feeling very fragile and exposed in ways they have not in decades. In past fights with Hamas, Israel has encountered international pressure to pull back. If civilian casualties mount this time in Gaza, progressive members of Congress may call on Biden to demand that Netanyahu stand down. The Biden administration ought to encourage Israel and support Israel to do what Israel thinks is necessary to restore deterrence and stability to its own country, Friedman said. There is going to be backlash against Israel. There is huge interest among many of Israel's enemies -- and, unfortunately, some of its friends -- in taking the view that Israel acts disproportionately. Another complication for Biden is a fraught relationship with Netanyahu that goes back years. Netanyahu opposed the Iran nuclear deal and praised Trump's bold decision when the ex-president withdrew from the agreement. He also gushed that Trump had made history by moving the YOU.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested Holy City of Jerusalem in 2018. Biden once insisted he and Netanyahu were buddies during a tense point in the Obama administration, but earlier this year, the friction between Biden and Netanyahu came to a head. Biden publicly opposed the prime minister's contentious judiciary overhaul, which would give more control of the supreme court to Netanyau and his religious and conservative allies. The move triggered massive protests in Israel and at the time, Biden spoke out. Like many strong supporters of Israel, I am very concerned. And I am concerned that they get this straight. They cannot continue down this road, Biden said in March. Biden added that he did not think he would be inviting Netanyahu to the White House in the near term. Now, with Israel facing a grave new military threat, Biden's job just got trickier: He must manage a delicate relationship with a wartime prime minister, help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion, and win a race against Republicans eager to paint his foreign policy as a failure. By his own reckoning, he is up to the task. Earlier this year, Biden had this to say about his bona fides: I am going to say something outrageous. I think I know as much about American foreign policy as anybody living, including Dr. Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state in the Nixon administration. That is what I have done my whole life -- for the last 270 years.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Hamas attacks expose deficiencies in Israeli intelligence, experts say.

After its members killed 200 Israelis and kidnapped dozens more, Hamas said it was taking revenge for a series of recent actions by Israel at Jerusalem's Al Asqa mosque and in the West Bank. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government has been conducting an escalating crackdown against what it says are rising Palestinian terror attacks for more than a year. Former YOU.S. intelligence and military officers said they believed the timing of the Hamas attack was primarily aimed at disrupting negotiations between Israel and Saudi Arabia as Riyadh appeared on the verge of a historic step to normalize relations with Israel. Iran is seeking to put pressure on their implacable foe Israel with this attack, said retired Navy admiral James Stavridis, the former commander of NATO. In an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt last month, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said, we are against any bilateral relations between our regional countries and the Zionist regime, a reference to Israel. Raisi added, We believe that the Zionist regime is intending to normalize this bilateral relations with the regional countries to create security for itself in the region. In recent weeks, diplomats from the YOU.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia have told NBC News that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and YOU.S. President Joe Biden have all expressed support for an agreement that would result in Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel diplomatically. Diplomats say that if Saudi Arabia agreed to recognize Israel it would lead other Arab states to do so. A series of such agreement would end decades of hostility between Israel and its neighbors dating back to 1948. All three sides, though, have complex conditions for such an agreement. Breaking with past Saudi rulers, bin Salman has signaled that he is willing to recognize Israel, given the vast economic benefits it would provide to Saudi Arabia. Before the Hamas attack, there were reports that Saudi Arabia had told the White House it would agree to increase its oil production to help cement a deal, something the Biden White House has sought for two years. But the Saudis want the YOU.S. to help them develop a civilian nuclear program, something opposed by hard-right members of Netanyahu's coalition and by members of the YOU.S. Senate, which would have to approve any such deal. Separately, President Biden told Prime Minister Netanyahu when they met in New York last month that any agreement would have to include land for the Palestinians so that they could establish a viable state, something Netanyahu's settlement extensions in the West Bank would prevent. Last week, a bipartisan group of Senators raised the same concerns in a letter to the White House.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,Hamas said it was taking revenge for a series of recent actions by Israel at Jerusalem's Al Asqa mosque and in the West Bank.

A cloudburst in South Lhonak lake on October 4 caused a devastating flood in Sikkim. The Army on Saturday said the flash floods in the hinterland of Sikkim are not affecting its operational preparedness along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the state and the formations responsible for the border management posture are maintaining a high state of readiness. While the hinterland of Sikkim has been affected, the operational situation along the LAC in Sikkim continues to be stable, the Army said. It said approximately 1,500 tourists are assessed to be stranded in the areas of Lachung and Lachen valleys in North Sikkim and efforts are on to rescue them. The Army suffered damage in the floods as some of its camps along the banks of the Teesta river were swept away. The formations responsible for the Border Management Posture are maintaining a high state of readiness and are optimally stocked as per the sustainable operational logistics plan, it said. The Army's assertion came on a day when the bodies of eight soldiers were found. The soldiers were part of a group of 22 Army personnel that went missing following the flash floods which were triggered by a cloudburst. A cloudburst in South Lhonak lake in North Sikkim on October 4 caused a devastating flood in Sikkim. The level of water in the Teesta increased by about 50-60 feet in height which caused calamitous floods downstream, the Army said, adding it was also affected as some of its camps along the river bank were either damaged or washed away. A vehicle parking area at Burdang near Singtam was affected by the flash flood and 23 soldiers and 39 vehicles that were taking an overnight transit halt have been submerged in silt or swept away, the Army said. At the site of the incident, silt and mud measuring up to 30-40 feet high have been deposited and most of the vehicles are buried underneath, it said. A massive search and rescue operation was immediately launched by the Indian Army, Border Roads Organisation, along with NDRF, state disaster relief teams, para military forces and civil administration. The Indian Army along with all agencies and Civil Administration continue their relentless search and rescue operations, while at the same time focusing on resuscitation of communication and other infrastructure in a well-coordinated manner, the Army said in a statement. The Army said it received reports of some ammunition, explosives and stores of the force being swept away from various camps and that 15 vehicles out of 39 that were missing have been recovered. Some ammunition, explosives and stores of the Indian Army from various camps swept away have been reported from various places along the downstream river banks, it said. The Indian Army has issued advisories through civil administration and deployed look out teams along with state police to warn the locals for reporting sighting of such items. Ammunition experts have been deployed to destroy the explosives recovered in a controlled manner, it said. The Army said the national highway 10 (NH 10), the lifeline of Sikkim, has been rendered unusable due to damage to the road surface and many bridges across the Teesta river were damaged. Alternate routes to Gangtok are available through East Sikkim and routes to West and South Sikkim are also available. However, in North Sikkim, roads beyond Mangan are currently cut off, it said. Eastern Army Commander Lt Gen RP Kalita along with Lt Gen VPS Kaushik, General-Officer Commanding of the Trishakti Corps, undertook an aerial survey on Friday to assess the extent of damage and plan for the relief efforts. According to estimates by the state government, a total of 142 people were missing, out of which 26 bodies have been recovered so far, the Army said. It said the exact assessment of the damage is yet to be corroborated due to the inclement weather and incessant rains. Out of the 26 bodies, eight have been positively identified as that of Indian Army soldiers, the Army said. It said approximately 1,500 tourists are assessed to be stranded in the areas of Lachung and Lachen valleys in North Sikkim.

The Hamas assault by air, land and sea also raised questions as to why YOU.S. intelligence agencies apparently did not see it coming, experts and former intelligence officials said. YOU.S. officials said that if the Israelis knew an attack was imminent they did not share it with Washington. We were not tracking this, one senior YOU.S. military official told NBC News. YOU.S. officials are discussing enhancing intelligence sharing with the Israelis to support the Israeli government in response to the Hamas attack, according to a YOU.S. official and a source familiar with the discussions. The additional intelligence to Israel could include information gathered from drones, eavesdropping and satellites but the officials did not elaborate. The onslaught took place a day after the 50th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and carried echoes of that conflict, when Israel was caught flat-footed by a coordinated offensive by its Arab neighbors, led by Egypt and Syria. This is Israel's 911. Not since 1973 has there been such a catastrophic intelligence failure in Israel, said Marc Polymeropoulous, who worked for the CIA for 26 years where he specialized in counterterrorism, the Middle East and South Asia. Israel's intelligence services have long been seen as some of the most capable in the world, with an array of human intelligence, eavesdropping and other technical means blanketing the West Bank and Gaza. It is almost inconceivable how they missed this, said Polymeropoulous. It was also unclear why YOU.S. intelligence agencies apparently did not see the attack coming as well as friendly Arab states such as Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, he said. I am stunned. But Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at The Soufan Center, a nonprofit that focuses on global security issues, said Israel had to bear the main responsibility for failing to anticipate Saturday's attack. Israel has exquisite, world-class intelligence collection and analysis capabilities and would have a far better picture of what is going on in its own backyard. This one falls squarely on the Israelis, he said. Clarke added it was an open question whether recent domestic political turmoil in Israel had possibly played a role in the apparent intelligence failure. David Friedman, former YOU.S. ambassador to Israel in the Trump administration, said, In the 40 or more years that I have been following Israel one way or another, I have never seen this happen. I have never seen the border breached in this manner. Usually, even one person from Gaza gets close to the border, they are intercepted and neutralized long before they can do anything. This is just something I have never seen before. It is of course a large intelligence failure. YOU.S. officials said early assessments are that the timing of the Hamas attack was related to signs that a deal normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel was close to being clinched. They also said that the 50-year anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war also may have been a factor. In the wake of the attack, both Hamas and Hezbollah said the attack represented a warning to any Muslim country seeking to strike peace with Israel. Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Hamad said on Al Jazeera television that the attack on Israel is absolutely a message to Muslim countries seeking normalization with Israel. He urged them to absolve themselves of this great shame. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that senior Israeli military officers and officials had assessed as recently as last week that Hamas wanted to avoid a full-blown conflict with Israel. NBC News could not immediately verify that report. I am truly astonished for something of this magnitude to go down and for the Israelis to have no clue that this is about to happen. I am just speechless, said Clarke of The Soufan Center. They have had sources inside these Palestinian groups for years, Clarke said. CIA Director William Burns was due to give a keynote speech Saturday at a national security conference in Georgia organized by the Cipher Brief media outlet but canceled due to the crisis in Israel, his spokesperson, Tammy Thorp said. For the moment, Israel -- and the United States -- were preoccupied with the immediate crisis but in time there will inevitably be demands for an inquiry as to how Israel could have been caught off guard by such an large-scale and sophisticated attack, experts said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Hamas assault by air, land and sea raises questions as to why YOU.S. intelligence agencies apparently did not see it coming, experts and former intelligence officials said.

In one instance, a widely circulated video of an Israeli airstrike was said to show a retaliation to Saturday's surprise attack by Palestinian group Hamas, which has left hundreds dead. BREAKING: Israeli Air Force is striking terror targets in Gaza, read the caption of the video, which was shared on Facebook and social media platform X. But the video was from airstrikes that happened in May, Reuters reported. In another, numerous users on X and TikTok shared a video that showed two jets being towed by ground. Some users claimed it showed Israeli Defense forces evacuating air bases near Gaza. One user said it showed Hamas forces towing Israeli jets. That video, however, was published last month, appearing on YouTube on Sept. 19, according to Reuters. The reposted version of the video had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times by Saturday afternoon. Many of the misleadingly labeled videos were shared by verified users on X, who are eligible for monetization of their content. Meanwhile, both fighting parties turned to social media and tech platforms to engage in information warfare. In dozens of posts on X, TikTok and Instagram, Israel's official social media accounts blasted Hamas and repeatedly stated, We are at war. In one video posted to Instagram and X, Israel compared Hamas to ISIS. Same ideology, different names, text placed over a video of an alleged kidnapping said. Hamas, which rules Gaza, has been categorized by the YOU.S. and the European Union as a militant terrorist group, and many social media companies, including the less tightly moderated X, have banned Hamas-affiliated accounts and politicians. The group instead has turned primarily to the messaging platform Telegram to distribute its content and saw colossal follower growth on Saturday. In the channel, Hamas posted polished promotional videos as well as on-the-ground footage from Saturday's violence. Others have since reposted the videos to other social media platforms. Among the footage circulating Saturday were videos of Israeli civilian hostages taken into Gaza. Others purport to show Hamas opening fire at Israeli attendees of a music festival. The images and videos that Hamas has released of innocent civilians are objectively horrifying. And while they may have released these videos in hopes of rallying other Palestinians to launch attacks, it is more likely to draw the international community to Israel's side, said Jonathan Lord, senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A widely circulated video of an Israeli airstrike was said to show a retaliation to Saturday's surprise attack by Palestinian group Hamas.

Several of them insisted, without evidence, that the YOU.S. funded these attacks by suggesting that 6 billion in oil revenue that the Biden administration recently unfroze as a result of a prisoner exchange with Iran, which has historically funded Hamas, was used to carry them out. These Hamas attacks are a disgrace and Israel has every right to defend itself with overwhelming force. Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden Administration, former President Donald Trump said in a statement. Trump, who has been leading the GOP primary pack, added that his administration brought so much peace to the Middle East through the Abraham Accords, only to see Biden whittle it away at a far more rapid pace than anyone thought possible. Here we go again. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is running for president, said in a statement, This is what happens when America's president projects weakness on the world stage, kowtows to the mullahs in Iran with a 6 Billion ransom, and leaders in the Republican Party signal American retreat as Leader of the Free World. Weakness arouses Evil. In remarks at the beginning of an event in Glenwood, Iowa on Saturday morning, Pence responded to the situation in Israel and blamed both Biden, but also Republicans, who he said are signaling retreat on the world stage. The Biden administration refuted the GOP criticism, saying that the 6 billion in oil revenue Iran regained access to recently did not come from YOU.S. taxpayer dollars. The ground truth is -- not a dollar of the 6 billion has been spent yet so that line of attack is just bad faith and wrong, a senior administration official said. The official said the money was not going directly to Iran and the agreement said that Iran could only use the money to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian items allowed by YOU.S. economic sanctions. These funds will be spent through individual humanitarian transactions, likely over a period of years, the official said. The ability to use these funds in Qatar will be tied directly to payment for bona fide humanitarian items -- food, agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices only -- requests vetted and approved by Qatari banks and their European correspondents, who are themselves committed to sanctions compliance. No funds go into Iran -- ever. These funds will be used solely to provide essential humanitarian support to the Iranian people, with payment to vetted third-party vendors. Officials said the money was not going directly to Iran and the agreement said that Iran could only use the money to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian items allowed by YOU.S. economic sanctions. Another presidential contender, Vivek Ramaswamy, said in a post on the social platform X, America's broken foreign policy establishment knew they were funding Hamas  went ahead with it anyway. The unprecedented 6BN in ransom paid to Iran last month worsened it: our taxpayer dollars are funding Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah. This will end on Day 1 of my administration. Despite the assurances from the White House about the limits Iran would have with the money, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said in an interview with NBC News in Tehran that his government would decide how it would spend the 6 billion. Qatar's central bank is overseeing the funds, which Iran can only use for humanitarian purposes, as allowed by YOU.S. sanctions, YOU.S. officials have said. But Raisi said in the interview that Iran would have authority over how the money would be spent. This money belongs to the Iranian people, the Iranian government, so the Islamic Republic of Iran will decide what to do with this money, he said, according to an Iranian government translator. Former Gov. Chris Christie, of New Jersey, was extremely critical of President Joe Biden, faulting him for not only Hamas' attacks on Israel but also Russia's attacks against Ukraine. Biden's appeasement of Israel's enemies has invited this war against Israel, Christie said in a post on X. Appeasement anywhere never works. We must do whatever it takes to support the State of Israel in its time of grave danger, and we must end the scourge of Iran-backed terrorism. This terrorism is funded by Biden's idiotic release of 6 billion to the Iranians. The Hamas war against Israel is now the second war started under Biden's failed presidency, first by Russia in Ukraine and now by Hamas in Israel, Christie added. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a similar post on X, Israel is now under attack by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists. Iran has helped fund this war against Israel and Joe Biden's policies that have gone easy on Iran have helped fill their coffers. We are going to stand with Israel as they root out Hamas and we need to stand up to Iran. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, another 2024 GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement that the attacks are an assault on Western Civilization. The truth is though, Joe Biden funded these attacks on Israel, Scott said. America's weakness is blood in the water for bad actors, but this is worse than that. We did not just invite this aggression, we paid for it. Iran is the biggest funder of Hamas. This is the Biden 6 billion ransom payment at work. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who served as YOU.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, was the only Republican who did not explicitly blame the Biden administration for the attacks. Hamas is a bloodthirsty terrorist organization backed by Iran and determined to kill as many innocent lives as possible. The reports out of Israel are horrific with a stunning number of dead and wounded and should be universally condemned. Israel has every right to defend its citizens from terror, she said in a statement. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said on X that the attacks are symbolic of the times we find ourselves in with weak leadership in the White House. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum wrote on X that Iran pays for the terrorism against Israel and blamed Biden. He said the YOU.S. must provide maximum support to our democratic ally.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Republican 2024 presidential candidates blamed the Biden administration for the attacks Hamas terrorists launched against Israel on Saturday.

The announcement and video verified by NBC News came hours after Hamas launched a deadly land, air and sea attack and fired a huge barrage of rockets at Israel. The military captives were being held in safe places and resistance tunnels, said Abu Ubaida, a spokesperson for Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades. Video also showed what appeared to be armed militants with rifles driving a pickup carrying several bloodied and bound-up men lying in the back. A spokesperson for the Israeli military confirmed to NBC News that Hamas took hostages and captives, but he did not say whether they were soldiers. The spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, added that there were hostage situations in the southern city of Ofakim and a nearby kibbutz called Beeri, where the video of the barefoot women appeared to have been filmed. There are special forces there with senior commanders and live fire fights are going on there, he said. He did not say whether the hostages were civilians or military personnel. Hagari said the military was fighting in 22 locations, adding there was no community in southern Israel where we do not have forces, in all the towns. He added that soldiers had died in the conflict. We do not have an exact number yet, we are at war, Hagari said. Gaza militants have rarely succeeded in taking Israeli soldiers hostage. In 2006, Hamas fighters seized Gilad Shalit and held him for five years. He was ultimately exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.

It is not really about the 46 pay raise, but the 2009 Obama deal that took away cost-of-living adjustments. It is not really about the short run, either. But let us see what the auto workers get in the face of President Biden's unrealistic demand that would force us to buy Chinese-battery-powered vehicles. The sheep will remain loyal - just as they are to every other radical idea - because to resist is to be uncool or, worse, deplatformed from woke society. But the irredeemable deplorables (who buck the system) are getting restless about an all-out plunge into the uncharted waters of EV world - a world dominated by China and its forced laborers in Xinjiang and Congolese child laborers. Funny how bedfellows make strange politics. The UAW bosses are all in with the EV mandate, but the rank and file just cheered an Orange man in a red elephant jacket. But if you think this is merely an American phenomenon, you would be wrong. This - this is the battle of the century, between those seeking to control all thought and action and those who only seek to control some (controversial) thought and action - a real-world game of thrones. Power, not progress, or even prosperity, is the goal. And, of course, big money. Every day the dangers of total reliance on electricity generation and transmission at a level twice that of today are exposed. And every day these warnings are ignored by the media and lampooned by the Karines of the world. In Pakistan, lightning hits a warehouse full of electric vehicles and batteries causing a fire and explosions that killed a 15-year-old boy and injured 163 others. Five electric vehicles were destroyed at Sydney's airport when a detached EV battery from a luxury vehicle burst into flames. Taxpayer-subsidized Proterra's bankruptcy has left the entire eight-vehicle Jackson (Wyoming) bus fleet grounded for months. Parts are not available. Naturally, Jackson's bureaucrats plan to buy more electric buses. Greenie points! British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a five-year delay on banning new gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles (till 2035), citing unacceptable costs on ordinary people. All across Europe the battle is raging over the transition. Unless net zero is modified, predictions are that the base car market will either vanish or will not be done by European manufacturers. Those ordinary people are speaking with their pocketbooks. Prices for used EVs have been slashed by nearly 25 as drivers lose confidence. Over half of British drivers deem EVs too expensive, and nearly half fear shortages of charging stations. British auto insurer John Lewis Financial Services has temporarily paused issuing polices on battery-powered vehicles until its underwriter analyses risks and costs (and raises rates). Another insurer, Aviva, reportedly is refusing to insure Teslas, while other EV owners saw premiums go up 1,000 in just one year (up to 4,000 more). Costs for EV repairs have risen sharply, and there is a shortage of technicians with the skills to carry out repairs - meaning EV owners may wait weeks with their toy in the shop. No wonder a J.D. Power survey reports 76 of new EV sales come from the luxury market - mainstream buyers cannot afford them. Nonetheless, the Association of British Insurers reassured the elites and deplatformers that, Our members fully support the roll-out of electric vehicles and efforts to transition to Net Zero. With the caveat that, Whether to offer insurance, and at what price, is a commercial decision for insurers based on their risk appetite. The rosy scenario (if tomorrow's EV sales match today's non-EV sales) predicts a loss of 117,000 automotive jobs to the transition. Thousands of jobs are already lost as automakers gear up to meet political demands - despite public resistance. These numbers, however, do not factor in the 75 reduction in private vehicle ownership demanded by Klaus Schwab and his fellow gazillionaire would-be gods. Nor do they factor in massive losses in petrochemical industry and other manufacturing jobs - at least 6,000 products use byproducts of gasoline and diesel production. Those industries, too, will be devastated by an end to fossil fuel production - and nobody in the power structure cares. Yes, horse-related jobs disappeared as automobiles replaced saddled animals on American roads. But such comparisons are political spin. American auto workers - like former American appliance and electronics workers -- watch production move to Mexico and China as our auto industry is crippled by regulations and mandates that make no economic or geopolitical sense. Despite the acquiescence by automakers to Biden's diktat (do any mainstream reporters still drive ICE vehicles?), there are signs of a burgeoning revolt, and not just from Trump-loving auto workers. The House just sent to the Senate the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, crafted by Rep. John Joyce (R, PA) to prevent governments from bans on ICE vehicle sales. Says Joyce, The last thing my constituents want is another oppressive Biden administration mandate that puts a radical environmental agenda and far-left special interests above their individual freedoms. (Meanwhile, in France, 41 (and 59 from ages 18 to 24) approved the idea of limiting people to four airplane flights over their entire lifetime.) Analyzing the British marketplace, Telegraph city editor Ben Marlow suggests that the time has come to accept that the economics of net zero are more fantasy than reality. Despite London mayor Sadiq Khan's infamous Ultra-Low Emissions Zone scheme that forced ICE vehicle drivers to pay 12.50 per day just to enter downtown London, an initial spike in EV sales petered out quickly, leading to layoffs at EV assembly plants, carlots full of unsold EVs, and a price war by frustrated dealerships. In the YOU.S., Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley addressed the United Auto Workers' demands, acknowledging that, we want everyone to participate in our success, but if it prevents us from investing in this transition to EVs ... then everyone is job is at risk if we do not invest. Really? Ford is losing 4.5 billion in its EV division this year despite President Biden's welfare-for-the-rich scheme of massive subsidies for EV purchases, 12 billion for retrofitting auto plants for EV production, and 7.5 billion for charging stations. If Schwab has his way, Ford may soon find itself out of business or relegated to manufacturing nameplates for Chinese Fords. Will Americans understand that the auto workers (who just want a big paycheck before their forced retirement) are the canary in this nation's coal mine - that if their industry dies, the nation's economy dies with it? It will take great courage to stand up to teacher unions, indoctrinated children, the deplatforming media, the Justice Department, and hate speech from on high to demand an end to the climate hysteria that elitists use to scare people into accepting a massive decline in their prosperity. But that is the battle - more than immigration, funding foreign wars, or even structural racism - that ought to be the dividing line in 2024. Like 2020's vaccine mandates, EV mandates force tremendous losses of personal freedom. And our children are being taught that freedom - speaking out against government and the ruling class - is a bad thing. But so is darkness.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The UAW bosses are all in with the EV mandate, but the rank and file just cheered an Orange man in a red elephant jacket.

Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant YOU.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, Did you commit financial crimes while working at FTX? Yes, responded Wang. He said that his crimes, including wire and commodities fraud, were carried out with the help of Bankman-Fried, FTX ex-engineering head Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, who ran sister hedge fund Alameda Research and had been Bankman-Fried's girlfriend. Mr. Wang, do you see any of the people you committed those crimes with in the courtroom today? Roos continued. Wang, dressed in an oversized and wrinkled suit with a red tie and glasses, awkwardly stood up and looked around the courtroom before responding, Yes. The trial, set to last six weeks, will resume on Tuesday with key testimony expected from Ellison, who is considered the prosecution's star witness, having already pleaded guilty to multiple charges. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Thus far, Bankman-Fried, 31, has remained mostly quiet in court intently listening to witnesses and at times writing notes to his attorneys. But as Wang testified against him, Bankman-Fried looked visibly upset, shifting his gaze from his former friend to the ground, and at one point putting his head in his hands. Wang, 30, was technology chief for FTX, which spiraled into bankruptcy in November. He spoke so fast that YOU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan and the prosecutor both stopped him at points to ask that he slow his pace. Much of Wang's testimony on Friday focused on the final days at FTX before the entire operation imploded, including reports in the media detailing Alameda's business practices and its troubling ties to FTX. Wang said that in response to the reporting an emergency meeting was called between Bankman-Fried, Wang and Singh, to discuss shutting down Alameda. He said they ultimately decided against such a move because he and Bankman-Fried were aware that Alameda had no way to repay the roughly 14 billion hole in its books. Prosecutors took the jury through a series of tweets, beginning on November 7. Posts came from the company blaming bank hours for slow withdrawals, while Bankman-Fried tweeted from his personal account, assuring customers that all was fine. FTX was not fine and assets were not fine, Wang testified. On November 12, after FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried asked Wang to drive with him to the Bahamas Securities Commission for a meeting. On the drive, Bankman-Fried told Wang to transfer assets to Bahamian liquidators because he believed they would allow him to maintain control of the company. Wang said he was not in the meeting with the securities authority, though Bankman-Fried's dad was present. Wang said he returned to the YOU.S. and met with prosecutors the next day. He faces up to 50 years in prison when he faces a judge for sentencing following this trial. He told jurors he signed a six-page cooperation agreement that requires him to meet with prosecutors, answer their questions truthfully and turn over evidence. For months, Bankman-Fried has known that Wang and Ellison, who were integral members of his personal and professional inner circles, had turned on him. Both pleaded guilty in December and have since been cooperating with the YOU.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. Wang's testimony, which stretched into Friday, was given under a cooperation agreement with the government. Ellison is expected to take the stand under a similar arrangement. Born in China, Wang moved to the YOU.S. at age 7 and grew up in Minnesota before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study math and computer science. He worked at Google after college. Wang, who first met Bankman-Fried during high school at a summer camp, owned 10 of Alameda, while his boss owned the other 90. Wang told the court about the advantages that Alameda received by having code baked into FTX's software that allowed special access to the crypto exchange. Those privileges ultimately resulted in Alameda owing FTX 8 billion worth of customer deposits. We gave special privileges on FTX that gave unlimited withdrawals on the platform to Alameda, Wang said. Alameda was allowed to withdraw and transfer those funds and had a 65 billion line of credit. When customers deposited USD, it went to Alameda, he said. It existed in the computer code. Alameda could have negative balances and unlimited withdrawals. That bug in the code was written by Nishad Singh, who was FTX's director of engineering, and reviewed by Wang. Bankman-Fried was calling the shots, Wang said. Wang also told the court about a 1 million personal loan he received and a 200 million to 300 million loan in his name from Alameda that was never deposited into his account, but rather was used to make investments into other companies on behalf of FTX. That was all done by Bankman-Fried, he testified. In early 2020, Wang said he discovered for the first time Alameda's negative balance exceeded FTX's revenue, an indication that Alameda was taking customer funds. Wang said he brought this to Bankman-Fried's attention several times. In late 2021, Wang discovered Alameda had withdrawn 3 billion from its 65 billion line of credit. Wang's compensation was a base salary of 200,000 per year plus stock. He owned roughly 17 of FTX. Even though they were co-founders, ultimately it was Sam's decision to make when there were disagreements, he said. Adam Yedidia, who was the prosecution's second witness on Wednesday, continued his testimony on Thursday. Yedidia met Bankman-Fried in college at MIT, and the pair remained close friends. Yedidia, assuming a robotic posture on the stand, worked out of FTX's Hong Kong office from January to October of 2021 and then in the Bahamas until last year's collapse. In his testimony, he referred to a group Signal thread called People of the House, referring to Bankman-Fried's 35 million penthouse, where many employees lived. In terms of who was paying the rent, Yedidia recalled Bankman-Fried saying he assumed it is just Alameda paying for it in the end. Yedidia said Bankman-Fried had told him before he began working in the Bahamas in 2019 that he and Ellison had sex. Bankman-Fried asked Yedidia if it was a good idea for them to date, to which Yedidia said no. Bankman-Fried responded by saying he was expecting that answer. One of Yedidia's responsibilities was fixing the bug in the code that gave Alameda preferential treatment. In June 2022, he submitted a report to Bankman-Fried on Signal that showed 8 billion in customer money held in an internal database tracking the cash wired to an Alameda account called fiat at ftx.com was missing. Yedidia said he and Bankman-Fried spoke about it at the pickleball court at the resort in Nassau, Bahamas. He asked his boss if things were OK. He was concerned because it seemed like a lot of money from FTX customers was at risk. Sam said, we were bulletproof last year. We are not bulletproof this year, Yedidia testified. Yedidia said he asked when they would be bulletproof again. Bankman-Fried said he was not sure, but it may be six months to three years. Yedidia said Bankman-Fried appeared worried or nervous, which he said was atypical. Still, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried and Ellison to handle the situation. On cross-examination, Christian Everdell, Bankman-Fried's attorney, focused on how Yedidia was the one responsible for developing and reviewing the code. He asked about the long hours employees worked and Yedidia's concern for Wang being near burnout. That resulted in Yedidia instituting a rule to not wake Wang at night for bug fixes because he needed sleep. Everdell also drilled Yedidia on his high level of compensation in his less than two years at FTX. His base salary was between 175,000 and 200,000, but he received multiple bonuses of more than 12 million in cash and company equity. Yedidia said he is now teaching math -- geometry and algebra -- at a high school. He invested most of the millions he earned as bonuses back into FTX, and his equity stake is now worthless. As FTX was failing, Yedidia said he was by Bankman-Fried's side. He highlighted a Signal exchange in November 2022, during which he wrote, I love you Sam. I am not going anywhere. He said he wrote the message because so many people had left. When asked what changed, Yedidia said he learned that FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to creditors. He said Alameda's actions seemed flagrantly wrong. Yedidia's testimony ended on a fiery note, which was later struck from the record. He was asked why he had lost faith in FTX and resigned. FTX defrauded all its customers, he said. The third witness to take the stand was Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner of Paradigm, a crypto venture capital firm that invested over 275 million in FTX. That stake was wiped out. Huang testified about his firm's due diligence on FTX, and he told the court that Bankman-Fried assured him that funds would be used for FTX and not Alameda. Additionally, he was promised that Alameda had no preferential treatment on the FTX platform, even though the hedge fund was one of its top traders. Huang said he was concerned about FTX's lack of a board of directors, but he eventually invested anyway. During cross-examination, Huang said Paradigm pressed Bankman-Fried on the board issue and was told he did not want investors as directors but he did plan on having a board with experts.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant YOU.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, Did you commit financial crimes while working at FTX?

Shane Jenkins -- who refers to himself as Skullet due to his shaved head and mullet -- was found guilty of nine criminal counts in March, including felony civil disorder; obstruction of an official proceeding; assaulting, resisting or impeding and officer using a dangerous weapon; and destruction of government property. The federal government had requested more than 19 years in federal prison, which would have been one of the longest sentences given in any January 6 case. The longest sentence so far went to Enrique Tarrio, the former head of the Proud Boys, who received 22 years in federal prison last month after being convicted of seditious conspiracy in May. Jenkins' attorney called January 6 one of the saddest episodes in American history and said there remain many grifters out there who remain free to continue propagating the 'great lie' that Trump won the election, Donald Trump being among the most prominent. The government called Jenkins' conduct egregious and said he planned for violent insurrection long before his arrival in D.C. His lack of remorse is extraordinary, and he thinks that political violence is acceptable, Assistant YOU.S. Attorney David Perri argued in during the sentencing hearing on Friday. What happens if his preferred candidate gets convicted of something? Perri asked, referencing the four pending criminal cases against former President Donald Trump, including one case unfolding in the same federal courthouse in D.C. where Jenkins was sentenced. How would he react? Perri encouraged the judge not to roll the dice with this country's democratic future. Attorney Dennis Boyle said during the hearing that Trump promoted a legal fiction that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the election results, and that people like Jenkins were particularly susceptible to Trump's lies and propaganda. Before his sentencing, Jenkins talked about his troubled childhood and said his life began to come apart when he learned he was adopted. He said he tried destroying himself with drugs and alcohol after he killed his stepdad in a gunfight when he was 20 years old. (Jenkins said he shot his stepfather in self-defense, and was not charged.) The Justice Department also said that Jenkins took part in an attack on January 6 defendant Taylor Taranto -- who was arrested outside of former President Barack Obama's home -- on July 10, when a dozen inmates allegedly entered the television room of their pod and assaulted Taranto because Taranto had been saying derogatory things about Ashli Babitt and her mother. Taranto was ordered held in pretrial detention. In the 33 months since the Capitol attack, more than 1,100 participants have been arrested, and about 660 have received sentences, including nearly 400 who have received sentences of incarceration.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Shane Jenkins was found guilty of nine criminal counts in March.

Where we then took a direct hit, Mr Charles wrote on YouTube while sharing the footage on Tuesday. Watch the video below: The video begins with the team being pelted by hail in their car while approaching the twister. As they drive towards it, a massive circulating cloud appears in front of them. It is coming right at us. We are immediately downstream of it, one of the crew members is heard saying. The group then stops and gets out of the car to capture shots of the cyclone, before continuing to track it. Then suddenly, a gust of wind brings power lines down right on top of their vehicle, effectively trapping them as sparks begin to fly. If this was not terrifying enough, the group then suddenly realises that the tornado has surfaced right next to them. They stop their car as the power line continues to spark around them.

Each episode will focus on one of those states -- the distracted brain, the frightened brain, the nourished brain, etc. -- to spotlight what is going on in our heads and how it impacts our bodies. (CNN) -- Menopause, which marks the end of a woman's reproductive life, is something roughly half of the world's population will go through if they live long enough. But this stage -- like so much surrounding women's health -- is poorly understood. A drop in hormones, primarily estrogen, is the driving force behind menopause's signature event: the reduction and eventual end of fertility. Yet women experience a long list of other symptoms during perimenopause (the years leading up to menopause) that are not limited to the reproductive organs, such as hot flashes, brain fog, mood swings, exhaustion and sleep disturbances. But it was only relatively recently that researchers learned that estrogen's influence can be felt far beyond the uterus and ovaries. The fact that estrogen has an impact on the brain was only discovered in 1996, Lisa Mosconi, an associate professor of neuroscience and the director of the Women's Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta. For context, men landed on the moon 30 years prior. Mosconi and her team imaged the brains of more than 160 women between the ages of 40 and 65. The women were premenopausal (still getting regular periods), perimenopausal and postmenopausal (after they had stopped getting periods for more than one year). What she discovered was startling and even revolutionary: women's brains underwent a remodeling. That is to say, some areas shrank, others grew, and regions got rewired. (While her paper was published in 2021 in Nature Scientific Reports, Mosconi has kept adding women's brain scans to her database.) Menopause is the third of the three P's -- these three phases that the female brain goes through in life -- which are puberty, pregnancy and perimenopause... And those three phases are seen very differently culturally and in society, but from a neurological perspective, from a brain perspective, they have a lot in common, Mosconi explained, noting that they all involve big changes in the brain, not just the body. As for the brain changes during menopause, Mosconi said, there is this huge neurological system that links your brain with your ovaries that is so important for reproduction, for hosting a baby, for hosting a pregnancy -- that then needs to be dismantled once you are no longer reproductive. And all three phases come with vulnerability -- there are a lot of unpleasant symptoms that can arise due to menopause -- but also with resilience. And I think the resilience aspect has been completely overlooked in medicine, in science and certainly in culture, Mosconi said. She adds that what happens during menopause can have implications for brain health in later years. Listen to the full Chasing Life podcast episode with Professor Lisa Mosconi and Dr Sanjay Gupta right here: If you were assigned female at birth, what can you do to weather this major midlife shift in the best way possible? Here are Mosconi's top five tips: Say 'no' to tobacco The number one tip Mosconi offered is to avoid cigarette smoking, and even passive smoke, calling it a very selective ovarian toxin. It literally disrupts the tissues of the ovaries and impairs the process... by which follicles eventually develop into menstruation, Mosconi said. And that is the reason that heavy smokers tend to experience menopause at an earlier age than nonsmokers. Smoking can make the symptoms of menopause worse which is something nobody really wants or needs, she added. That is not all. Active smoking is a huge 'no' for both menopause but also for brain health, she said. It really increases oxidation and free radical production in the entire body and brain, which accelerates cellular aging. So it makes your age faster at a neurological level, which is definitely not something anybody needs. If you are exposed to second-hand smoke, she advises investing in an air purifier. It is really important, she said, because it can make a huge difference in deceasing smoke exposure. Get moving Mosconi's second tip may not surprise anyone, given it has been shown to be so helpful as we age: exercise. Physical activity is really supportive of hormonal health and brain health, she noted. And when it comes to hormonal and brain health, she said aerobic exercise -- including brisk walking -- gives you the biggest bang for your buck. It is particularly helpful for alleviating the intensity and number of hot flashes, she said, as well as for addressing brain fog and memory lapses, and improving cognitive function. For better sleep, flexibility, stress reduction and balance, she recommends yoga or Pilates; for improving strength, her go-to is resistance bands or light weights. Eat right Again, no surprise here: A plant-based diet full of whole foods is good for everyone. A balanced, healthy diet, rich in produce, fruits, vegetables and foods that contain antioxidants, Mosconi said. You can never eat enough plants, so eat more plants. There is a lot of research on diet and brain health and there is a lot less research on diet and brain health for women -- nonetheless, we do have the information. I think that it is very consistent and it shows that... plant foods really are the name of the game for women's health for a number of reasons. Those reasons include that they contain fiber (which Mosconi said helps regulate estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in the blood) and antioxidants. The brain is the one organ that is most easily affected by oxidative stress, which is this kind of almost inflammation, almost a rusting of brain cells ... that happens with aging, with metabolic activity, she said. It is really important that our diets are very high in antioxidants that can counteract the aging effect that takes place in the brain, especially for women. Antioxidants are only found in plant-based foods. Prioritize sleep Sleep hygiene is very important for hormonal health as well, Mosconi said. In fact, getting restorative rest is essential to many aspects of brain and body health, from immune function to maintaining a healthy body weight, to consolidating memories. Talk to a doc about HRT Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) received a bad rap years ago. But more recent studies have found that at the right time and for the right women, HRT is safe and can alleviate some of the most vexing symptoms of menopause -- a stance that is reflected in the 2022 North American Menopause Society position statement. Do talk to a health care provider about hormones and find out whether or not you are eligible for hormone replacement therapy and whether or not that might be helpful to you specifically, Mosconi said. Estrogen for women, and testosterone for men, are not just hormones that are involved in reproduction, they are not only important for fertility, they are also extremely important for brain health and brain function, she said. They keep your brain active. They keep your brain energized, they keep your brain young because they also have an anti-aging effect. Mosconi is putting her money where her mouth is. I am in my 40s and I am premenopausal, which means I have a regular cycle. And this is a great time to prepare, so I do a ton of stuff, she said. I have changed my whole routine to prepare for menopause: I have changed my diet, I have changed my exercise... I prioritize sleep hygiene in a very, very specific way... I do stress reduction. I get rid of all sources of environmental toxins in the house as best I can, she said. And I am also tracking hormones and cycles, and preparing mentally ... trying to decide whether or not I would take hormones. We hope these five recommendations prepare you for taking care of your brain during perimenopause and beyond. Listen to the full episode here.

What happened next?,"At 6:52 a.m., she took the escalator into a metro station in the Iranian capital of Tehran, her short, dark hair uncovered. Roughly 16 minutes later, the girl -- identified by authorities and activists as 16-year-old Armita Geravand -- was lying, seemingly unconscious, on the subway platform. These details were gleaned from a patchwork of security camera footage that has been aired by Iran's state broadcaster and reviewed by NBC News. The grainy and soundless footage does not appear to be obviously manipulated, and appears to cover much of her time inside the station on Sunday, bar a gap of just under 90 seconds before she reaches the turnstiles. However, the girl disappears from view during the crucial moment: a four-second period when she actually boards the subway carriage and ends up on the floor. Human rights activists have called on Iranian authorities to release any security footage from inside the car itself, which a prominent Kurdish rights group has said would show government agents physically assaulting her for allegedly violating the country's Islamic dress code. Authorities have denied this, saying that Geravand had no altercation with the morality police, instead fainting and hitting her head after a drop in blood pressure. Most trains in Tehran have multiple security cameras that are viewable by guards, according to The Associated Press, leading government critics to question why it has not released footage from inside the car that would corroborate its side of the story. But Iran's state-run IRNA news agency interviewed a conductor who said this train, number 134, did not. The door opened, three teenage students entered the train and just when they got in, seconds later she lost her balance and fell, he said. State media also ran interviews with people identified as Geravand's parents, and what it said were friends who were with her on the day. They also said there was no encounter with morality police and that she had suddenly fallen. Human rights groups have frequently accused Iranian authorities of forcing those involved in such incidents to deliver statements under duress. Hengaw, an Iranian Kurdish rights group based in Norway, said Geravand fell into a coma as a result of injuries it said were inflicted by the morality police. According to reports obtained by the group, she was physically attacked by authorities, it said Tuesday. The group also posted a photo that it said showed her in bed at an air force hospital's intensive care unit. It said authorities had imposed strict security measures around the hospital and her family. Reuters, citing two unnamed prominent rights activists inside Iran, reported that she was in a coma and that security forces were heavily involved around the hospital. The case has generated significant attention on social media, echoing that of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman whose death in hospital after being detained by morality police last year sparked mass protests. Tehran has dismissed the growing global outrage, and accused Western countries that have spoken out, including the United States, of insincere concern. It painted the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi as further evidence of Western efforts to stoke tensions. Nevertheless the Geravand incident is a potential public relations crisis for the Islamic Republic, which is looking to prevent this becoming a repeat of the Mahsa Amini protests, said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House, a London think tank. NBC News collated and analyzed several bits of footage posted by Iranian state-run media that when stitched together track a large part of Geravand's progress through the station. Just after 6:52 a.m. local time Sunday (11:22 p.m. Sunday ET), a person identified by Iran's state broadcasters as Geravand walks into Meydan-E Shohada, or Martyrs' Square, Metro station in southern Tehran, the security camera footage shows. She takes the escalator down toward the platform, and goes through the turnstiles using her metro card, according to the film, some of which is sped-up. After that, she is seen going into a store and heading to the platform. She waits on the platform as one train arrives and leaves, before boarding the last carriage of the next train. Then four seconds later, at 7:08 a.m., another passenger steps back out of the carriage onto the platform edge, crouching down to seemingly attend to someone who is still inside the train and hidden from view. That person, identified by Iranian state-run media as Geravand, is then carried out of the car appearing to be motionless, laid on the platform and surrounded by other people as the train leaves. This is where the aired footage ends, timestamped 7:09 a.m. The key gap in the evidence has fueled demands from human rights groups for clarity about what transpired during those four seconds, especially given what is been happening over the past year in Iran. After the protests over Amini's death, many women in urban areas started wearing their hair uncovered in a show of defiance on a level never seen before. At the same time, the government has been extraordinarily repressive over the past year and cracking down on protests and trying to push people off of the streets, Vakil at Chatham House said. Authorities have used very aggressive means, from surveillance, arrest, torture and execution, she said, setting up a tug and pull tension between the heavy-handed regime and dissenting public. In recent months authorities have moved to crack down on that visible show of dissent, restoring the morality police to the streets and seeking to reimpose the mandatory hijab laws. Iran's parliament last month passed a law that would impose punishments of up to 10 years in prison for women who disobey the rules on headscarves. The bill must be ratified by the Guardian Council, an unelected conservative legislative body. It is against that backdrop that Geravand's hospitalization has emerged to once again fuel angry accusations against the state. Unhappiness over the headscarf rules are a reflection of a broader dissatisfaction with the government on an array of issues that span politics, economics, society and culture, Vakil said. And when you put them together, in a country as large as Iran, she said, it creates a tinderbox.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"16-year-old Armita Geravand was found unconscious on a Tehran subway platform on Sunday.

Weather.com,"Gone are the days when lions ruled the African savannas, striking terror in the hearts of their prey with their mighty roars. A new 'super predator' that is mostly nondescript, with a lack of fangs, claws, venom, or even a particularly scary voice, has been terrorising the animals of Africa: the human. According to a study conducted in South Africa's Greater Kruger National Park -- home to one of the largest remaining lion populations in the world, mammals living there are more afraid of a human being's voice than they are of lion snarls or sounds synonymous with hunting, like dog barks and gunshots. Recent global research has indicated that humans kill prey at much higher rates than other predators. Thus, despite lions being the biggest group-hunting land predator on the planet, we have become more lethal killers. Researchers observed how 19 different species of mammals reacted to recordings of human voices, lion vocalisations, barking dogs, and gunshots as a part of their South African mega-experiment. Clips of humans talking came from radio or television recordings of people speaking the four most used languages in the region (Tsonga, Northern Sotho, English, and Afrikaans), their volumes at conversational levels. The noises of dogs and gunshots were played to mimic the sounds associated with humans hunting while lion growls and snarls were curated with the help of an expert to signal the presence of the apex predator in the region. Then, they placed custom waterproof systems combined with a camera trap and speakers at waterholes to record animals that visited it to quench their thirst. However, creating this system was not without challenges. We put the camera in a bear box, not because there are bears out in South Africa, but because of the hyenas and leopards that like to chew on them, said first author Liana Y Zanette. One night, the lion recording made this elephant so angry that it charged and just smashed the whole thing.. When they studied these videos, they found that the animals were twice as likely to abandon the waterholes and run away when they heard humans compared to lions or hunting noises. In fact, 95 of the species that were analysed, including giraffes, leopards, hyenas, zebras, warthog, impala, elephants and rhinos, ran more often or abandoned waterholes sooner in response to humans than in response to lions. Highlighting that the fear of humans is ingrained and pervasive in these wild animals, the study's authors ponder if this very fear could be exploited for conservation purposes. The team is investigating if the custom sound system they created could be used to deliberately shoo away some endangered animals from known poaching grounds in South Africa. Amazingly, they have been able to keep rhinos away from frequenting certain areas using human voice recordings.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A new 'super predator' has been terrorising the animals of Africa: the human.

The infiltration took place as militants fired dozens of rockets into Israel. The Israeli military said a number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory. It gave no further details, but amateur videos posted on social media showed what appeared to be uniformed gunmen inside the Israeli border town of Sderot. The sound of gunfire could be heard in the videos, whose authenticity could not immediately be verified. The infiltration came as militants in the Gaza Strip launched dozens of rockets toward Israel early Saturday, setting off air raid sirens across the country and raising the likelihood of a new round of heavy fighting. The sound of outgoing rockets whooshing through the air could be heard in Gaza and sirens wailed as far away as Tel Aviv, some 70 kilometers (40 miles) to the north, during an early morning barrage that lasted more than 30 minutes. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue agency said a 70-year-old woman was critically injured when a rocket hit a building in southern Israel. Elsewhere, a 20-year-old man was moderately injured by rocket shrapnel, it said. As the rocket attacks continued throughout southern and central Israel, millions of Israelis were instructed to stay near bomb shelters in their homes and apartment buildings. The army said residents next to Gaza should stay in their homes due to the security incident. Palestinian media in Gaza reported a possible attempt by militants to infiltrate Israel, but no further details were immediately known. There was no immediate response from Israel. But the Israeli military usually carries out airstrikes in response to rocket fire, raising the likelihood of wider fighting.

Singapores 24-hour PSI air pollution reading in the east of the island rose as high as 117, according to the National Environment Agency website on Saturday. An index reading between 101 and 200 is deemed unhealthy, while a level above 300 is categorised as hazardous. Indonesia said seven provinces have declared a state of emergency for land and forest fires, but denied that haze from Indonesia had spread to other countries. Up until this morning, we have not detected any transboundary haze, Laksmi Dewanti, director general of climate change control at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said at a press briefing. Satellite imagery on Saturday showed more than 7,700 hotspots  seven times the number recorded a year ago, she said. A week ago, Malaysia complained that smoke from fires in Indonesias southern Sumatra and Kalimantan had reached Malaysia, shrouding some areas of the country and causing air quality to drop. Indonesia denies that it was the source of the pollution. The choking smoke from fires is a recurring problem in Southeast Asia, disrupting tourism and, at its worst, causing severe respiratory illness and costing local economies billions of dollars. It mostly originates from natural or man-made fires in Indonesia and Malaysia during the dry season. Many of the blazes result from illegal burning to clear farmland for cash crops such as palm oil, a practice that persists despite years of government efforts to stamp it out. Indonesias foreign ministry said earlier that Malaysia sent a letter to the environment and forestry ministry, describing the latest air quality situation and offering to cooperate on dealing with the forest fires if needed. Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya said in a phone message that Indonesia has had a systematic prevention and management system in place for forest fires for the past eight years and that no cooperation was needed for now. Director General of Environmental Law Enforcement Rasio Ridho Sani said the government has sealed 35 plantation areas belonging to Indonesian, Malaysian and Singaporean companies and may revoke permits for those found to be repeat offenders. Clearing land by burning or failing to take precautions to prevent forest fires can lead to a fine of up to 10 billion rupiah (US640,000), 10 years in prison or deduction of company profits. Fires are typically worst at the height of the dry season in August and September, but in El Nino years rains are often delayed, allowing the burning to spread into October and beyond. Almost 3,000 hotspots were detected in Indonesia in mid-September, with Sumatra and the Indonesian part of Borneo island, called Kalimantan, accounting for more than two thirds, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.

Ron DeSantis speaks in Washington last month.Al Drago  Bloomberg via Getty Images file Ron DeSantis' missing in action broadside at Donald Trump at the second GOP debate did not come out of nowhere. And the Florida governor has kept up the heat on the former president since. Four months into his presidential campaign, DeSantis is going on the attack against Trump on the campaign trail as the significant polling gap between the top two candidates remains static. The decision to take on the favorite from the debate stage was the biggest forum yet for these attacks, but it was also just another milestone in an evolving war of words with Trump. Coming off the debate stage in California, DeSantis has been more frequent and pointed in his criticisms of Trump than ever. Asked by a supporter in the audience during a campaign event in Tampa whether he could fill arenas like Trump, DeSantis said that Americans were voting against Trump in 2020 and that he continues to be a major motivating factor for Democratic voters. You could have John Kennedy walk through the door right now and he would not energize Democrats as much as Donald Trump does, DeSantis posited. Only moments later, the governor shrugged off Trump's fundraising numbers at a news conference, posing a rhetorical question: Well, why is he raising that money and where is that money going to? Is not it going to a lot of lawyers? In the early weeks of his campaign for the White House, DeSantis did not often launch direct criticisms at the former president, often redirecting questions about Trump's conduct -- and Trump's lead in the polls -- back to his home-state record. In Florida, everything we promised, we did, and we actually over-delivered on our promises, DeSantis told reporters during a trip to the border in late June when asked if he would tell Trump it is time for other Republican leaders to take the party's mantle. His early summer argument against Trump centered on a case for electability. DeSantis argued he could win a general election unlike Trump's loss in 2020, and he could bring down-ticket Republicans across the finish line unlike Trump's midterm endorsees who faced mixed electoral results -- and, if elected, he could serve two consecutive terms in the White House, unlike Trump. It was not all one-note: At times, the governor deviated from his usual answer to brandish a sharper rhetorical strike against Trump. Well, clearly, the swamp was not drained. I do not think anyone would say that it was in any way, shape or form, DeSantis told a Wisconsin radio show in July when goaded to take Trump on directly. The following week, Trump announced he had received a target letter in the January 6 federal inquiry -- an investigation that would later see him charged on counts of conspiring to defraud the YOU.S. -- just moments before DeSantis unveiled his military reform plan in an airport hangar in West Columbia, South Carolina. I think it was shown how he was in the White House and did not do anything while things were going on. He should have come out more forcefully, DeSantis told reporters during the news conference portion of the policy event. As the summer progressed, new fissures developed as Trump opened himself to more criticisms from fellow Republicans. Trump skipped the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, and a newly detected Covid variant gave new salience to his 2020 pandemic response. But it was comments Trump on NBC's Meet the Press criticizing the strictest Republican-backed abortion bans that garnered the biggest outcry, not only from DeSantis but also from other Republican leaders. DeSantis has seized on the openings. The week after DeSantis visited the Iowa State Fair grounds outside Des Moines, the governor took aim at the former president's decision to ditch the debate stage. You have to earn this nomination. Nobody's entitled to it. You have got to get up there and you have got to answer questions, you have got to be able to defend your record, he told Fox News Radio. I was the only candidate he cared about in Iowa, he continued, referring to Trump's simultaneous visit to the state and the protesters who shouted at him at the fair. He came because I was there, and he wanted to try and take some of the attention away from us, he added. So, if you already had it in the bag, you would not worry about any other candidate. The heat turned up again when a newly spreading coronavirus variant prompted re-litigation of Trump's pandemic response. DeSantis told conservative commentator Dave Rubin on his streaming show that Trump hurts himself when he picks fights over their respective records on Covid response. He said I was one of the great governors in America, DeSantis recalled, adding that during the midterm elections Trump saw that I was fixing to win a landslide and he started attacking me, and then that is basically it. Just because he believes that I am a threat to his ambitions. One issue in particular has proved a crucial -- and repeated -- opening for DeSantis: abortion. Trump said on Meet the Press that some of his fellow Republicans had gone too far on restricting abortion and he himself could be the candidate that brings both sides together on the issue, opened himself to criticism not only from Republican presidential candidates, but from GOP governors like Iowa's Kim Reynolds and Georgia's Brian Kemp. DeSantis, who himself signed a law banning abortion after six weeks of gestation, one of the earliest legal lines in the country, unleashed his sharpest attack yet. I think all pro-lifers should know that he is preparing to sell you out, DeSantis told Radio Iowa. Days later, he told another Hawkeye radio station that Trump's comments were unacceptable and that caucusgoers would find them troubling. DeSantis hypothesized to Glenn Beck that Democrats will weaponize what he said to try to defeat the because of life. Trump holds a commanding polling lead in the Republican field. The most recent NBC News poll shows the former president with a 43-point lead over DeSantis, in line with the current national polling averages. DeSantis often says it remains too early for the electorate to be fully engaged and that early-state polls like from Iowa and New Hampshire show more fluidity in the GOP electorate -- and are better places to look for momentum that his campaign is building. Though DeSantis has ramped up his rhetoric on Trump as the former president opened lanes of attack against himself, the attacks are not one-sided. The Trump campaign takes aim at DeSantis regularly, tangling with campaign staffers on social media, bashing him in press releases and branding the governor with a signature Trump nickname: DeSanctimonious. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt of a flailing candidate who is in the last throes of his campaign, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement responding to DeSantis' attacks. He is getting crushed in the polls -- both statewide and national -- and President Trump is the only person who polls above Joe Biden. Asked about the new tone of his comments on Trump, DeSantis repeated a challenge he had made in the days following the debate during an event last week at the Los Angeles Harbor Grain Terminal: that he would be eager to debate Trump one-on-one. He is had a lot to say about me on social media over the last nine months. Well, now we can get up there and we can make this case in person, DeSantis told reporters. It remains unclear if they will ever face off in person. Trump has skipped the first two Republican primary debates and his campaign has said he is set to skip the third. DeSantis, meanwhile, has taken on his fellow GOP contenders in Milwaukee and Simi Valley -- and even agreed to a debate with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, skipping over his Republican colleagues to take on a leading Democratic leader head-on. But without a head-on encounter between the two, the two top-polling candidates will likely continue their war of words by proxy with social media and campaign speeches serving as an interim debate forum. Speaking at the California GOP's fall convention in Anaheim, where Trump had delivered his own address a few hours earlier, DeSantis made a point of telling the crowd that he was speaking off-the-cuff. Trump, in his remarks, had taken credit both for flipping Florida in Republicans' favor and for DeSantis' burgeoning national profile. I understand that one of my residents was here earlier saying that he turned Florida red, DeSantis quipped. I just wish, he continued, if he was the one that turned Florida red, that he would not have turned Georgia and Arizona blue, because that is not been good for us at all.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Ron DeSantis' broadside at Donald Trump at the second GOP debate did not come out of nowhere.

Cho Oyu expedition conducive to Xizang's ecological protection,"Yao said the snow and ice samples at the summit were collected for the first time to reveal the change process and mechanism of the Asian water tower cryosphere, which provides scientific support for the ecological protection of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Compared with the small radar (less than half a meter in length) used during the expedition of Mount Qomolangma, a larger radar (over one meter in length) was used this time in order to better detect thicker ice on the summit of Mount Cho Oyu, said Yang Wei, a researcher from the Institute of Xizang Plateau Research of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Though human expedition to extremely high-altitude mountains is greatly limited, the expedition on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is necessary to protect the local environment, such as the most important and fragile Asian water tower, and avoid disasters led by melting glaciers such as ice floods and avalanches, said Yang. Yang recalled the two ice avalanches in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River in October 2018, during which the glacial debris blocked the river, threatening the downstream areas. The big elevation gap between the glaciers and the Yarlung Zangbo River resulted in the high possibility of ice avalanche, said Yang. He and his colleagues had spent a year conducting research, testing, and installing equipment and successfully achieved early warning of ice floods and avalanches in the area. Five automatic weather stations have been set up at the altitudes of 4,950, 5,700, 6,450, 7,100, and 8,201 meters on Mt. Cho Oyu, and precipitation observation equipment was installed at the two lower stations. They can monitor the carbon dioxide in the air to record the situation and changes in the carbon sink. Together with the Qomolangma-Shishapangma weather stations already established, this expanded meteorological observation network will help reveal more characteristics of climate change in this extremely high-altitude region, said researcher Zhao Huabiao, also from the Institute of Xizang Plateau Research. Since the launch of the second comprehensive scientific expedition to the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau in 2017, China's scientific research team has recorded a series of important signs of progress, which show that the total carbon sink of the entire Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is 120 to 140 million tonnes per year, and the carbon emissions are about 55 million tonnes per year, achieving a carbon surplus of over 65 million tonnes, said Yao. The entire Qinghai-Xizang Plateau has achieved carbon neutrality and will become increasingly significant to China's dual carbon goals with the overall ecological improvement, Yao added.

A couple was celebrating their wedding day in Mississippi on Saturday when an alleged serial wedding crasher snuck in. Sandra Lynn Henson, 57, has been accused of crashing weddings in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee and stealing money and cards from purses, according to the Pontotoc Sheriff's Department. She was already wanted in Alabama, the department said, when she was caught with sticky fingers at Lexi Loden and Brady Butler's wedding in Pontotoc County. When Sandra turned around in the bridal room, she was eating a piece of my cake, said newlywed Lexi Loden Butler, who recalled how her sister caught Henson at her wedding at Lilly Creek Farm. Henson was arrested Sept. 30 and charged with petit larceny, trespassing, and disturbing the peace, the sheriff's department said Monday. Henson has since bonded out of jail, Sheriff Leo Mask said. Last week's wedding was the latest in a string of wedding crashing incidents allegedly linked to Henson. From what we understand, she is been charged with wedding crashing several times, Mask said. He said he was unsure about Henson's convictions because some cases were in other states. Henson was on parole in Mississippi, where she would been behind bars on burglary and grand larceny charges, according to state corrections department records. In 2019, Henson was accused of taking gifts from two weddings in Alabama, the Florence Alabama Police Department said at the time. She was charged with two counts of property theft. The outcome of the cases was not immediately clear Friday night. In 2021, Henson stole wedding gifts, cash and gift cards amounting to over 1,000 in her home state of Mississippi and was indicted on a charge of grand larceny. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced in Marshall County to five years' probation, court records show. Henson was caught this time by Loden Butler's sister, who had entered the bridal suite to fix a bottle for her baby when she found Henson rummaging through belongings. Loden Butler said her sister asked Henson who she was at the wedding for and Henson replied I am here for Lexi. After Henson failed to answer other questions about the wedding, Loden Butler said her sister got help from other family members. The wedding coordinator found that 200 had been taken out of her purse, which Henson initially denied when asked, Loden Butler said. When threatened with calling the cops, she admitted to stealing 200 in cash, Kristian Joshlin, Loden Butler's other sister, said in an interview. Henson had the money hidden in her bra. Henson then pulled the 200 out of her bra and handed it to back to the family, Loden Butler said. Joshlin said Henson begged the family not to call the police because she said she did not want to go back to jail. She said they notified the Pontotoc County police shortly after. She apologized and talked about how good she would been doing lately, saying, 'I have been going to church and doordashing,' Joshlin said. Joshlin and Loden Butler said they think Henson got the information about the wedding online or from social media. In Henson's belongings, they said they found a notebook listing the locations of at least seven other weddings and couples in the area. The notebook blew my mind and broke my heart at the same time, Loden Butler said. To have people have no idea that their name is in a book and that they are a target ... to go that far and to be that deep with something like that. Loden Butler said she was grateful that her family hid the incident from her and her new husband until the police arrived on the scene.

Bob Menendez's wife,"Police dashcam video and audio recordings are raising new questions about how local police and Bergen County prosecutors handled the 2018 fatal crash investigation involving a woman who soon married New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez. Dashcam video from the scene that evening in Bogota, N.J., shows Nadine Arslanian Menendez saying that she done nothing wrong. At one point, she also asks an officer about the pedestrian who she had just struck and killed, Why was the guy in the middle of the street? Several sources familiar with the matter are asking why a retired chief of detectives for the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office showed up at the crash scene to apparently speak to police and assist Nadine Menendez. The sources pointed to one section of the police dashboard video footage where retired the retired chief, Michael Mordaga, is heard asking police what is going on. An officer replies, That is what we are gathering now ... it is dark... her breath, ya know? Police reports have suggested there was no signs that Nadine Arslsanian Menendez was driving while impaired at the time of the crash. Police reports also show that no Breathalyzer or other tests were performed on Menendez that night. One can imagine police ordering someone to at least perform field sobriety tests just based on those words and observations alone, said NBC legal analyst Danny Cevallos. Investigators said the victim, Richard Kopp, 49, had jaywalked after drinking with friends on the night that Nadine Menendez hit him with her Mercedes. As NBC News first reported, the state attorney general is now investigating whether police and Bergen county prosecutors handled the fatal crash scene appropriately. Nadine Menendez's connection to the death of Richard Koop has come to light only this week. Mrs. Menendez's lawyer, David Schertler, said in a statement, This is a case of a tragic accident, but Nadine Menendez was not at fault, did not violate any laws, and was therefore not charged with any crimes. Schertler added, We are confident that any are-opening' of an investigation into the accident will confirm that conclusion. Several sources said public integrity division investigators from the state attorney general's office want to know who asked Mordaga to come to the crash scene. Mordaga did not return several calls for comment. A source close to Nadine Menendez said she was not drinking before the crash. But it is still unclear who might have called Mordaga to the scene. The optics of a former police chief or retired officer coming out to an accident scene and intervening on behalf of one of the people involved in the accident -- they just are not good, Cevallos said. New Jersey attorney general records show that one of the Bogota officers on scene, Michael LaFerrera, was later suspended for roughly 6 months for his handling of a separate DUI-related case. LaFerrera, union officials and other Bogota police representatives did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for state Attorney General Matthew Platkin, whose investigators questioned prosecution and police staff on Thursday about the handling of the accident, had no comment Questions about the crashed Mercedes came to light in the midst the sprawling bribery indictment against Bob Menendez, his wife and three businessmen. The FBI accuse Bob and Nadine Menendez of asking businessman Jose Uribe for help paying for a new Mercedes. In exchange, the senator allegedly tried to intervene with a state attorney general investigation that Uribe was concerned about. All of the individuals charged in the bribery case deny wrongdoing. Nadine Menendez's lawyer denied the bribery case can be tied to the fatal crash, saying the fact of the accident has nothing to do with the allegations in the current indictment against Ms. Menendez.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Dashcam video from the scene that evening in Bogota, N.J., shows Nadine Arslanian Menendez saying that she done nothing wrong.

In New York City, Jhonnattan was among the first to apply for TPS this week, after YOU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services started accepting applications from Venezuelans who have been continuously residing in the YOU.S. since July 31. Jhonnattan, who is only being identified by his first name because of his current legal status, has a pending asylum case that can take years to resolve. Getting TPS could mean having some kind of temporary relief sooner, since those applications are more likely to be processed quicker than asylum claims, immigrant rights advocates said. Jhonnattan, who served in the military back in Venezuela, said he first left his homeland in 2017 and settled in neighboring Colombia after facing death threats and surviving a gun attack. He said he spent six months in a prison after being caught up in the rising political turmoil and protests against President Nicols Maduro, whose leftist regime has eviscerated Venezuela's democratic institutions and helped drive much of the nation into poverty. That is when I said to myself, 'I have to get out of here because they are going to kill me,' he told NBC News in Spanish. After a few years in Colombia, Jhonnattan started fearing for his safety again after he saw that country's leadership soften its approach to Maduro's regime as reports emerged that a high-profile Maduro ally was requesting the return of people who were against the government as well as the military who were asking for political asylum in Colombia, he said. That is when Jhonnattan decided to head to the YOU.S., which had sought to push Maduro out through sanctions and isolation, he said. With TPS, recipients can remain and work in the YOU.S. for 18 months without fear of deportation. The federal government can extend the protection if conditions are still unstable in their home countries. Asylees, those who are granted asylum, can additionally apply for a Social Security card, request permission to travel overseas and petition to bring family members to the YOU.S. Migrants can apply for TPS and asylum at the same time. I am told that getting political asylum takes a long time, too long, Jhonnattan said. It is somewhat difficult, and yes, hard. His asylum application is among the more than 1.3 million still awaiting processing as of May. In fiscal year 2021, Venezuelans accounted for nearly 12 of those granted asylum, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Jhonnattan arrived to New York City on June 2022. Unlike many migrants who do not have family or connections, he was able to stay with members of his extended family who live in the city. In order to provide for his parents and two children still in Venezuela, he borrowed a bicycle and biked around Queens looking for work. He found a job assembling and fixing furniture. Three months later, he started renting a room and living on his own. He recently got his driver's license and started a second job as a driver. New York is one of 18 states that allow noncitizens to get a driver's license. It is time to give it my all to whatever comes my way and always keep my head held high and stay positive, he said. Jhonnattan is among the more than 100,000 migrants who have arrived in New York City over the past year, when Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began putting migrants who came into the YOU.S. through the Texas border on buses and sending them to New York and other Democratic-run cities.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A new expansion of temporary protected status, better known as TPS, could be a game changer for nearly half a million qualifying Venezuelan migrants.

The UAW had been steadily escalating its strike as negotiators haggle over issues including wages, pensions and future battery plant workers. The move is the first time in three weeks that the strike has not been widened to include new plants. About 25,000 union workers have walked out of five assembly plants and 38 parts-distribution facilities since the strike began Sept. 15, including a parts warehouse in Mansfield where several-dozen UAW members work. That represents about one-sixth of the UAW's membership, leaving Fain with many levers left to pull if he wants to inflict more damage on the companies and their supply chains. His strategy has been to keep them guessing about his next move while minimizing the hit to the union's strike fund. In the past week, Ford and GM submitted new proposals to the UAW that included better wages and retirement benefits, respectively. Fain said Friday that Ford's latest offer includes a 23 percent pay raise, higher than the 20 percent from GM and Stellantis. The union wants to emerge from the strike with at least a 30 percent pay raise, down from the 40 percent increase it initially sought. Ford's proposal -- combined with a cost of living allowance to account for inflation -- is likely to meet that threshold, according to a person familiar with the matter.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The UAW had been steadily escalating its strike as negotiators haggle over issues.

While the administration is still working through the details of how this would change the YOU.S. relationship with Niger and affect the presence of YOU.S. diplomats and troops there, the announcement could come in the next week, the officials said. An official assessment that the government was overthrown in a military coup would trigger Section 7008 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Appropriations Act, a YOU.S. law that restricts the assistance that the YOU.S. can provide to a country. The YOU.S. military had more than 1,100 troops at three different bases in Niger before the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, was taken hostage in his residence on July 26 by military officials, led by the head of the Presidential Guard, Gen. Abdourahamane Tchiani. Prior to Bazoum's ouster, YOU.S. troops trained Nigerien military special forces, supported them in planning for counterterror missions, and provided intelligence and remote support during Nigerien military operations. In the days following the takeover, the Pentagon suspended security cooperation between the YOU.S. military and Nigerien military, halted foreign military sales, and paused some foreign assistance programs. On August 5, the YOU.S. halted nearly 200 million in foreign assistance programs to Niger. Officially designating the change in government a coup could suspend hundreds of millions more in assistance, according to a senior YOU.S. administration official, though some humanitarian and health assistance would be likely to continue. A State Department spokesperson did not confirm any impending change. We do not have anything to announce. We are continuing to advocate for a diplomatic solution that preserves constitutional order and democracy in Niger. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said the administration is continuing our diplomatic engagements to preserve civilian rule in Niger. We have also continued assessing our next steps, including making a formal 7008 determination. If we make a determination, we will announce, but at the moment, I have nothing to preview. I would note that a formal 7008 determination has been something we have considered since the beginning, nothing new and nothing to announce today. President Bazoum and members of his family are still being held hostage in Niger, the administration officials said. The coup has threatened to derail the YOU.S. effort to fight Islamist militants in Africa's volatile Sahel region, where Niger has played a pivotal and reliable role as a partner and hub for counterterrorism efforts in the region. In recent years, Niger has also become a melting pot for various terror networks who have exploited coups and instability in neighboring countries and then crossed into Niger to prey on civilians and military along the borders. Since the July 26 coup, YOU.S. officials warn there has already been an uptick in ISIS attacks along the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali, countries to Niger's west that have both undergone coups in recent years, as well. The officials say the Nigerien military has been somewhat distracted since the coup and less focused on counterterrorism operations against ISIS, and that ISIS is exploiting that. While the YOU.S. military does not have concrete numbers, it estimates that dozens of members of the Nigerien military have been killed and wounded in ISIS attacks recently. Since the president's overthrow, a group known as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has threatened to send troops to Niger to restore him to power. Even though YOU.S. officials say the ECOWAS nations have neither the troops available nor the will to fight in Niger, the threats have forced the Nigerien military to turn its attention to planning for an outside intervention rather than counterterror operations. ISIS is taking advantage of the situation, a YOU.S. defense official said. While ISIS has not been taking land in these attacks, it is trying to expand its reach into Niger and gain influence or power over local populations. The YOU.S. military believes there are currently fewer than 1,000 ISIS fighters inside Niger, but officials warn the numbers are very uncertain because of the vast parts of the country where the YOU.S. has no troops or intelligence gathering. The YOU.S. military is flying drones in Niger, primarily focused on areas where the US has troops or civilians, the officials said. Despite the coup, the YOU.S. still coordinates YOU.S. military movements with the Nigerien military for safety and security of YOU.S. troops. The Biden administration is still working through specifics about how the YOU.S. mission and footprint will change with a coup designation. The YOU.S. officials did not rule out possible YOU.S. unilateral counterterror missions into Niger in the future to target ISIS and other terror networks. After a coup determination, some YOU.S. troops and assets, like armed drones, could be moved elsewhere in the region to continue counterterror operations, the officials said, but declined to say where.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Biden administration is close to officially designating the overthrow of the country's elected government a coup.

Tobacco growing - the base from which Virginia was settled - is shrinking fast. There were just 306 Virginia tobacco farms in 2017, the latest year for which figures are available, down from 895 in 2007 and 6,067 in 1997. That was a year before the Master Tobacco Settlement in which tobacco companies agreed to pay states billions of dollars per year to settle state lawsuits that sought to recover health care costs related to tobacco illnesses. Tobacco was the leading cash crop in Virginia as late as 2003 before falling behind crops such as tomatoes, soybeans and corn. Tobacco no longer is among Virginia's top 10 agricultural products in cash receipts for farms, ranking far behind commodities such as chickens raised for meat production, cattle and calves, turkeys, dairy products and soybeans. But in 2022 tobacco products were among Virginia's top five agricultural and forestry exports at 215 million. Some 137 miles up the road, Altria Group's big Philip Morris USA plant in South Richmond makes billions of cigarettes in a plant the size of a football field, filled with a modern version of the nearly 150-year-old Bonsack machine that first mass produced cigarettes made out of that Old Belt leaf. Most of the tobacco those machines roll into the tubes of flimsy thin cigarettes that fly through their works is still from the Virginia and North Carolina Old Belt. Far fewer people smoke these days - 50 years ago, more than 4 out of 10 American adults smoked; these days, it is more like 1 out of 9. While the Richmond plant still churns out the nation's most popular cigarette - Marlboro, which accounts for more than 40 of the YOU.S. cigarette market and more than half of the largest, non-discount, segment of that market - it is also making Altria's new on! brand pouches of tobacco-derived nicotine. Altria CEO: 'We are not interested in attracting people to cigarettes' The plant will also run a pilot line of tobacco capsules that would be heated in a hand-held device similar to an e-cigarette. The capsules would deliver something that tastes more like a cigarette than vaping does, but it would not look as much like cigarettes as the new Marlboro-like sticks that the Richmond center will also make for Altria's joint venture with Japan Tobacco to market that firm's heating device with Marlboro-style sticks. Finding alternatives to burning tobacco in a cigarette - which generates more than 90 cancer-causing and toxic gases and particles - is where Henrico County-based Altria sees its future, chief executive office Billy Gifford told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. We are not interested in attracting people to cigarettes, Gifford says. What we know is about half of adult smokers are interested in an alternative, some way to safely enjoy tobacco. Public health advocates are skeptical. Many doubt Altria and other tobacco firms' promises that they want to make products that reduce the harm tobacco use causes. Some believe cigarette makers really want to increase the number of people addicted to the nicotine in tobacco. I think it is greenwashing, said Chris Bostic, policy director of Action on Smoking and Health. If they really wanted harm reduction, they would stop making combustibles. While the master settlement pushed cigarette prices higher, encouraging some smokers to quit, he said cigarette makers just turned to more effective marketing efforts, via social media. That also lowered the profile of a controversial industry to the wider world of those who do not smoke, easing public pressure on the companies. Virginians, including high school students, are more inclined to use tobacco than other Americans, according to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. It says 12.4 of adult Virginians smoke, compared with the national average of 11.5. It reports that 2.8 of Virginia high school students smoke and 11,100 minors a year try cigarettes. Health care costs in Virginia for smoking-related diseases total 3.6 billion annually, the campaign said. The 11.9 million Virginia spent on tobacco use prevention efforts was just 13 of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend. The shift in focus started with the Master Tobacco Settlement, 25 years old next month, under which Altria and other cigarette makers pay billions of dollars a year to states. Formally, the idea was to reimburse states for Medicaid programs' expenses in caring for smokers. In addition, the settlement forced up the price of a pack to levels that discouraged many smokers - and pulled back on ads and marketing efforts. The master settlement, it was really about saying to society we are going to reduce underage smoking, but with it we saw that the adult smoker was interested in alternatives. ... We have been at this for a while, Gifford said. The grower The tobacco world is changing. Thompson is one face of that. He is not a farm kid. And he only started raising tobacco 11 years ago - some seven years after many older growers in Virginia, as in other tobacco states, took the YOU.S. Department of Agriculture buyout of their quotas, a price support mechanism that in many cases their fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers acquired back in the 1930s, and stopped growing tobacco. Ending the quota ended the government-sponsored safety net: the Flue Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corp. It would buy tobacco at a price that aimed to cover growers' costs and the work they put in their crop if they could not get that at the warehouse auctions that were how leaf was sold. Ending the quota also ended the USDA's tobacco grading service - the impartial judges who could look at a 300-pound pile of leaf and set standardized ratings detailing stalk position - lugs, cutters, leaf of tips - color and body - the feel of a cured leaf that gave a good indication of sugar and nicotine content. These days, Thompson and other growers negotiate contracts directly with buyers. That usually happens around the time in February that Thompson and his helpers will be bent over ice cube-like trays of potting soil, carefully setting tiny pink tobacco seeds. It is finicky work. A line of 15 seeds will barely reach 18th of an inch. Contracting The contracts specify the pounds the grower is to deliver, and detail varieties to raise, and the stalk position - lugs, cutters, leaf or tips - the buyer wants. But when it is time to deliver, it is up to the buyer to say; he may say the color's not good, he does not like the body, the sugar or nicotine are not right, Thompson said. He may say he will not take it, he may offer you a reduced price. Buyers all have somewhat different preferences - and their preferences can evolve as they and their colleagues in other areas start bringing in tobacco. There is always a chance that bales that do not please one buyer a grower contracts with will be just the thing another is looking for. That is why Thompson, for instance, opted to arrange contracts with six different buyers this year. Some years, he gambled on raising more tobacco than he had contracts for, betting that the harvest in other tobacco growing areas might fall short - a hurricane hitting tobacco farms in the Carolinas in the big growing regions east of Interstate 95 could send buyers scrambling for leaf. But that is a big gamble, given a cost of about 5,000 an acre to raise tobacco on the Old Belt. There is special fertilizer, the cost of running his cultivar with its spiders - think rimless spoked wheels - to pull and cover weeds, and above all the wages growers pay people to pull leaf. Labor is 65 of a typical grower's cost. For the most part, those wages go to seasonal workers admitted for temporary stays with an H2A visa, with minimum wages dictated by the YOU.S. Department of Labor. This year, for people working in Virginia fields, they rose by just over 5 to 14.91; over the past five years, they have increased by nearly 22. Thompson opts for people to pick his leaf instead of the mechanical harvesters some growers use.

You get a lot cleaner bale, too - no weeds or trash - and buyers want clean. Growers can likely gross about 5,500 an acre from tobacco. As a margin over costs, it is not way out of line with soybeans raised on Old Belt soil - but beans might gross a farmer 500. Farms in Southside Virginia simply are not big enough for that kind of gross income per acre to yield enough money for anyone to be a full-time farmer. Shrinking As the number of Virginia growers and the acreage planted fell in the 25 years after the master settlement, the value of what they sold fell to 107.6 million from 187.4 million - but the average gross for the small number of growers who kept raising tobacco rose to 352,000 from just under 32,000. Margins are squeezed, though. Under the settlement, from 1998 to 2022 cigarette makers had paid 159 billion and those payments are to continue as long as the companies sell tobacco products. States were free to use the funds as they chose, though the settlement urged them to step up spending on tobacco control and prevention programs. Last year, states used about 11 of the 6.38 billion of settlement payments they received for prevention and control efforts. Virginia has so far received more than 3 billion. It used the promise of future payments to issue bonds, and invested the proceeds. Half of the income from those investments funds the state's Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission's efforts to ease the impact of falling tobacco sales on farmers and the towns that long depended on tobacco growers' income. The commission paid growers some 479 million to compensate them for losses they suffered as the YOU.S. Department of Agriculture cut tobacco quotas - the limits on the amount of tobacco they could sell - before USDA ended the program altogether by buying back quotas for 7 a pound (with 3 more for growers who held quotas). Many producers used the money to pay off debt and keep their farms running while they shifted to other crops - but the big notion that they could grow vegetables never really panned out. The processing, distribution and marketing systems that are needed to attract interest from supermarket chains did not come. On top of that, soils in the Old Belt are not the most fertile. That is good for tobacco, because it forces the plant to ripen quickly once its white or lavender-colored flowers are pulled off - topped as growers say. Other crops do not do as well. Fewer cigarettes Growing tobacco is shrinking. So is smoking. The fraction of American adults who smoke cigarettes fell to 12.5 as of 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An additional 3.7 used e-cigarettes, 2.3 used smokeless tobacco - dip, snuff or snus - and 3.5 smoked cigars. Just 2 of high school students smoked cigarettes. In 1997, 37.7 of high school boys and 34.7 of girls smoked cigarettes - more than double those numbers had tried it at some point, CDC reports show. But vaping is popular: 14.1 of high school students use e-cigarettes - devices that often use synthetic nicotine rather than the tobacco-derived compound. The year before the settlement, American tobacco companies sold 478.6 billion cigarettes, down sharply from the 1981 peak of 636.5 billion. But by 2020, the latest year for which data are available, sales had dropped to 203.7 billion, the Federal Trade Commission reported. The way the companies market cigarettes changed dramatically, too. Promotional allowances - basically, price discounts - already the biggest marketing expense in 1997, the year before the settlement, at 2.44 billion, have climbed to 7.47 billion. Meanwhile, the public presence of cigarettes almost disappeared. The companies stopped spending on sponsorships, endorsements, entertainment events, sampling and advertising in newspapers, while magazine advertising fell to 4.3 million from 237 million, billboards to 1.8 million from 295.3 million. Spending on point-of-sale store displays fell from 552.6 million to 47.1 million. The 1,600-strong field sales force at Henrico County-based tobacco giant Altria, manufacturer of the nation's No. 1 cigarette brand, Marlboro, who regularly visit stores with ideas for selling cigarettes, have also convinced 197,000 retailers to sign contracts requiring them to post We Card signs. The signs warn buyers they may have to prove they are over 21 if they want to buy cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars or oral tobacco. Altria signed up more than 137,000 stores for a scanner and software system based on an electronic scan of a consumer's government-issued identification, such as a driver's license, to purchase any tobacco product. When a sales clerk scans a tobacco product for a sale, the system requires a scan of a driver's license or similar ID before the transaction can continue. The scanner includes software that can confirm that the ID has not expired and that buyer is over 21. Making cigarettes - and other items At Altria's Richmond Manufacturing Center, its 1,700 employees are not only running the machines that make 75 billion Marlboro cigarettes a year. They also produce more than 90 of one of the new products - on!, pouches with tobacco-derived nicotine and plant fiber, said Scott Myers, president and chief executive officer of Altria Group Sales and Distribution Co. A pilot line at the plant is making parts for another smoke-free product Altria is developing: a handheld device, called SWIC, that looks much like a vaping device, but that will heat a capsule of tobacco, inside of a liquid with either tobacco-derived or artificial nicotine, the addictive ingredient in tobacco plants. Those capsules are what the Richmond pilot line is making. SWIC is meant to appeal to tobacco users who want to inhale a stronger tobacco flavor than vaping liquids now deliver, but that does not look like a cigarette, which Altria thinks will appeal to smokers who might feel embarrassed when others see them smoking, or who worry others will be offended by that stale smell of smoke. Compared with cigarettes, SWIC prototypes are delivering low levels of the 93 chemicals that because cancer or lung disease, the company says. Altria scientists, engineers and marketers are still working on last-minute refinements to the device, but I think we are really close to delivering a final product, Altria chief operating officer Jody Begley has said. Altria, meanwhile, expects to file with the Food and Drug Administration in 2025 for preliminary permission to market a Richmond-made, Marlboro-based stick to be used with a heating device that Japan Tobacco has developed. The two tobacco giants have formed a joint venture to market a system comprising pint-sized cigarettes that fit into a handheld heating device. The idea here is to have a product that offers smokers some of the sensory signals that cigarettes do - the tapping of a cigarette on the pack, for instance, that for many is the preliminary to that first deep drag that the heated sticks also provide. Because the stick is heated, rather than burned, it does not create some of the chemicals and toxic carbon monoxide that cigarette smoke contains, Altria says. By pairing Japan Tobacco's device, already for sale in its market, with Marlboro-brand sticks, Begley says it should appeal to smokers who might be hesitant about trying something new. Flue-cured leaf Heated sticks mean opportunity for Old Belt growers, because they would need the same high-quality flue-cured or bright tobacco grown along the Virginia-North Carolina line - and maybe even proportionally more, said Stephen Barts, a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent specializing in tobacco. Combustible cigarettes often use blends that include lower-quality leaf because Old Belt flue-cured tobacco can mask the taste of that leaf, whether imported from Brazil, Zimbabwe, Zambia or Malawi or from growers farther south on the lighter soils of coastal plain North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, Barts said. But heated tobacco sticks are smaller than cigarettes and use less tobacco overall. Bright tobacco makes up about three quarters of the leaf in an American-style cigarette and all of the leaf in British or Canadian-style brands. American-style cigarettes also use burley tobacco, a variety still grown in Southwest Virginia but mainly in Kentucky, and oriental style leaf, which is usually imported from Turkey or the Balkans. Oral tobacco and the advanced products, such as pouches, use a different kind of tobacco, like the dark air-cured and dark fire-cured leaf that is still grown in Charlotte County. As fewer Americans smoke, and with dark tobacco in demand for two of the main alternatives to cigarettes - oral tobacco and pouches, overseas buying of flue-cured tobacco - from China, notably - has become the mainstay of Old Belt growers, Barts said. We are an export market, he said. There are more smokers in China than people in the United States. Vaping advice: How to help kids dodge cigarette, vaping, and pot marketing and stay smoke-free  Whether or not you smoke cigarettes or support legalizing marijuana, you probably do not want your kids lighting up. But the rise of e-cigs vaporizers like the Juul, and decriminalized pot may make your standard anti-smoking arguments -- it causes cancer, it is illegal -- feel a little shaky. Add in celebrities posting pictures of themselves smoking various substances, and you might wonder: Is it possible to raise drug-free, smoke-free kids in the era of Smoking 2.0? Yes, but it helps to have a little ammunition. Vaping is an especially tough one, because kids encounter tons of information about it online. According to a November 2019 survey conducted by Common Sense Media and SurveyMonkey: Vaping is popular among teens, and it is happening regularly at school. One-third of teens (33) say they see classmates vaping in school a few times a week or daily. More than half (54) say they see it monthly. Nearly eight in 10 (78) say vaping is popular among people their age where they live. Most teens think vaping is as harmful as smoking. Just over half of teens (52) say vaping is about as harmful as smoking, while 31 say it is more harmful and 17 say it is less harmful. Among those teens who say vaping is less harmful than smoking, 43 say they have gotten messages online telling them that vaping is healthier than smoking cigarettes. One in four teens first learned about vaping on social media. A plurality of teens (44) say they first learned or heard about vaping from someone they know, while 23 first heard about it on social media, 9 from TV or a movie, and less than that from outdoor ads, in a store, on a website, on the radio, or on a podcast. Vaping is common in teens' social media experiences. When thinking about their typical experience using social media, 59 of teens say they are likely to see a post that mentions or shows vaping. If you are feeling outspent, out-messaged, and out-cooled, take heart. There are plenty of ways to fight back. Here is how to help your kids resist the marketing of traditional cigarettes, vaporizers, e-cigs, and pot. TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES -- Explain how bad smoking is for you. Kids think they are immune and immortal. The death statistics could be eye-opening, even for the it will not happen to me age group. -- Talk about how addictive nicotine is. Nicotine is really difficult to quit. Discuss the signs of physical addiction and the risk of getting addicted. -- Help them resist gimmicks. Traditional cigarettes are trying to capture smoker interest by using kid-friendly tricks -- for example, the Camel Crush cigarettes with a menthol ball inside. But the cigarettes still really are bad for you. Explain that Big Tobacco just wants to addict you. When cigarette smoking declined, tobacco companies such as Altria bought the vaping company Juul. VAPORIZORS AND E-CIGS -- Share the facts. E-cigarettes and vapes reduce exposure to some of the harmful chemicals of tobacco cigarettes, but no one really knows the impact of these products on kids' health. And studies show they contain formaldehyde. -- Tell them to wait. Tell them it is important that they wait until their brains and bodies have developed fully before they consume something potentially harmful. -- Talk about addiction. Kids can get hooked on nicotine but also on the physical habit of reaching for a pipe. -- Get your doctor involved. Have your pediatrician talk to your kid about the dangers of ingesting any chemical you do not know much about. -- Help them see through the hype. Talk about marketing methods such as using celebrities and how companies try to make e-cigs seem as though they are healthier and better for the environment than tobacco cigarettes. -- Cite the death statistics. Dozens of people have died from vaping -- and many more have become sick. MARIJUANA Impart your values. Teens are still listening to their parents, despite much evidence to the contrary. Discuss what is important to you: good character, solid judgment, and belief in a bright future -- all of which are compromised by smoking pot. -- Explain the health consequences. Study after study indicates that pot negatively affects a teen's developing brain. -- Encourage waiting. For some kids, forbidding might backfire, so focus on preventing them from starting to smoke in the first place, delaying it as long as possible. -- Look for warning signs. Be on the lookout for things that might be affecting your kid in other areas of his or her life -- for example, social exclusion, school problems, and emotional instability. -- Pull back the curtain on pot marketing. Kids and teens do not like to be tricked, and advertising is full of sneaky ways to get people to buy a product, including branding pot products with names such as Bob Marley and Willie Nelson. Instead of lecturing, help your kids break down the ads to see how they try to influence emotions, choices, and behavior.

Marina Ovsyannikova made headlines last year when she walked onto the set of Russia's Channel One with a sign that said No war and They are lying to you here. She was sentenced in absentia on Wednesday to 8 years and 6 months in a Russian penal colony, a statement released by the Moscow prosecutor's office said. The Basmanny District Court in Moscow charged Ovsyannikova for spreading false information about the Russian army during a demonstration she staged last year about the war in Ukraine, unrelated to her on-air protest. Ovsyannikova, who is living in France under political asylum, called the charges absurd and politically motivated. I do not admit my guilt and I do not go back on a single word, said Ovsyannikova in a statement addressed to the court on Telegram. I have made a very difficult, but the only correct moral choice in my life and have already paid a fairly high price for it. On a live stream by the channel Zhivoy Gvozd on Thursday, Ovsyannikova said the false information charge refers to a protest she staged on a river embankment opposite the Kremlin last year. She held a sign stating that 352 children had died in Ukraine, information she said was posted on the UN's website, and could be looked at by any Russian citizen. Russian courts call this information about the number of children killed fake because it is not posted on the website of the Ministry of Defense. Therefore, criminal charges were brought against me, said Ovsyannikova on the live stream. Ovsyannikova may have been referring to a UN General Assembly session on Ukraine in February 2022, where it was announced that 352 Ukrainian civilians, including 16 children, had been killed. In August this year, the UN confirmed that at least 9,444 civilians have been killed in the Ukraine conflict, including 545 children. On the live stream, the 45-year-old activist said that she is living in France under political asylum after fleeing house arrest in Russia with her 11-year-old daughter last year. She said she is had a difficult time trying to find housing and work for the past six months. When you have an emergency emigration, you flee Russia with one suitcase, Ovsyannikova said. Everything that I had in Russia was taken away from me. And, so, living in France without money, without work, and without documents is quite a difficult test. Ovsyannikova was hired in November at German newspaper WELT. She said she left after 3 months, and was told to look for a bigger publication to provide her with the necessary security. WELT confirmed that Ovsyannikova's contract had expired, but did not comment on the circumstances of her departure. We continue to have the greatest respect for Ms. Ovsyannikova's courage and courage and wish her all the best, said a spokesperson from WELT. In a news release Wednesday, France's Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs denounced Ovsyannikova's sentencing and commended her activism efforts. France is very concerned by the intensification of the campaign of repression carried out by the Russian authorities against voices critical of the government and its war of aggression against Ukraine, the statement said. According to the court sentencing, Ovsyannikova is on the international wanted list in Russia. She has been fined and interrogated multiple times for her activism efforts. After her on-air protest, she was interrogated for more than 14 hours and fined 30,000 rubles for hooliganism. On the Zhivoy Gvozd livestream, Ovsyannikova said members of her family, including her mother and 18-year-old son, testified against her in court. Her ex-husband, who she said is an employee on the RussiaToday TV channel, filed a lawsuit against her to deprive her of parental rights. The Russian correctional colonies where Ovsyannikova would serve her sentence have been associated with multiple human rights abuses, including overcrowding, abuse by guards, and inadequate health care access. WNBA Basketball star Brittney Griner served a 10-month term in a Russian penal colony and described the experience as unfathomable. According to a statement by the Moscow Prosecutor's office, Ovsyannikova would also be deprived of her right to use the internet and other telecommunication networks for 4 years. Only 0.25 percent of all cases sent through the Russian judicial system ended with not guilty verdicts, according to the Independent.

Politico first reported that McCarthy was considering resigning. McCarthy was removed as House speaker on Tuesday in a 216-210 vote, with Democrats joining eight conservatives frustrated with his leadership in voting to oust him. Hours after the vote, McCarthy announced during a press conference that he would not run again for the top post in the House.

A second person, who has not spoken to McCarthy directly but is in touch with people in his inner circle, said, His thinking has vacillated a bit. I think he is considered multiple options. And what it means for his future. He said it in his remarks -- he wants to help keep most of the members in their seats. How he does that and from what vantage point is the decision, the person said. McCarthy would not be the first former speaker to leave Congress before their term was over. Then-Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, left Congress before the end of his term after suddenly announcing his decision in September 2015 to step down. McCarthy, 58, has served in House GOP leadership since 2009 and has served in Congress since 2007. He represents California's 20th congressional district, which covers the state's Central Valley. He took over as speaker in January after a chaotic effort initially within the GOP conference to elect him and he lasted nine months in the job. McCarthy has served as the top Republican leader since 2019 after the resignation of Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Before coming to Washington, he was a member of the California State Assembly. The idea that McCarthy might leave Capitol Hill before his term is up at the beginning of 2025 comes just days before House Republicans are slated to hold a candidate forum for speaker behind closed doors on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they are expected to hold an internal election within the House GOP Conference before the election is moved to the House floor for an official vote. As of Friday afternoon, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had launched official bids for speaker. Jordan has so far received more public support than Scalise and Jordan received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump on Thursday. Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, is also debating jumping into the race for the gavel.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"McCarthy was removed as House speaker on Tuesday in a 216-210 vote.

They are reporting that an inspection of the vessel the Kafkametler showed no damage and that there was no injury to the crew. The explosion in question did not occur on the ship and there was no evidence of a mine explosion, the General Directorate of Maritime Affairs of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure for Turkey wrote in an online statement. They denied the media reports saying that they had been in touch with the vessel and that there was no contact with a mine. On Thursday, the reports said that the Kafkametler had struck a mine approximately 11 miles north of Sulina in Romania. The 3,100 dwt vessel registered in Turkey and operated by Kafkametler Maritime is 31 years old and reported inbound with an unidentified cargo. The Turkish authorities reported it was sailing from Batumi to Izmail, but due to congestion had slowed before entering the Sulina Canal. The Turkish authorities are contending that an explosion occurred 15 to 20 meters behind the vessel. They are not identifying the because of the explosion but other reports are suggesting it was an old bottom mine but that it was at some distance from the vessel when the explosion occurred. Ukraine's spokesperson for the Naval Forces, Dmytro Pletenchuk also commented on a local radio report. He confirmed as had been reported by security consultancy Ambrey that the vessel had briefly anchored. He said that they had conducted an inspection and found no damage. This differed from previous reports that said there was some damage to the vessel's ballast tank. Pletenchuk called the reports false. The ship's captain and the shipping company later also asserted that the vessel was not struck by a mine. They said after confirming that there was no damage the Kafkametler had proceeded to Izmail. The Turkish ministry reports the vessel's cargo was transferred to Ukraine as planned. The incident comes at a sensitive time as Pletenchuk reported at the beginning of the week as many as 12 more merchant ships were preparing to sail for Ukraine.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom is on the way to Israel for discussions with locals and officials following recent incidents in the Middle East. I will be meeting with those impacted by the horrific terrorist attacks and offering California's support, Mr. Newsom wrote October 19 on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr. Newsom's office declined to comment, and other than the social media post, no official statement or press release was issued regarding the surprise trip. It is unclear how long the governor will be in the Middle East or if he will return to California before traveling to China for a week-long trip, where he is scheduled to lead a delegation starting October 23. With several stops planned around the country, the group will meet with local officials to discuss climate initiatives and economic partnerships. The governor noted the trip will follow through on prior commitments and collaborations with China and will help expedite the state's environmental goals. Our decades-long work together proves what we can accomplish together -- cleaning the air, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, protecting people from extreme weather and conserving lands and oceans, Mr. Newsom said. The trip will have gatherings between national, subnational and business partners to address climate action, promote tourism and economic development, and discuss methods to highlight cultural ties and reduce incidents of xenophobia, in this case, anti-Asian hate. China welcomes Governor Gavin Newsom and his delegation to visit China and hopes the visit will bolster California's exchanges and cooperation with China, a spokesperson for the Chinese government posted also October 19 on X. While visiting the region, the delegation will be advancing its commitment to competition, innovation, and inclusivity while bringing together the second- and fifth-largest economies in the world, according to the press release. Recognizing the long-standing ties that unite the two regions, with the Golden State home to the largest number of Chinese Americans -- 32 percent of YOU.S. immigrants from China reside in California -- and history dating back more than 150 years, the group seeks to find common ground and mutually beneficial solutions. Mr. Newsom will be delivering a message stressing the need for urgent action to address climate issues, according to the press release. During the seven-day journey, the governor will make stops in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and the province of Jiangsu. Beginning in Hong Kong, the delegation will meet with leadership from Hong Kong University -- similar in structure to the University of California system -- to discuss climate change efforts and economic partnership opportunities. In Guangdong province, the governor is expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding -- a cooperative agreement -- with local leaders regarding climate change goals and initiatives. The group will also study the City of Shenzen -- with a population of approximately 13 million -- and its transition in 2018 to all-electric bus fleets consisting of 16,000 buses and 40,000 chargers. While visiting Beijing, the capital of China, the governor is scheduled to sign more climate agreements, discuss economic development, and strengthen cultural ties -- with talks slated with leaders from five provinces representing nearly a quarter of China's population, though no mention was made if a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping is planned. The group plans to visit the Great Wall, meet with embassy staff and officials, and tour a farm-to-school program designed to benefit rural communities. In the province of Jiangsu, the governor will sign another climate goal memorandum, explore the largest offshore wind operation in the world -- in preparation for efforts to utilize such technologies off the coast of California -- and tour a wetlands preserve to discuss climate strategies. High-speed rail -- transportation the governor envisions for California -- will then take the delegation to Shanghai, where Mr. Newsom will sign the fifth memorandum agreement of the trip with local officials and tour Tesla's gigafactory -- a massive electric vehicle factory reportedly the most productive in the world. The governor's tour comes just weeks before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit -- scheduled for the week of November 12 in San Francisco, California. With the city experiencing unique public safety issues due to shoplifting, homelessness, and drug abuse on its streets, the YOU.S. Secret Service and San Francisco Police Department held a joint press conference October 18 to address concerns and steps in preparation for the event -- including a declaration allowing federal agencies to oversee policing activities, the first such occurrence in California.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"California Gov.

Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during the second Republican debate on Sept. 27.Mike Blake  Reuters file Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is telling Republicans that he is in an existential fight against former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley -- without telling them that. The two candidates have emerged as the leading alternatives to former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination -- a position DeSantis once held alone. For several days, they have been engaged in a heated exchange over the unfolding war in the Middle East, with DeSantis on Thursday reiterating a debunked charge that Haley wants to admit Palestinian refugees to the YOU.S. But the skirmish may be noteworthy less for the substance than for what it says about the state of a race in which Trump is still the dominant figure, according to Republican strategists who are not affiliated with either campaign. For months, DeSantis and his allies have contended that the governor was in a two-man battle with Trump for the nomination. Their new focus on Haley betrays a different concern: that DeSantis is locked in a fight with her for second place. This is much more about momentum and whose arrow is pointing up and whose arrow is pointing down, said Matthew Bartlett, a national Republican strategist and New Hampshire native. I think they are trying to blunt any further growth, rise or momentum for Haley in order to try to maintain the No. 2 position. South Carolina state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, who has endorsed DeSantis, said the showdown between DeSantis and Haley always felt like it was coming. I always felt like this was going to happen a Haley-DeSantis clash, Kimbrell said. This is all about who will be able to survive when the herd is thinned. He added that he did think the dust-up over whether Haley wants to allow Palestinian refugees into the YOU.S. would hurt her with primary voters. She has said she does not want to admit Palestinian refugees, a charge stemming a CNN interview in which she said you can separate civilians from terrorists while discussing a blanket statement DeSantis had made about Gaza. Both candidates trail Trump by yawning margins in national and state-by-state polling, with DeSantis currently running second in Iowa and Haley holding that spot in New Hampshire and South Carolina. But their relative proximity to each other, at a time when several other candidates have faded, is a result of Haley gaining steam and DeSantis losing it over the course of the campaign. DeSantis has had more resources, but Nikki Haley has something that you cannot buy that he never really had: momentum, said Vinny Minchillo, a longtime GOP operative based in Texas. That momentum can be seen in her rise in the polls and in the two candidates' fundraising. After collecting 5.3 million in the second quarter of the year, Haley's campaign posted an 8.2 million haul in a third-quarter report filed with the Federal Election Commission Sunday. DeSantis has outraised Haley, but his trajectory is in the opposite direction: 20.1 million in the second quarter and 11.1 million in the third quarter. Perhaps most important on the financial front, Haley has been more efficient with her cash and has more to spend on the run-up to early-state voting, ending September with 9.1 million in available funds for the primary, compared to DeSantis' 5 million. Never Back Down, the pro-DeSantis super PAC which clocked 130 million raised and 96.8 million left in the bank when its last disclosure was due in July, gives DeSantis' side a major cash edge over the rest of the field. Some of it is being spent now to try to reverse Haley's surge and return DeSantis to sole possession of second place. On Thursday, the super PAC began running an ad in Iowa and New Hampshire that strongly and falsely suggests that Haley is open to the YOU.S. admitting Palestinian refugees amid Israel's war with Hamas. The ad piggybacks on DeSantis' argument in an exclusive interview with NBC News earlier this week that Haley has been trying to please the media and people on the left in her remarks on the war in the Middle East. Responding on CNN to a DeSantis claim that all Palestinians in Gaza are antisemitic, Haley said Sunday that Americans should care about the Palestinian citizens and have always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists. DeSantis said Thursday that it is fair game to attack her for supporting refugees because her use of the word separate indicated that she wanted to vet Palestinians for entry into the YOU.S. Why would you be vetting people if you are not going to be bringing them in? he said. More broadly, DeSantis allies are trying to draw a contrast in which Republican primary voters see DeSantis as more of a hard-liner than Haley on immigration and national security policy. It remains to be seen whether Never Back Down will air more Haley-focused ads, but a senior official for the super PAC said her rise has set her up for a fall. She is about to go through her scrutiny and decline phase, the official said. Haley's team foresees no change in the candidates' respective trajectories, according to one aide, who said Haley has replaced DeSantis in a two-person race against Trump. She has just been slow, consistent, steady, and she is rising now, the Haley aide said. And DeSantis has gone nowhere but down.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Florida Gov.

While they are saying the targets were unclear, they noted the weapons were heading north and could well have been aimed at Israel. An analysis is ongoing. CNN broke the story this afternoon of the potential attack reporting that evidence showed the missiles and drones had been launched from Yemen. They were believed to be coming from the areas controlled by the Houthi rebels, although the Pentagon would not confirm who was suspected of launching the weapons. We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters as part of a briefing in which he described the YOU.S.'s ongoing efforts to support Israel. A total of three missiles were taken down along with an unspecified number of drones. All of them were reported to be over the Red Sea and heading north from Yemen when the order was given to intercept them. The Pentagon does not believe any of the weapons were aimed at the Carney, which conducted the intercept, or any other YOU.S. assets in the area. Analysts are however noting that the distance between Yemen and Israel would be at the upper limits of the capabilities of the missiles that were shot down. This action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we built in the Middle East and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interest in this important region, Ryder told the reporters in the briefing which was also broadcast live over the Internet. USS Carney transiting the Suez Canal yesterday, October 18 (US Navy photo) The Carney, which had been operating with the Gerald R. Ford Strike Group, had just arrived in the northern Red Sea shortly before the incident. The guided-missile destroyer repositioned from the Eastern Mediterranean with the US Navy confirming yesterday, October 18 the vessel had transited the Suez Canal. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, the YOU.S. Navy said is deployed to the YOU.S. 5th Fleet area of operations. They said it was being used to help ensure maritime security and stability in the Middle East region. The positioning of the Carney in the Red Sea comes as the YOU.S. Navy has been repositioning assets in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group was redeployed to the Eastern Mediterranean on October 10 just three days after the brutal attack on Israel by Hamas. The strike group consists of the Ford, Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, and USS Roosevelt, in addition to the USS Carney. Two days ago, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Strike Group also arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean. Reports are that the carrier is traveling with the cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the destroyers USS Gravely and USS Mason. In addition, the Pentagon reported sending the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) and the amphibs USS Carter Hall and USS Bataan to the Eastern Mediterranean followed by reports that the YOU.S. 6th Fleet command ship, USS Mount Whitney, was joining the growing flotilla off the Israeli coast.

Both elections are in traditionally safe Tory seats, but Sunak's press secretary has warned of difficult local circumstances, setting expectations for a tough night. Labour has also played down its prospects in the super safe Tory seats of Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire, but polling suggests they will be disappointed not to win at least one when the results are announced in the early hours of Friday. The Mid Bedfordshire poll was called when former culture secretary Nadine Dorries, a loyalist to former prime minister Boris Johnson who blames Sunak for his political downfall, quit her seat. She accused the new prime minister of having abandoned the fundamental principles of conservatism. The Tamworth poll was triggered when Chris Pincher, who had the seat since 2010, quit after being found to have groped two men in an egregious case of sexual misconduct. Johnson's handling of the case led to raft of ministerial resignations that spelt the beginning of the end of his premiership. The Tories won Mid Bedfordshire, which it has held since 1931, by a thumping 24,664 votes and Tamworth by a 19,600 majority in the 2019 general election. But it saw a 20,000 majority overturned in a July by-election on a 21 percent swing and Labour have been leading national polls by more than 10 points for over a year, throwing Friday's results into the balance. - Policy shifts - Sunak has recently made a number of policy shifts including cancelling part of a costly high-speed rail link and delaying policies aimed at helping the UK achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Despite the shifts, his party has seen little improvement in the polls and defeat in either by-election make the prospect of another Tory victory at the next national vote seem more remote. Ahead of polls opening on Thursday, Sunak's press secretary told reporters that mid-term by-elections are extremely tough for incumbent governments. Labour, meanwhile, said that neither seat was on our target list for the general election. If we were to win Tamworth and had that swing at a general election, it would mean that the Tories will be down to fewer than 60 seats at the next general election, said a spokesman. The Tories currently have more than 350 MPs in the House of Commons.

The results are expected to be announced in the early hours of Friday. The Tamworth poll was triggered when Chris Pincher, who had the seat since 2010, quit after being found to have groped two men in an egregious case of sexual misconduct. Nadine Dorries, a loyalist to former PM Boris Johnson who blames Sunak for his political downfall, quit her seat. She accused the new PM of having abandoned the fundamental principles of conservatism."

His mother always had a hunch that he was murdered by suspected Indiana serial killer Herbert Baumeister. This week, Livingston's family finally got closure. Livingston's DNA was matched to a sample from remains found on Baumeister's estate at Fox Hollow Farm, said the Hamilton County Coroner's Office. Eight bodies were identified on the property when the case was opened in 1996, but DNA technology was not advanced enough to identify the other remains at the time. Hearing about Allen was a little rollercoaster of feelings, said Eric Pranger, Livingston's cousin, who requested that the case be reopened last year. We are happy because we got closure and we were able to identify him, but sad because we had to relive it a bit. Investigators believe Baumeister frequented gay bars to lure men to his home and kill them. He is been linked to the disappearance of at least 16 men since 1980. The 49-year-old killed himself in July 1996 before investigators had a chance to question him, leaving families like Livingston's with no answers. Pranger said Livingston's mother lost hope of finding her son over the years because every time she would call to check on his case, there was no new information. He said Sharon Livingston had always had a gut feeling that her son was at Fox Hollow Farms - a feeling Pranger called a mother's intuition. When the case was reopened, she submitted a DNA sample to the coroner's office. Last year, she told NBC affiliate WTHR that the search for her son had become more urgent to her after she was diagnosed with cancer. I do not have my son's remains, and until I have that, it will be unfinished for me and I hope I get them before I pass away, Sharon told WTHR last November. She finally has those remains. Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison called Sharon Livingston on Monday to let her know her son had been identified. He said a leg bone from Allen Livingston was one of 44 remains in the first batch his team submitted for DNA testing. What are the odds that of our first identification from 10,000 pieces of bone would be to that family that made the initial call? said Jellison. Livingston's bones were in the first batch of remains chosen for DNA testing. Investigators still do not know how many individuals will be identified. University of Indianapolis forensic anthropologist Dr. Krista Latham helped determine which remains had the best chance of producing a DNA profile to submit to the state police lab. When the remains were recovered in 1996, DNA technology was expensive and far more rudimentary. It required a large volume of skeletal material and tests were not as individualizing as they are today, Latham said. Her lab has been involved with the case since the initial excavation. Today's DNA technology -- which uses nuclear rather than mitochondrial DNA -- is much more sensitive and can use very small samples of skeletal materials to generate very individualizing profiles. It is that increased sensitivity in the DNA technology that is really allowed for us to investigate skeletal material in a way that was not possible before, said Latham. She said another portion of the remains are difficult to identify even with today's technological capabilities, mostly because they were burned or crushed prior to recovery. Some are as small as a fingernail. Four other DNA profiles were also identified in the same batch as Livingston's, but they cannot be matched to a missing person because of a lack of reference samples from family members. Jellison, Latham, and Pranger are encouraging other families who had loved ones go missing from the 1980s to mid-'90s to to provide samples for the investigation. It will keep your mind from wondering where your loved one really is, said Pranger. Instead you will have solid proof that they have been found. All the remains are being preserved in a temperature-controlled secure evidence room at the University of Indianapolis' Anthropology and Archaeology Department, where they have been for the past 27 years. This first identification is important, but what it taught us is that what we are doing is right, said Jellison. Now it is time to get our nose back to the grindstone because we know now that we can produce some results.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Allen Livingston, 27, went missing in 1993.

This growth would create 100,000 jobs and generate an additional R20bn in annual revenue. But if the transportation infrastructure is already under pressure and has become a serious headache for growers, how on earth will our overburdened roads, underutilised rail networks and congested ports handle the enormous increase of 100-million cartons per year in the coming years? Urgently improving the freight rail system is the only real answer to the problem. Our roads are struggling. We see it in the decaying state of rural roads, in the arson attacks on trucks that made headlines this season and in the bottlenecks experienced on highways. We need to increase freight rail to take pressure off our roads and to handle the increased citrus production we are expecting. More freight rail transport will not only introduce much-needed competition in the transport of fresh produce, but will lessen the disastrous effects of truck attacks and protests. The N3 between Gauteng and the Durban port is an essential artery that can be severed far too easily, as we have unfortunately seen in the past few years. The data on transport demand supports the argument for increased freight rail. Let us suppose nothing substantial changes in the country's logistics set-up and we have to export just more than 200-million cartons in 2027. What would truck density on our roads be like then? In one word: frightening. If we calculate, as an example, the collective growth in transport demand for the northern production regions, peak season weekly trips will go from the current 2,200 truck trips a week to well more than 3,800 truck trips a week. And that is obviously just for citrus. It is an enormous increase that our roads simply cannot handle. To keep the peak road transport demand balanced against the growth forecast for the northern regions, a total of 18,000 pallets per week will need to be transported from the northern regions to the ports by rail. Since the only viable option to transport citrus by rail is to run containers on reefer trains, this means a minimum of 900 reefer containers will need to be railed to port. This is about 20 train trips a week to Maputo, Durban and Cape Town. It is a huge undertaking, but ultimately there is no other choice since we do not expect the supply of road transport to balance the potential growth in demand before 2027. Many are probably raising their eyebrows knowing that the rail networks are struggling with no solution in sight. They will point to the recent exodus of leaders at Transnet. They will also point to cable theft that leaves rail lines inoperable on an almost daily basis. They will point to all the dilapidated locomotives. But we cannot afford to allow Transnet to slide into total chaos. There is a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. We need to focus on the projects that work, and expand from there. The all-important rail line between Durban and Gauteng, commonly known as the Container Corridor, is being put out to private sector participation. The 20-year Container Corridor operating lease will require investment in the rehabilitation, upgrade and maintenance of the rail network and rolling stock assets. The corridor could truly become a lifeline for our export economy again. But the clock is ticking and one can only hope the government realises how vital this partnership with the private sector is for the growth of our economy. There are other reasons to be cautiously optimistic about freight rail. A spark of hope is to be found in Bela-Bela, Limpopo. Since 2017 Kholwa Logistics has been running reefers on trains from Bela-Bela to Durban, with considerable success. Kholwa works closely with Transnet, and a group of citrus producers in the Groblersdal-Marble Hall area makes use of this freight option for their export citrus. In the season that has just come to an end these producers transported no fewer than 1,772 refrigerated containers. This line of transport from Bela-Bela has shown impressive growth in the years it has been operational, and clearly this project shows the potential of rail. The trick will be to enlarge these types of endeavour. Kholwa Logistics director Althea Thysen explains that part of the challenge is to get producers to trust rail again as a reliable option. She has considerable faith in the project, pointing out that demand is clearly there and it is a more cost-effective option for growers. When rail works, it works well. But the effort needs to be made to make it work again. Our ports will also need to be in shape to receive increased citrus from rail. Durban and Cape Town are among the world's worst ports. They are listed in the bottom 10 of the 348 ranked by the World Bank's latest Container Port Performance index. There is a glimmer of hope in the recent announcement by Transnet of a private sector participation project at the Durban port. Philippines-based multinational International Container Terminal Services will run and expand Durban's Pier 2, the largest container terminal on the continent. The deal is the first port joint venture by Transnet and one hopes many will follow, for instance in Gqeberha. Also heartening are recent news reports of a plan -- originating in the presidency -- to overhaul Transnet's freight offering through far greater private sector involvement. This plan needs to be more than another turnaround document. The hope is that all stakeholders will realise that a rail renaissance simply must take place. Without it SA will unavoidably forfeit a large amount of the forecast job growth in citrus, and in many other industries as well. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Local citrus industry could increase its exports by 100-million 15kg cartons by 2032.

Nam Y. Huh  AP In prime-time remarks to the nation Thursday night, President Joe Biden made a point of singling out Wadea Al-Fayoume, the six-year-old Palestinian-American boy viciously stabbed to death in what authorities have charged as a hate crime. His name is Wadea, Biden said. He went on to condemn the attack, said America should not stand for Islamophobia and addressed the Arab and Muslim communities suffering under the weight of hate. He also took a moment to tell Israel not to be blinded by rage, as it carries out its retaliation in Gaza. Immediately afterward, he called the Al-Fayoume's family, speaking to both his father and uncle. Hanaan Shahin, Al-Fayoume's mother, was also stabbed more than a dozen times in the attack and is expected to survive. The White House said the president and the first lady expressed their condolences to the family and expressed their commitment to speaking out against anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim bigotry. Biden's remarks, and the call, followed direct outreach from the White House earlier this week to the family of the boy, according to his uncle, Mahmood Yosif, who has served as a spokesperson to the family of the slain boy. Yosif said told NBC News that the White House talked to a family representative earlier this week to express the president's condolences. A White House official said the president expressed his deepest condolences through multiple calls between the administration and family representatives. The official said White House staff also asked if the family consented to the president bringing up Al-Fayoume in public statements. The family's landlord, who prosecutors say targeted the boy and his mother because of their Muslim faith, was charged in the slaying. On Thursday, before the president's speech, Yosif said the family appreciated outreach from the White House, he said he remained frustrated overall with the president because he said Biden was giving more attention to the matter overseas and not enough to what is happening domestically, particularly with hate crimes against Muslims. I want our president to come out and say, 'You are number one, I work for the people of this country,' Yosif said. Others expressed frustration with the president for not personally calling the family. Biden's personal address to Muslims and Arab-Americans comes as he faced seething frustration from the Muslim and Arab communities in the YOU.S., over what they called an uneven response since atrocities in Israel. The frustrations are also bubbling up within the White House and inside Biden's own campaign, as the president grapples with diplomatic relations in the wake of what some call the worst terrorist attacks in Israel since the Holocaust followed by airstrikes in Gaza that have taken a devastating humanitarian toll on Palestinians. After word came of Al-Fayoume's murder, Biden immediately released a statement, saying that this horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are. As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred, the president continued. I have said repeatedly that I will not be silent in the face of hate. We must be unequivocal. There is no place in America for hate against anyone. Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Chicago, told NBC News that in recent weeks, he is been inundated with complaints of hate crimes against members of the Muslim community, particularly women who are wearing the traditional hijab. There is also frustration over what they call a disparity in aid to the Middle East, with billions going to Israel compared to the 100 million going toward humanitarian efforts in Gaza. Biden had said if the terror group Hamas did not release the money to its people, he would cut off future funding. The White House sent an official, Dilawar Syed, to Al-Fayoume's funeral, but he was booed when he started to make remarks. Syed is the highest-ranking Muslim official in the Biden administration, serving as deputy administration of the Small Business Administration. He brought with him a letter of condolences from the president to the family, according to a White House official. Yosif said the boos came from Americans and everyone there -- not just by Muslims -- and were asked to leave if they did not stop. There have also been issues within Biden world with the appearance that the president has not done enough for Muslims. Staffers at both the White House and campaign have also received inquiries from communities of color, as well as Muslim groups, asking why the president has done more. Some of the internal discussions have included questions of why Biden has not visited a mosque. They have noted that then-President George W. Bush visited a mosque less than a week after the 911 terrorist attacks, according to a person familiar with the discussions.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"President Joe Biden made a point of singling out Wadea Al-Fayoume, the six-year-old Palestinian-American boy viciously stabbed to death in what authorities have charged as a hate crime.

Explain. Expose,"Former Clovis resident Jia Bei Zhu, a Chinese national, was arrested by federal agents on Thursday, October 19, 2023. (GV Wire CompositePaul Marshall) A top executive with a Reedley biolab was arrested Thursday in a sting operation at the very warehouse where city inspectors uncovered the company's illegal laboratory. Reedley City Manager Nicole Zieba introduced herself to Jia Bei Zhu, CEO of Universal Miedtech Inc., moments before agents with the Food  Drug Administration drew their weapons and arrested him. He pulled up, got out of his car, I shook his hand and said, 'Hello, David,' Zieba said. And the FDA law enforcement branch pulled up right behind to block him in, came of their cars with guns pointed at us. And you know, obviously, I backed away at that point and they took him into custody. Jia Bei Zhu, who also goes by the names Jesse Zhu, Qiang He, and David He, was arrested on a criminal complaint for manufacturing and distributing medical devices in violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. He also allegedly made false statements to the FDA, the YOU.S. Department of Justice said in a news release. Zhu, a Chinese national, is a former Clovis resident. As part of his scheme, the defendant changed his name, the names of his companies, and their location, YOU.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert said in a news release. The disarray at the Reedley lab led to the glare of publicity he was trying to avoid, and the ensuing investigation unraveled his efforts to circumvent the requirements that are designed to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. Zhu had broken off contact with investigators shortly before the media had found out about the 20 deadly diseases, 1,000 lab mice, and thousands of gallons of biological materials owned by UMI at 850 I St. in Reedley. When all of this kind of went public, we lost communication, Zieba said. We knew that the feds, the FDA, were working on charges. They were able to get a warrant. But even if you have a warrant, if you do not know where the person is, it is hard to arrest him. But it was a claim filed on behalf of UMI to collect damages from the company's destroyed assets that led to Zhu's capture. Related Story: Reedley Biolab Owners Want 50 Million to Cover Lost Mice, Antibodies FDA agents had tried to get Reedley officials to get Zhu to come to the city where they could arrest him in a controlled environment, said Jesalyn Harper, code enforcement officer with Reedley. Harper originally discovered a hose coming out of the warehouse. On further investigation, she and others found everything stored at the warehouse. Harper won Code Enforcement Officer of the Year because of the discovery. But federal agents did not know how to get Zhu to come to the city. On Friday, Fresno County officials received a claim for 50 million from an attorney representing UMI. The city of Reedley received a 30 million claim the following Monday. This gave federal agents the means to get Zhu. Harper said she and Zhu had become comfortable enough that they could speak on the phone. They coordinated that he would arrive at 11 a.m. Thursday at the warehouse to meet her and Zieba. We were preparing to orchestrate the situation when the claim was filed with the city of Reedley for the 30 million that opened the door for us to really establish communication with David and his attorneys again because we had not really heard from him since the situation at the lab went to press, Harper said Once Zhu got out of his car, agents were able to identify him and that is when they arrested him. If convicted, Zhu could face three years in prison for misbranding medical devices and five more years for making false statements. Federal attorneys could add more charges. Zieba cited an article claiming Zhu is wanted in Canada, fleeing that country in 2014. The DOJ did not have any information regarding about the situation in Canada. This is just the start of charges to hold him, Zieba said. Because obviously, this man is a flight risk. You know, this man has multiple identities, he is been in multiple countries. And these charges are charges where they can clearly hold him. So, I do expect that the community is going to see more charges coming. Federal law mandates that if convicted, criminals have to serve at least 80 of their sentence. Zhu is only one of the executives connected with UMI and Prestige Biotech. Xiaoxiao Wang also identified herself as the CEO of UMI. There are two women who have been involved that we have actually, you know, one of them we met on site, Zieba said. SO, I do not know... if they are involved in the criminal aspect of any of this. Between December 2020 and March 2023, Universal Meditech Inc and Prestige Biotech Inc connected, imported, sold, and distributed COVID-19 test kits and pregnancy test kits at their plant in south central Fresno and at Reedley, the DOJ says. But neither company had the required authorizations to manufacture test kits, investigators say. One of UMI's authorizations expired in 2020. The FDA issued a recall on UMI's COVID-19 test kits in February. When questioned by FDA officials, investigators say Zhu made false statements about his identity, his ownership, and control of the two companies, as well as their activities. Manufacturing COVID test kits requires an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. Because of major deficiencies in UMI's test studies, the company never received one, the DOJ said. During the investigation, Zhu told officials he was hired as a COVID-19 consultant in 2021. He also said Prestige Biotech had hired him to communicate with governmental agencies regarding the biological materials discovered at the Reedley lab. Investigators allege Zhu also represented himself as David He. Harper maintained communications with He throughout the investigation. Despite having a strong feeling that Zhu and He were the same person, Harper said she made sure not to clue him into that fact. Representative Jim Costa (D-Fresno) called Zhu's arrest a step in the right direction. The arrest of Jia Bei Zhu is a step in the right direction to hold him and those behind the illegal Reedley lab accountable, Costa said in a statement. I brought federal agencies in and pushed for investigations, which resulted in this arrest. I am hopeful that further investigations will fully unravel the details and purpose of the lab in Reedley. Fresno City Councilman Garry Bredefeld called for more transparency and accountability. The Department of Justice announcement that they arrested the operator of the illegal Reedley Chinese biolab is great news, Bredefeld said. There needs to be accountability for the activities that took place there and the danger it posed to the public. The public also needs to know what these people were doing with infectious agents that included COVID-19, rubella, malaria, Hepatitis B and C, and the experiments that were taking place. There is still much more to know about their intentions and the public had and has every right to know that information. Zieba said she was relieved an arrest was made. We have wanted this so badly, Zieba said. We have wanted accountability and consequences for what this company had done to our community.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Jia Bei Zhu, CEO of Universal Miedtech Inc., was arrested by federal agents on Thursday, October 19, 2023.

(Nasdaq: TSLA) is planning to open a service and collision center in Renton, according to public records. Pre-application documents were filed with the city of Renton last December for a 115,000-square-foot building at 600 SW 10th. The site, which is roughly 10 acres, was previously occupied by the metal fabrication company Ryerson. The lease was signed during the third quarter, according to a report by CBRE. An opening date has not been determined. The city of Renton welcomes Tesla and the electric vehicle industry, Gina Estep, economic development director for Renton, told the Business Journal on Thursday. In March 2023, a separate permit request was filed to create a 3.3-acre parking lot with 137 spaces. However, that work cannot begin until the stormwater permit is obtained from the Washington State Department of Ecology, according to city documents. The industrial warehouse building is about five minutes away from a 10,000-square-foot Tesla store, which is located at 700 S Grady Way. The building is owned by Elion Partners, which is known to lease space to the Austin, Texas-based electric vehicle manufacturer. Elion acquired the industrial building in January 2021 for 27.6 million from Ryerson. Elion, based in Miami, has leased similar buildings to Tesla, according to a report by the South Florida Business Journal. In August, it requested a zoning change in Miami Beach to allow for a Tesla showroom, service center and office space in a 78,000-square-foot warehouse. Tesla service centers are used to get vehicles ready for pickup by buyers and to receive vehicles returned from leases. The centers also perform maintenance such as tire replacement, software updates and parts replacement. Earlier this year, Telsa leased a 245,000-square-foot building in Marysville's Cascade Industrial Center, which will be used as a parts and assembly plant.

The circumstances of damage to the communications cables between Estonia-Finland and Estonia-Sweden are similar, the spokesperson told Reuters. Human action? The Swedish government has been informed by Estonia that the damage to the telecommunication cable linking the two countries had resulted from outside physical impact, daily Aftonbladet reported, citing Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson. A Swedish naval vessel, submarine rescue ship Belos, had been sent to the area and Jonson told the newspaper he expected the Swedish military to provide an initial preliminary analysis of the investigation at the site within 24 hours. We cannot rule out anything at this stage, Jonson was quoted as saying. The Swedish defence minister's and Estonian Prosecutor General's staff did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests to confirm the comments. The Prosecutor General spokesman said earlier on Thursday they have not yet determined whether the damage to this cable was caused by human actions. Checking vessels Separately, Finnish police said they had completed their crime scene investigation into the damage on the pipeline, without giving further details. On the same day Estonia said it surveyed the extent of the damage to the Estonia-Finland telecom cable, and will soon have more information about its nature and causes. We are working on different investigative versions and will continue to check all important circumstances, including data related to the vessels that were in the area at the time of the events, the Prosecutor General spokesman said. The most recently reported incident, on the Sweden-Estonia cable, occurred in the afternoon of October 7, an executive at Arelion, the owner and operator of the cable, told Reuters.

The move comes 10 days after Finland reported damage to a key pipeline running on the seafloor, and Sweden later reported a subsea telecom cable had also been damaged. These incidents came 13 months after the Nord Steam pipeline was also damaged in the Baltic. While it is widely believed the pipeline was sabotaged, investigators so far have failed to confirm the identity of the perpetrators. At the same time, the incidents highlighted the vulnerability of key assets and infrastructure. We continue to monitor the situation closely, and we remain in close contact with our Allies Estonia and Finland, and our partner Sweden, said acting NATO spokesperson Dylan White. NATO will continue to adapt its maritime posture in the Baltic Sea and will take all necessary steps to keep Allies safe. Since the Nord Stream sabotage in September 2022, NATO has enhanced patrols near critical undersea infrastructure and has promoted technological innovation - including with drones - to better detect any suspicious activity. In response to the latest incidents, NATO reports it is further increasing measures including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights. They are deploying maritime patrol aircraft, NATO AWACS planes, and drones. A fleet of four NATO minehunters is also being dispatched to the area. NATO AWACS are increasing patrols over the Baltic (NATO) Last week, NATO Defense Ministers and the Swedish Defense Minister endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision, a further long-term initiative to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness. According to NATO's spokesperson, the Digital Ocean initiative will transform Allied maritime domain awareness by enhancing coordination between national and Allied capabilities employed for maritime surveillance. This includes a broad range of assets from satellites to autonomous systems below, on, and above the sea. At the Vilnius Summit on October 12, NATO leaders agreed to establish NATO's Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command (MARCOM) in the United Kingdom, to increase our situational awareness and enhance deterrence and defense in the maritime domain. Earlier this year, NATO created a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector. The Digital Ocean Vision initiative will further enhance maritime situational awareness for the security of critical undersea infrastructure. As a next step, NATO Allies will develop a roadmap to guide the future development of maritime capabilities in line with other efforts across the Alliance, including NATO's Digital Transformation and the Defense Production Action Plan. The UK Prime Minister has long been critical of the efforts to protect subsea assets, including developing a detailed position paper on vulnerabilities. Last year, after becoming Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak accelerated plans to acquire and deploy two former commercial offshore vessels to increase the UK's surveillance efforts. The Royal Navy recently commissioned both of the vessels, one focusing on protecting subsea assets, while the other is being used as part of efforts to hunt out mines.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"NATO reports working with its Allies they plan to step up patrols in the Baltic Sea following the recent damage to undersea infrastructure in the region.

The highest weather alert, which has been in place since 6pm on Thursday and is expected to last until midday on Friday, has been extended to cover Angus, South Aberdeenshire, Perth and Kinross and Dundee. People in these areas are urged not to travel and to stay at home, with 'exceptional' levels of rain likely to result in significant disruption and danger to life. Meanwhile, amber warnings for wind and rain remain in place for many other parts of the country where residents have been urged to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. On the first day of the storm, thousands of homes in the coastal areas of eastern Scotland and across the north experienced power outages during the torrential conditions. Most affected households have already been reconnected and operational resource levels remain good. As the storm hits Scotland tonight and into tomorrow, people have been urged to plan ahead and expect significant disruption to transport. Road operating companies have been working to clear roads while rail and bus services have been axed in affected areas. SEPA has issued local flood warnings and encouraged people to follow alerts. In areas of Angus, evacuation plans are being drawn up in the event of extreme flood risks. A major incident has also been declared for Perth and Kinross, Dundee City and Angus local authority areas. Deputy First Minister Shona Robison said: Storm Babet is still in its early stages and the worst impacts are yet to come. Protecting the public is our immediate priority and we are coordinating a national effort to ensure that people are safe. The Red Warning has been expanded to cover further parts of Scotland and we expect weather conditions to deteriorate seriously overnight. Our message is clear - if you live in the areas covered by the Red Warning, please stay at home and do not travel, unless advised to relocate to a rest centre. With weather warnings in place for much of the country, I would urge everyone to be vigilant and to exercise extreme caution. No matter where you live, please make sure you stay up to date with conditions affecting your area. If you need to travel in a yellow warning area then make sure you can travel safely and that roads and services are not impacted. We are working with partners across the country, including emergency services, the voluntary sector and energy companies, to make sure that we mitigate disruption as much as possible. However, we are clear that there will be considerable disruption and we expect to launch a major clean-up operation as we move into the weekend. Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Houston said: Emergency services, local authorities and a range of resilience partnerships are working extremely hard to prepare and respond during what is an extremely challenging event. Police officers are helping local authorities evacuate a large number of properties in the Tayside area which is seeing some of the most significant impacts of the storm. I would urge people to continue to follow advice and listen to media broadcast, including radio, for updates. Follow your local authority for the latest updates in your area as well as police, the Met Office website and Traffic Scotland. I would encourage everyone to share this information with people who do not have access to the internet. Police travel advice is to avoid any form of travel in areas covered by the red weather warning. Driving conditions are extremely dangerous and floodwater could cause a danger to life. Plan ahead and do not travel into areas affected by the Red weather warning. Pascal Lardet, SEPA Flood Duty Manager, said: There is exceptional rainfall forecast for parts of Scotland over the next 24 hours, and this will lead to significant flooding from both surface water and rivers. Regional Flood Alerts were issued over the last two days to provide early awareness, and localised Flood Warnings started to be issued this morning. More will be issued across the day, so I do encourage people to check our Flood Updates for all the latest information. You can also follow SEPAFlood on X. However, it is important to stress that not all areas that could be affected have Flood Warning schemes, so please do take a Flood Alert in your area as advance notice that you could be affected. Follow the advice of the emergency services and take action now to protect yourself and your property. Hazards can be hidden, so please do not walk or drive into flood water. Remember that not only is flood water likely to be dirty, 30 cm of fast flowing water can move an average family sized car, and just 15 cm of fast flowing water could be enough to knock you off your feet.

Joseph Findley, 43, has been arrested by the FBI on federal terrorist charges following a string of alleged attacks against railroad carriers on October 6. He is accused of placing railroad spikes onto the path of oncoming trains and wedging pieces of metal into a rail switch. During a test run for a CSX employee appreciation day, one train hit an obstruction on the track and temporarily derailed before the wheels dropped back into place. On investigation, CSX train employees found metal materials jammed into the tracks and rail switches. The issue became more concerning once employees began to find purposely placed materials on the tracks for months. It is believed by officials that the way the materials have been placed matches methods taught by international terrorist groups to make homemade derail devices. Findley lives with his parents near the CSX tracks in Cleveland's St. Clair-Superior neighborhood. His mother, Mary Findley told FOX8 : 'He is never been a bad kid, never, he was always good. He is no terrorist; somebody is making that up.' When asked about her son's behavior on the tracks, she responded: 'He is been depressed because he lost his job, he lost his girlfriend, but he never did anything like that. 'They are nuts, he is not a terrorist. I think they all exaggerated it because he never did anything bad.' The FBI began their investigation in August and discovered that surveillance cameras at Dominion Energy were not positioned to show the nearby railroad tracks. Once the company agreed to change the direction of the cameras, multiple images of a bald man in shorts and a black shirt placing items on the tracks five times were caught between August and October 1. When police began to try to identify the photographed man, one employee at a nearby business recognized him as the accused. The FBI executed a search warrant on Findley's house and he was arrested on the same day. Apart from the CSX train's temporary derailment, no other train has suffered any severe damage. It is not yet known how far along Findley placed the jamming metal pieces on the tracks. A thorough search has not yet been ordered. He has been charged with terrorist attacks against railroad carriers. As per the channel, Findley is being held without bond in jail till his hearing in the YOU.S. District Court next week.

'Many (BNP and its allies) remained silence (against the Israeli attack on Palestine) fearing that they, who commit such incidents, may be upset on them. So, they have no courage to say something for the repressed people,' she said. The prime minister came up with the statements while inaugurating record 150 bridges in 39 districts of eight divisions in a single day at Sarak Bhaban of Tejgaon in Dhaka. She said that BNP and its allies did not say anything about the Palestine issue. 'But, they are doing movement calling for resignation (of the current government),' she said, dubbing BNP's stance 'most unfortunate'. At the function, the prime minister announced that Bangladesh would observe one day state mourning on Saturday commemorating deaths of Palestinians by Israeli attacks. On the day, the national flags will be hoisted at half mast, she said. She also asked to offer special prayers in all mosques across the country after Jumma prayers today and other worship places at their convenient times seeking eternal peace of the departed souls and quick recovery of the injured Palestinians in the Israeli attack. The prime minister said that they had already denounced the attacks on a Gaza hospital killing over 500 people including women and children and injuring a lot of people. 'The repeated (Israeli) attacks on them (Palestinians) cannot be tolerated anymore. We cannot tolerate it,' she said. Referring to her Wednesday's meeting with the OIC member countries envoys at her official Ganabhaban residence here, she said, 'We (Muslim Ummah) have to work together to realise the rights of Palestinians.' Sheikh Hasina reiterated Bangladesh steadfast stance in favour of Palestine, saying, 'We are always with them (Palestinians).' She said that Bangladesh would send medicines, dry foods and other necessary items for the people of war-torn Palestine. 'We will send medicines, dry food and necessary commodities for women and children. We have taken this step. We are always beside the distressed people with whatever resources we have,' she added. Sheikh Hasina said that she already asked the health ministry to take steps for sending medicines to the Palestinians. The prime minister also reiterated her call to the global leaders to stop the war and arms race. 'Use the money, which is being expended in producing arms and in destruction, for the health and education of the children, through which they will get fine and beautiful life,' she added. At the function, the prime minister, as well, unveiled a mural of Bangladesh's founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and planted a sapling on the Sarak Bhaban premises. Of the inaugurated bridges, 40 are in Mymensingh division, 32 in Dhaka, 27 in Chattogram, 22 in Rajshahi, 12 in Khulna, eight each in Barishal and Rangpur, and one in Sylhet. Earlier, on November 7 and December 21 last year, the prime minister opened 100 bridges and 100 roads and highways across the country. At the same function, she also opened 14 overpasses on highways that will help ensure road safety and laid foundation stone of two major bridges, Kewatkhali Bridge and Rahmatpur Bridge over the Brahmaputra River in Mymensingh. It will cost Tk 3263.63 crore to construct the Kewatkhali Bridge which is set to be the largest steel-arch bridge in the country while the construction of 1471-metre Rahmatpur Bridge will cost Tk 358 crore. The construction of the bridges will be completed by June 2025. Among 14 overpasses opened, eight are in Rajshahi division and six in Rangpur. The projects have been implemented under the Roads and Highways Department. The prime minister also launched the automated Vehicle Inspection Centre for five years at a cost of Tk 105.23 crore in the capital's Mirpur, a newly constructed building of Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority in Tejgaon, and BRTC's bus depot and training centre in Mymensingh. She, as well, introduced the compensation programme for road accident victims by providing Tk 7.08 crore as compensation to 162 road accident victims or their families. The prime minster also unveiled the cover of a book titled 'Unnayan Darpon' featuring the development of the road transport and bridges sector by the Awami League government in Bangladesh for the last 15 years. Earlier, on her arrival at the Sarak Bhaban, the prime minister was welcomed with dance performance by a group of children. Road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and road transport and bridges ministry's parliamentary standing committee chairman Rowshan Ara Mannan spoke at the function Road Transport and Highways Division secretary ABM Amin Ullah Nuri and its chief engineer Syed Moinul Hasan also spoke. Local public representatives, noted personalities and commoners got connected to the programme from Mirpur BRTA in Dhaka and Mymensingh circuit house field. A video documentary on the development projects to be inaugurated and laid foundation stones was screened at the programme. Sheikh Hasina, also president of the Awami League, asked the countrymen to remain alert about terrorism, arson attacks and destructive activities in the name of movement. She also asked all concerned to bring to book the culprits who will be found involved in such heinous attacks taking the advantage of the technology. 'Take legal actions against those who are out to set fire to make sure that no harm is caused to the people,' she said, reiterating that she has no problem with the peaceful movement of the BNP. Terming the BNP as a terrorist and killer party, the prime minister said that they did nothing for the welfare of Bangladesh and its people, rather transformed it into a country of militancy, terrorism and corruption. 'The BNP in the past had created Bangla Bhai, extremism and terrorism in the country. Make sure that such a situation never comes back again to the life of the countrymen,' she said. The BNP is now waging movement to topple the government on the plea of free and fare election under non-partisan government despite the fact that they have destroyed the system, she said. BNP wants to dislodge the government, but the people of the country are with the Awami League government, she said, adding the masses are the strength of her party. The prime minister said that the BNP-led 20-party alliance had secured only 30 seats in the 2008 national election. 'This is their (BNP and allies) strength and acceptability to the people and they are now talking about free and fair election,' she said. Those who came to power illegally violating the constitution after 1975 did not want Bangladesh to march towards prosperity independently. Briefly describing her government measures in building the road network across the country by constructing roads, highways, bridges and rail bridges, she said that they had a target to link Bangladesh with the Trans Asian Railway and Highway. 'This will help strengthen the regional connectivity between South and Southeastern Asia and boost trade, business and economic activities among the countries,' she said. The prime minister said that her government had so far constructed 1131 small and large bridges across the country. She continued that they had built the Padma Bridge, Bangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna River alongside constructing other major bridges such as Modhumoti Bridge, Payra Bridge, Ruspshi Bridge, Dhorala Bridge, Meghan Bridge, Shitalakhya Bridge 1 and 2, and Gabkhan Bridge. The prime minister said that they were not only developing the road network, but also developing the railways, waterways and airways. 'In this way, we are working to develop the country,' she said. The prime minister, however, asked all including passengers, drivers, owners, labourers and passersby to obey the traffic rules to make sure own and others' safety. 'The drivers would have to stop completion on the roads for sake of safety,' she said. She suggested for giving the physical and mental training to the drivers alongside giving the long route drivers time to take required rest while driving. The prime minister asked the drivers to obey the speed limit and traffic rules. 'Road accidents not only because sufferings to passengers, but also to the drivers,' she continued. Against the backdrop of the global economic recession and food crisis, the prime minister once again called upon all to bring every inch of fallow lands under cultivation to boost food production.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Sheikh Hasina came up with the statements while inaugurating record 150 bridges in 39 districts of eight divisions in a single day at Sarak Bhaban of Tejgaon in Dhaka.

The humanoid robot called Digit is under test in a warehouse in Texas, and has arms and legs and can grasp and handle packages like a human worker. Amazon now has 750,000 robots working in facilities around the world, but the move to humanoid robots is new - sparking fears for the future of human workers at the company. The company has denied that it intends to move to 'robot only' warehouses. The bipedal robot is currently being used to shift empty tote boxes in the warehouse: it is five foot nine inches tall, weighing 140lb - and can pick up and carry objects weighing up to 35lb. The move sparked fears about the future of Amazon's 1.5 million human workers. The Digit robot stands five foot nine inches tall (Amazon) Meet the robot that thinks 'replacing humanity will be fun' Advertisement Amazon Robotics Chief Technologist Tye Brady said that the testing of 'Digit', the bipedal robot from Agility, was in its 'very, very early stages'. Amazon Robotics Chief Technologist Tye Brady said, 'We are taking a lot of care to understand it better and see if there is a fit for our processes.' Digit from Agility Robotics can take on many human tasks 'that are too repetitive, physically demanding or dangerous for the humans it works with,' the company says. It is one of a wave of humanoid robots from firms ranging from start-ups to big tech players including Elon Musk's Tesla, which is creating a humanoid robot called Optimus. Musk has said that he believes the robots could one day be more important than the company's cars. Goldman Sachs predicted that the market for humanoid robots could be worth 150 billion a year worldwide within 15 years - and that humanoid robots will be viable in factories between 2025-2028 and in other jobs by 2030-2035. The Sequoia robot system can speed up deliveries by 25 the company says (Amazon) Elon Musk's Optimus robot can also take on any human task (Tesla) Amazon is investing heavily in robotics, having announced a 1 billion 'Industrial Innovation' fund last year. Other companies such as Sanctuary AI believe that robots will be capable of doing any human chore within 10 years - its Phoenix robot has already been demonstrated packing items in shops. Amazon has claimed that the bipedal robots will not 'take human jobs' arguing that the technology can help by 'freeing employees up to better deliver for our customers'. Amazon claims that its robotics systems have created 'hundred of thousands of new jobs' within its operations. Amazon said, 'This includes 700 categories of new job types, in skilled roles, which did not exist within the company beforehand,' the firm said. According to the tech giant, it now has more than 750,000 robots working 'collaboratively' with its human staff, often being used to take on 'highly repetitive tasks' Amazon has 750,000 robots working for it (Amazon) Amazon wrote in a blog post, 'We believe that there is a big opportunity to scale a mobile manipulator solution, such as Digit, which can work collaboratively with employees. 'Our initial use for this technology will be to help employees with tote recycling, a highly repetitive process of picking up and moving empty totes once inventory has been completely picked out of them.' At a separate media event Amazon Robotics chief technologist Tye Brady told reporters that he believed human workers were irreplaceable. He said that there was no possibility that Amazon could have fully automated warehouses in future. Brady said, 'There is not any part of me that thinks that would ever be a reality.' 'People are so central to the fulfillment process; the ability to think at a higher level, the ability to diagnose problems.' At the event, Brady announced the use of a new robotic system called Sequoia at one of its Houston warehouses - which can speed up fulfilment of orders by 25. Brady said, 'Collaborative robotics involves people. How can we have people be the stars, the spotlight, the centre of the show, when it comes to the jobs that we have to do?' 'When we do our job really, really well, our robotic systems just kind of blend into the background to become ubiquitous.

The last red alert in the UK was issued back in 2020, underscoring the seriousness of the current weather conditions. Officials have urgently advised Scots to stay away from coastal areas as the situation unfolds. Ireland, too, has felt the impact of this storm, known as Storm Babet according to UK officials. Several towns and villages have already been affected by flooding, with some areas still submerged and without electricity. In County Cork's town of Midleton, where over 100 properties were flooded, soldiers have been aiding with evacuation efforts. In Denmark, residents are working tirelessly to set up sandbags along vulnerable areas. The Danish Emergency Management Agency, located in Assens on the central island of Funen, is deploying substantial rubber tubes in the harbor to counter rising water levels, as reported by TV2. The Southern Denmark police are urging people along the east coast to evacuate if the weather predictions hold, as cottages, harbors, and other places could be submerged. The southwestern Danish town of Koege has made an urgent appeal on its Facebook page. Emergency workers are currently filling sandbags, and citizens are advised to minimize water-intensive activities. The municipality's treatment plant is at risk of being overwhelmed. The ripple effect of this storm extends to travel disruptions in the region. Copenhagen's airport and the Danish national rail company have warned travelers about cancellations and delays expected on Friday due to the inclement weather. Moreover, several ferry lines between Danish islands have been suspended, along with ferries to Rostock in northern Germany and Oslo. Swedish meteorologists have also issued a warning for the south coast, effective from Friday evening into Saturday. They anticipate that the water levels in southern Sweden may reach their highest point since the 1990s. In Germany, authorities are alerting residents to the possibility of high water in bays in Schleswig-Holstein, just south of the Danish border, until mid-Saturday. There are also warnings of elevated water levels on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state, with water levels potentially rising up to 2 meters (6.6 feet) above average in the inlet where the city of Flensburg is situated. This has led to delays and cancellations for some ferries to the North Sea islands of Foehr and Amrum, as reported by the German news agency dpa. Norwegian meteorologists are attributing these weather conditions to a strong low-pressure area over Great Britain, coupled with high pressure over northern Scandinavia, which is resulting in powerful east-northeasterly winds. Very strong gusts are expected to impact southern Norway from the east, making it crucial for residents in the affected regions to remain vigilant as the storm progresses.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Danish Meteorological Institute predicts worst flooding in over a century.

The coach has rotating seats and glass roof and windows that offer a 360-degree view. Speaking on the occasion, the railway minister said, In the last nine years, Northeastern states and Jammu Kashmir have changed a lot and the change is discernible on the ground. The prime minister (Narendra Modi) has visited the Northeast region more than 60 times which is higher than the visits of prime ministers before him, Vaishnaw said. He added that after the abrogation of Article 370, the development of Jammu and Kashmir is moving at a fast pace. Recently, meetings of the G20 were held in Jammu and Kashmir. Various railway projects are underway in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast, the minister said. The railways has allotted an annual budget of around Rs 10,269 crore for the Northeast, while earlier it was around Rs 2,122 crore, he said. Railway projects are progressing swiftly in Northeastern states. Two Vande Bharat trains are also planned for the Northeast. In Jammu and Kashmir, work has been completed on the Chenab Bridge, Anji Bridge, and tunnels have been completed except in some portions. The railways is working for the overall transformation of Northeastern states, Vaishnaw said. Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Sinha said that the Vistadome coach of the Banihal-Budgam train will attract tourists in large numbers.

Please try again later verifyErrors  A 57-year-old woman has died after being swept away in a river as a fierce storm batters parts of Scotland, bringing unprecedented downpours and forcing a whole town to evacuate during a rare red weather alert. Thousands of homes were left without power or facing their properties being flooded during Storm Babet on Thursday night, as the Scottish government warned residents in affected areas that the worst was yet to come. The storm, the second named one of the season, prompted a rare Met Office red danger to life warning, which took effect at 6pm on Thursday. It was feared that the storm would cause near-record rainfall before spreading into northern and eastern England. Forecasters warned some communities could be cut off for several days by severe flooding, while the British Geological Survey warned the storm could also because landslides. Some of those worst affected were residents of Angus, north of Dundee. The council said the residents of 335 homes in Brechin and 87 homes in Tannadice and Finavon were asked to leave because of the risk of severe flooding and schools were forced to close. People were urged to take their own sleeping bags, pillows and blankets to the three rest centres set up in the area. But one resident said he would stay put, while others were pictured building their own flood defences with sandbags. John Stewart, 82, of Brechin, said he would not leave his home should authorities try to get him to go. Meanwhile, police in Angus said a 57-year-old woman's body was recovered on Thursday afternoon at Water of Lee, Glen Esk, two hours after officers received a report of a person having been swept into the water. Douglas Ross, MP for Moray and MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said his thoughts and deepest sympathies went out to the family and friends of the lady who has sadly lost her life. Storm Babet - follow our live coverage here Flood barriers have been put in place in towns in the east of Scotland while around 20,000 homes lost power. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it restored services to 14,000 homes, while engineers were working to reconnect the rest. ScotRail imposed mass train cancellations, expected to last from Thursday until Saturday. Services on both the East Coast and West Coast main rail lines were in disarray because of blockages on the lines. In Aberdeenshire, the council warned residents to be ready to leave imminently and more than doubled the number of rest centres to five, from two earlier in the day. Council officials also postponed funerals until next week, while leisure centres, recycling centres, and vaccination centres all closed early because of the red weather warning, and will be shut on Friday. Massive waves were pictured crashing over a sea wall at Stonehaven Harbour in Aberdeenshire, with David Jacobs, 56, saying he saw waves around 20ft high on the coast of the town. He said The wind is swinging east tomorrow so it will be coming directly into the harbour. The last time I have seen weather like this was 2014. It is quite spectacular to watch but bits of trees and rocks land onto the road. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had warned of unprecedented rainfall, with flooding that would cause significant disruption. Yellow severe weather warnings - the second most serious, indicating strong winds and potential flooding - are in effect until Saturday for a swathe of the UK, covering already-saturated parts of Scotland and northern and eastern England, even as far south as Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Scotland's deputy first minister Shona Robison said on Thursday evening that the worst effects of the storm were yet to come. We are only at the start of this weather event - that is really important for people to appreciate, she said. The red warning has been expanded to cover further parts of Scotland and we expect weather conditions to deteriorate seriously overnight. If you live in the areas covered by the red warning, please stay at home and do not travel, unless advised to relocate to a rest centre. We expect to launch a major clean-up operation as we move into the weekend. Sepa issued 18 additional flood warnings as well as a severe warning for Angus. Aberdeenshire Council issued instructions to residents who may have to evacuate. It said: If the police, council or other emergency services ask you to leave your home for your own safety and that of others, turn off the electricity and water supply at the main switch (be sure you know where these are located) and take your grab bag with you. If you have to evacuate your home, it will make things a lot easier if you have prepared a 'grab bag' in advance containing a packing list to follow should you need to use it.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A 57-year-old woman has died after being swept away in a river as a fierce storm batters parts of Scotland.

Still, mom Beth Holloway said she is at peace knowing her never ending nightmare has come to an end. Her daughter's killer has finally been named in an imperfect plea deal that probably marks the best chance at justice the Holloway family will ever receive. Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to extortion and wire fraud in an agreement that compelled him to reveal all he knows about Natalee Holloway's killing in Aruba -- a crime he admitted to committing. Van der Sloot is already serving time in Peru for another murder and the 20-year sentence handed to him on Wednesday will run concurrently. The confessed killer is free to reveal almost anything about the slaying as the statute of limitations for murder in Aruba, 12 years, has long since past. So while this deal did not win Holloway's family any satisfaction of seeing van der Sloot locked up for Natalee's murder, the victim's mother said it did provide a commodity almost as valuable -- answers. I do not think any victim's family is going to think ever an amount of time is enough, Holloway told NBC News on Wednesday, hours after van der Sloot pleaded guilty to extortion and wire fraud. So here is what I have to take comfort in ... I needed the answers as to what happened to Natalee. Although a statute of limitations for murder might come as a shock to many Americans, it was front of mind for then-YOU.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, who brought this extortion case against van der Sloot in 2010. Laws in other countries can be very different than ours, particularly when it comes to statutes of limitation and the length of sentences, said Vance, now a legal analyst for NBC News. We were always cognizant of that in this case. As soon as Natalee Holloway went missing in the early morning hours of May 30, 2005 during a vacation to Aruba, Beth Holloway chartered down to the Caribbean island and came upon van der Sloot the next day, not knowing he would admit to the slaying 18 years later. I was face-to-face with my daughter's killer that night at the Holiday Inn. But I did not know it, Holloway said. I did not know that I was face-to-face with her killer. I thought it was face-to-face with a suspect that was involved in her disappearance. Five years after Natalee Holloway went missing, van der Sloot targeted Beth Holloway with a cruel scam, asking for 250,000 in exchange for information about her daughter's remains. Holloway's attorney, John Q. Kelly, even traveled to Aruba in May of 2010 to secure the deal. Van der Sloot received a 25,100 downpayment from the grieving mother -- for completely bogus information about Natalee Holloway's whereabouts. While van der Sloot initially got away with that hoax, it opened him up to a 2010 indictment for extortion and wire fraud in the United States. So when he landed in prison for the the murder of 21-year-old Peruvian college student Stephany Flores, that led to his extradition from Peru earlier this year and the eventual confession to Natalee Holloway's killing. Beth Holloway thanked a Washington, D.C., public relations firm, Patriot Strategies, for helping spur communications between the YOU.S. and Peru, resulting in van der Sloot's extradition. Washington and Lima have an extradition treaty, signed in 2001. Holloway said she and her friend, TV news personality Greta Van Susteren, carried this ball and we could push it down the field, but we just could not get it over, just could not get it over the end zone or over the line. Holloway also said she is grateful for federal prosecutors and investigators in Birmingham for allowing her to witness van der Sloot's confession from an adjacent room, rather than handing her transcripts after the fact. She heard van der Sloot's incriminating words live as it was happening in another room. They did an amazing job of letting me understand what was happening in real time, versus relaying it second-hand, the grieving mother said. Van der Sloot gave graphic details on how he kicked Natalee Holloway in the head after she spurned his sexual advances, then attacked the unconscious woman with a cinderblock. After dumping Holloway's lifeless body into the Caribbean Sea, he went home where he checked soccer scores and viewed pornography, according to the victim's mother. That is a person with no conscience, no remorse, no guilt, Holloway said. So that there were those little things, those are the elements when I go back to and think of 18 (van der Sloot's age in 2005) when he said now, yeah, that is him. And that is, that is just his mode of existence. Beth Holloway said she feels more at ease now following van der Sloot's admission, and looks forward to time with her adult son and grandchildren. Tomorrow's a new day, but today, today was a victory, she said.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Joran van der Sloot pleads guilty to extortion and wire fraud in Natalee Holloway case.

A series of treaties, known as the Geneva Conventions, were adopted in 1864, 1906, 1929 and 1949 to limit the barbarity of war, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Additional Protocols of 1977, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, as well as conventional weapons conventions, are also part of International Humanitarian Law, also known as IHL. The overriding goal of IHL is to protect civilians by restricting the actions of military forces. They are designed to protect people who do not take part in the fighting, such as civilians, medics and aid workers, as well as those who can no longer fight, such as wounded and sick combatants, and prisoners of war. In the wake of World War II and the Holocaust, all 196 members of the newly created United Nations adopted the four original Geneva Conventions, making them one of the world's most widely agreed upon international agreements. There are five basic principles under International Humanitarian Law: military actions must be necessary; they must distinguish between civilians and legitimate military targets; they must be proportionate, meaning they must avoid to the extent possible incidental harm; they must avoid unnecessary suffering, sometimes referred to as humanity; and, finally, the actions taken by the military must be honorable. The International Committee of the Red Cross, a global nonprofit based in Switzerland, is an independent, neutral organization that works to ensure humanitarian protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence. Known as the ICRC, its mandate and mission is to take action in response to emergencies and promote respect for international humanitarian law and its implementation in national law. The ICRC can investigate allegations of war crimes, but on its own has no power to prosecute them. Humanitarian law does not regulate when and if wars are justified or when they can start or end, said Ilia Utmelidze, director of the Case Matrix Network, a nonprofit group that investigates war crimes. It is a minimum standard of protection when wars are fought. All signatories to the Geneva Convention are obligated to investigate and prosecute war crimes domestically if they are aware of them. But the decisions are often wrapped in politics. Bottom line, we have the jurisprudence, the experience and the rules of procedure and evidence to prosecute those who commit war crimes, said David Crane, an American international law expert and the founding chief prosecutor of the United Nations' Special Court for Sierra Leone. But the bright red thread about whether a international tribunal is convened is political, not legal. Crane pointed out that, nevertheless, international tribunals have been convened to prosecute war crimes in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia, where war crimes occurred. In 1989, an effort was launched to create an International Criminal Court that would prosecute war crimes globally. The citizens or soldiers of any nation that signed a treaty known as the Rome Statute could be investigated and tried by the court for committing war crimes if such crimes are committed on the territory of this country. All told, 123 nations have signed the Rome Statute, including the State of Palestine, the YOU.K., France, Germany and Japan. Dozens of nations, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, have declined to ratify the Rome accord. They cite fears of bias by the court and argue that their own national military justice and legal systems are already adequately prosecuting war crimes. For some time now, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry has been collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, according to The Associated Press. That evidence could be added to an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court into possible war crimes by Israel and Hamas in past conflicts. Experts on the laws of war say that attacks on military posts are generally not war crimes. While the decision by Hamas to attack Israel can be condemned and criticized as wrong, it does not in itself violate the rules of war. As a military, you get a license to kill, said Utmelidze, from Case Matrix Network, but you have to be prepared to pay with military lives of your own. It is indisputable that Hamas committed war crimes in their brutal attack on Israeli citizens, according to David Scheffer, one of the foremost experts on the laws of war. Scheffer, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first ever YOU.S. ambassador at large for war crimes issues during the Clinton administration. Scheffer noted that since Gaza and the West Bank are signatories to the ICC, it is possible that both Hamas and the individuals accused of committing crimes against humanity could face prosecution at The Hague. Intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects without a military necessary reason to do so is a war crime, period, said Crane, the international law expert. And that is a standard that both sides are held to under international law. Experts told NBC News that one of the central determinants in assessing whether war crimes have been committed is if the actions were intentional and without military purpose. Furthermore, they say, the mutilation of bodies, torture and hostage-taking are all considered war crimes. Crane said that, while blockades are legal, the nation imposing the blockade must take into consideration the effect on the civilian population. There is no bright line, he said, but we will know when it has gone too far. Scheffer said, It is an acceptable short-term tactic, but clearly it cannot be of a long duration. On Monday, the World Health Organization warned there were only 24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left in the Gaza Strip before a real catastrophe occurred. On Wednesday, Imene Trabelsi, a spokesperson for the ICRC, told NBC News that the water situation in Gaza is near catastrophic. The Israeli military is allowed to eliminate the Hamas threat, said Scheffer, but must do so in ways that protect Palestinian civilian lives and ultimately gives them the right to return to their homes. As Israel seeks out military targets and strikes them from the air, or engages them from the ground, it will always have to balance the safety and well-being of the civilian population with the military objective of eliminating Hamas, Scheffer said. It is a calculation that must be made in wartime. Crane said that Israel is in an impossible situation. It appears Israel is trying to follow the Geneva Convention and the law of armed conflict but, because the battlefield is one of the most densely populated areas on earth, and because Hamas has a history of hiding behind civilians, protecting the Palestinian people will be complex and civilian lives will be lost. Scheffer said Israel needs to tread carefully taking into account the guardrails that exist to protect civilians in Gaza. The laws of war can be complex, Scheffer conceded, but certain principles are crystal clear, for example, atrocities committed by Hamas do not permit Israel to commit atrocities in return. On Tuesday, a massive explosion destroyed Al-Ahli Hospital in central Gaza. Palestinian Health Ministry officials said it killed hundreds of civilians. Targeting hospitals is specifically outlawed under the first Geneva Convention. But even the protection of hospitals is not absolute. If hospitals are used to commit ... acts harmful to the enemy, then attacks on them may be permitted so long as they follow the rules of proportionality and precaution. The Israeli Defense Forces say it does not target hospitals and have offered evidence that the tragedy was the result of a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. YOU.S. intelligence officials have also assessed that Israel did not because the blast. Since October 7, the World Health Organization has reported 41 attacks on health care facilities and 74 attacks on ambulances or other medical transport vehicles in Gaza. On Tuesday, a YOU.N.-run school in northern Gaza was hit and six people were reportedly killed. Like hospitals, schools are civilian facilities and cannot be attacked, unless enemy combatants use the school as a base for attack. But even then, the attack must be proportionate. In other words, according to the IHL, if only a few combatants are inside, a small special forces team might be used for an attack, but demolishing the school with a large bomb would be disproportionate. Israel knows it will be under close scrutiny, said Scheffer. Israel must be able to defend itself without abandoning its own principles. If it fails to do so, it may find itself in a militarily superior position but ostracized on a risky perch.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Geneva Conventions were adopted in 1864, 1906, 1929 and 1949 to limit the barbarity of war.

And Cora Texas is only one of 11 sugar mills in Louisiana. It is a humongous operation. During harvest, the mill employees 220 people, including mechanics and machinists. Bearings have to be greased, bolt caps need to be tightened, machinery could give out. It is a lot of maintenance, says Schudmak. Between our employees, the trucks, the farmers, there could be 1,000 people waiting if something breaks down. Last year, the state produced more than 2 million tons of raw sugar, the most in the country, according to the American Sugar Cane League. It is a number that is hard to comprehend, even watching an excavator move huge scoops of sugar into an growing mountain. But let us back up: How does sugar cane go from what you see in the field to what you buy on the shelves? Here is the 10-step process. Step 1: Harvest Sugar cane is planted from late July to early September and harvested the following fall, typically starting at the end of September or early October. It is all determined by how many tons the mills need to process. That determines the time, says Patrick Frishhertz, who married into the eighth generation of farmers at St. Louis Planting Co. The cane might not be mature enough, but we have no choice. Our biggest risk is freeze. Last December, an arctic blast sent temperatures below freezing for three days in Louisiana, hurting the last of the sugar cane crop, but it was still a near-record year. This year, drought plagued Louisiana all summer and farmers and mills expect a lower yield. Older sugar cane generally matures faster, so it is harvested first. Farmers use combines to cut the cane, scoop it up, chop it into sections called billets, and toss them into a trailer following alongside From there, it is go time. Sugar cane deteriorates quickly and will go sour if not processed within 24 hours. It is the most processed crop to make a commodity, says Schudmak. Step 2: Transport Sugar cane is moved onto trucks at the farm and transported to the mill. Cora Texas has 150 trucks on the road 247 during harvesting season. We rent so many trucks Penske has a mechanic here full-time, says Schudmaker. A control screen at the mill uses GPS to see where the trucks are at any given moment. They are all tagged with information from the farms, so when they pull up to be weighed and tested the mill can track which farm is owed what. Step 3: Testing for sugar content A sample is taken from each truck into a lab, where employees simulate the process of the mill to determine the sugar content. They extract sugar and use ovens to mimic the mill's drying process. They are looking for the sugar content, because farmers are paid by sugar content per ton. Cora Texas buys about 1 million worth of sugar cane per day during harvest season. Step 4: Unload and Cut Trucks unload cane billets directly into a carrier at Cora Texas. The trailer is disconnected from the truck and tipped into the carrier using clamps. Everything is automatic and controlled by weight. Cora Texas can move one truck a minute through the line this way. The entire mill is very high-tech. After it is dumped, the sugar cane runs through three sets of knives. About 800 tons of sugar cane per hour can run through the cutting process. Step 4: Press for juice Once the cane is cut, it goes through huge rollers in the mill to produce juice. That is 800 tons of force pushing down on the cane, says Schudmaker. After cement, pressing sugar cane requires more torque than any other industry. The rollers at Cora Texas run at 10 million inch-pounds of torque with 3,000-horsepower turbines. About half a billion dollars of equipment hums inside the Cora Texas plant. Inside, the mill is steamy and sweet smelling. It smells like money, says Schudmaker with a laugh. Cora Texas presses 3,500 gallons of sugar cane juice per minute. The pressed juice flows through multiple mills, where it is separated from bagasse, sugar cane's pulpy waste. The bagasse from the last mill then goes into the boiler, where it is used as fuel to power the factory. Step 5: Clarification Sugar cane comes from fields, so naturally it is covered in dirt. The juice goes through a pumping process to remove any mud. From here, the it is boiled and treated with lime and other chemicals to remove impurities. Those make a spiderweb, which goes down and gets the dirt out, Schudmaker says. Step 6: Make sugar cane syrup Next, the sugar cane juice is concentrated into sugar syrup, which flows in a fluffy river into tanks. More foam means a higher sugar content. sugar cane has more water than sugar, so during this process water is removed. Cora Texas discharges 20,000 gallons of water per minute into the Mississippi River. Step 7: Make sugar! The sugar syrup is concentrated through evaporation. Then, tiny seed sugar crystals are added, which help large crystals form. We get a pallet of refined sugar and grind it. One pallet of refined sugar gives us enough crystals to make 500 million pounds of sugar, says Schudmaker. We start with a real small particle and grow it. Sugar keeps making the molecule bigger, and eventually makes a cube. Step 8: Crystallization At this point, the product is starting to look like sugar, but it is sticky and full of molasses. It goes through a centrifuge to dry it out and extract the molasses from the sugar. Sugar stays inside the centrifuge basket, while molasses flows out. All of Cora Texas's molasses -- about 10 million gallons -- is shipped to Quality Liquid Feeds, in Wisconsin, to be used for cattle feed. Step 9: Storage Finally, sugar is transported via belt into a warehouse -- 5 million pounds of it per day -- where it will stay until it is shipped to refineries throughout the year. Step 10: Refine The sugar made at Cora Texas and other Louisiana mills is raw, meaning it still has a film of molasses leftover from the last step. Refineries will further treat the sugar to remove the molasses and any impurities, resulting in the white table sugar you see on shelves. It takes so much time to make, but then sugar is so cheap you get it free with your coffee, Schudmaker says. The math behind the machines Sugar was not always this plentiful. Fifty years ago, we made only a couple thousand pounds of sugar, says Schudmaker. Sugar was mostly sold as syrup. During World War II, sugar was the first food to go on ration in the YOU.S., and the last to come off. In the 1980s, the YOU.S. had about 704,000 acres of sugar cane. That increased to 903,400 acres in 2020-2021. In that same period, sugar production grew from 2.9 to 4.25 million short tons raw value, according to the YOU.S. Department of Agriculture. For consumers, that means sugar is cheap -- typically around 25-cents per pound, though Schudmak and the Food and Agriculture Organization warned that could rise in the 2023-2024 year due to the El Nio phenomenon on sugar cane crops around the world, including drought in Louisiana. Still, the YOU.S. is producing tons, literally, of sugar, thanks to research into the most productive sugar cane varieties and increased mechanization of mills like Cora Texas. As far as technology, Louisiana is at the cutting edge, said Frishhertz.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Cora Texas Manufacturing Company in White Castle, Louisiana, is one of 11 sugar mills in the state.

We are hopeful that if the community really utilizes this service, JetBlue would consider expanding it, said Harrington, noting that some level of service is expected to begin in November before the daily service begins. JetBlue suspended the nonstop route between West Palm Beach and LAX in April 2022 after nearly 18 months of service four times a week. JetBlue officials attributed the cutback to the high price of fuel at that time.

Flights with one stop are currently available at PBIA, but they can take more than 10 hours, making them impracticable for many travelers. Air traffic throughout the country has surged since the lows in 2020 when COVID-19 affected air travel. PBIA is experiencing record passenger volume, according to Laura Beebe, director of airports. In July, 539,873 passengers flew out of the airport, a 17 increase over the same month in 2022. The year-to-date figure was 7.4 million, an increase of 15. Jeremy Smith, a professor of transportation and logistics at Keiser University, said it is clear that fear of catching COVID on airplanes has eased, resulting in a significant increase in travelers vacationing throughout the country but particularly in South Florida. Consumers had been very afraid to fly, he noted. That is no longer the case. IN FORT LAUDERDALE: New low-cost nonstop flights coming to FLL: Canadians, UF students to benefit More than 1 million passengers used JetBlue from January through July, accounting for 28 of PBIA's volume, making it the No. 1 carrier. In addition to the new JetBlue service, other seasonal flights returning to the airport include service to Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston and Washington-Dulles International Airport. PBIA reported that J.D. Power has ranked it as the nation's fourth-best medium-sized airport. We are honored and thrilled to be recognized by J.D. Power, Beebe said.

This comes just weeks after some passenger screening times approached two hours at New Zealand's busiest international arrivals hall, on September 17. Arriving at the New Zealand border, there are many checks and factors that can stack up to a substantial waiting time. With customs and biosecurity screening requirements to clear -- on top of waiting for checked luggage to be processed and delivered to the arrivals hall -- the airport is trialling ways to ease congestion at Auckland's many layers of border screening. Now it is hoped a biosecurity Express Lane path might allow some travellers with nothing to declare to cruise through required checks and, hopefully, speed up the process for all arrivals. Since September 22, 6286 passengers have been processed under the trial. Northern regional commissioner for the Ministry for Primary Industries, Mike Inglis, said the trial was already having an effect on wait times during the busy school holiday period. Open to New Zealand passengers identified as low risk in terms of biosecurity, Inglis says it is among measures that have already contributed to lowering processing times. Nearly 40 per cent of arrivals to Auckland are now eligible to pass through the Express Lanes. Biosecurity processing has been working well at international airports for arriving passengers over the holidays. The average biosecurity processing time, from entering the biosecurity lane to exiting risk assessment, has been close to nine minutes during the holiday period, says Inglis. This is down from an average of 13 minutes and 16 seconds in February. Some international arrivals, invited to take part in the trial, without checked luggage told the Herald they were able to pass through the terminal from plane to arrivals hall in 10 minutes, saying it was a great improvement on last month. Inglis says the Express Lane is still subject to checks by detector dogs, which have found undeclared fruit and sandwiches among the trial arrivals. We remind travellers that they should do the right thing and declare any risk items to avoid fines and delays, he says. However, while biosecurity screening has been streamlined by the new Express Lane queue, Customs wait times have slowly been creeping up. In some cases passengers are already unacceptably delayed before they even reach biosecurity screening. New Zealand Customs service standards aim for a maximum of 45 minutes for processing passengers from landing through to passport controls. However, there have been points in the past year where multiple arrivals, passenger declarations and bottlenecks of services have led to processing exceeding this. At three points in the past fortnight, arrivals met or or exceeded the maximum wait time before they had even cleared passport control. Disruption during the week of September 11 meant average wait times approached 44.3 minutes for 90 per cent of passengers. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) gives 45 minutes as the maximum wait for normal customs inspection. The optimal, expected processing time is just 20 minutes. A spokesperson for Auckland Airport says the New Zealand arrivals process is a complex one with many moving parts. The arrivals process is made up of a chain of organisations operating together in a system -- airlines, ground handlers, Customs, Biosecurity New Zealand and Auckland Airport, they said. Overall the new trials to streamline screening, including the biosecurity Express Lane, had led to faster processing during school holidays. The median time for the arrivals process for the first week of the school holiday was 10 per cent faster than for the previous six months. Everyone has been collectively pulling out all the stops to ensure travellers have a smooth experience over the busy school holiday period, saying that the Biosecurity Express Lane had shown early signs of success. It is hoped the trial might be in place for a busy expected summer travel period ahead and be rolled out to other international airport arrivals.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article,"Just over 6000 passengers at Auckland's international arrivals have been invited to trial a new Express Lane, aimed at cutting down unacceptable wait times at the border.

We are always evaluating our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our customers. After careful consideration, we have decided to close our Amazon Air operation at LeipzigHalle Airport and affected employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other facilities, an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) spokesperson said in an emailed statement, confirming news first reported by industry website ch-aviation. The hub was handling several flights per week operated by contractor ASL Airlines Ireland using Boeing 737-800 converted freighters, according to Amazon officials and aviation databases. ASL Airlines Ireland operates nine 737-800s in Europe under the Amazon livery. Amazon will continue to use LeipzigHalle as a delivery station for customers in the Saxony region, but the airport will not be used as a collection point for connecting other cities in Europe, the company said. Amazon began operating to LeipzigHalle airport, where it leased a 20,000-square-foot facility, in November 2020 with two freighters to speed package delivery for Prime members around the continent. The company said service will not be impacted by the hub's closure. The online retail giant has invested in expanding its European logistics network in recent years, including a fulfillment center outside Bremen, Germany, that opened in August. It plans to open an additional fulfillment center and a sortation center in Germany over the next three years. Amazon Air has also made changes to routes and flight frequencies in Europe to reduce overhead in line with a slowdown in e-commerce sales. ASL Aviation Holdings released 28 pilots in July after Amazon reduced flight requirements in Europe. The Chaddick Institute at DePaul University researches Amazon Air and estimated in March that ASL Airlines Ireland operates 22 flights per day on its behalf, not including auxiliary flights in nonbranded planes. Amazon, which relies entirely on partner airlines, is not alone in dialing back flight activity amid a lengthy freight transport recession. DHL Express, FedEx and UPS have all trimmed the number of flights on certain routes and outsourced airlift. The YOU.S. logistics integrators have also parked dozens of aircraft and accelerated the retirement of older aircraft types, with FedEx also closing some pilot and maintenance bases. The adjustments within Amazon's air logistics network are modest compared to FedEx and UPS. Growth in Amazon Air activity has slowed considerably this year after the e-commerce surge during the pandemic. That contrasts with FedEx and UPS, which have cut flight hours. In August, Amazon's domestic YOU.S. fleet took to the skies 3 more than the prior year following a 16 year-over-year gain in July. FedEx domestic flight activity was 7 lower in August than the prior year and 14 lower in July. UPS flight activity in the YOU.S. was 13.5 below 2022 levels for July and August.

The announcement read: Nearly 4 billion to improve connectivity, which could pay for schemes such as the extension of the Manchester Metrolink to Heywood, Bolton, Wigan and Manchester Airport and bus rapid transit corridors in Manchester. The north was also promised over 3bn in 'long term road resurfacing' to fix potholes and more than 500 million towards two major road schemes around Manchester, including a new link road between the M62 and the M60. In the announcement, a prospective map of the 'Network North' plans were shared, also appearing to show Manchester in the wrong place.

A high-level meeting to take stock of safety measures at the airport was held on Wednesday. According to airport officials, the project, funded under the central government's Udan scheme, is estimated to be at Rs 65 crore. The review meeting focused on the security arrangements for the impending airport, said officials. Airport officials said that the review meeting led by Deputy General Security Manager Vijayakumar and officials from the Vellore District Police undertook the inspection which covered various critical areas including the terminal, passenger arrival and departure zones, runway, lanes, and security gates. Given the importance of state police in providing security for such small airports, authorities engaged in a joint consultation to determine the required personnel for safeguarding the airport premises, said officials. Earlier this week, the airport officials had informed that the preliminary signal testing for take-off and landing has been successfully completed at Vellore Airport and steps are being taken to start flight services soon. In this regard, a preliminary test was done on Sunday to see if the lights specially set up near the runway are visible during the day and if the signal is received from the information control room and the signal tower, the officials added. The officials further said that the first phase of the test flight conducted at the Abdullapuram airport with respect to signal and lights has been successfully completed. The next step is to land the aircraft on the runway and test it. We have applied for permission to operate the aircraft, they added. They said that the permission will be granted soon and the flight services from here will start soon. The officials further said that a test aircraft belonging to the Air Transport Commission was flown from New Delhi to Vellore via Chennai as part of the preliminary testing. The aircraft was tested by low-flying five times near the Abdullapuram airstrip. It was inspected by three persons, including a pilot from the Aircraft Inspection Unit in New Delhi, the officials said. An ambulance and a fire engine were also kept ready near the airport runway as a precautionary safety measure.

According to airline officials, located in proximity of Terminal 3, at the Cargo complex of Delhi Airport's Air Cargo Logistics division, the centralised warehouse sprawling 54,000 sq. ft. (approx.), will improve quick turnaround of the airline's flights operating out of Delhi. The warehouse is a major milestone for Air India and a reinforcement of the quality, professionalism, and investment that we are now committed to make. This world class facility will not only boost Air India's fleet and operational efficiency but will also strengthen India's aviation ecosystem, said Campbell Wilson, CEO and MD, Air India. The warehouse will offer us more proximate access to and better control over our aircraft spares enabling us to meet any engineering requirement promptly - leading to improved punctuality of flights, said Wilson. The warehouse will fulfill engineering resource requirements for maintenance and service of the Air India, Air India Express and AIX Connect fleet from a centralised location by integrating 16 subscale and scattered locations spread across Delhi and Mumbai into a consolidated state-of-the-art facility that will function as a hub and feeder network for operations throughout India, said the official.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Air India has commissioned a warehouse facility at Delhi to facilitate storage of over 1,000,000 engineering spares.

A ski boot warmer stored in luggage sparked a bomb scare at Queenstown Airport that prompted an evacuation and emergency response on Friday morning. Airport chief executive Glen Sowry said the electrical device was spotted during screening of checked luggage about 8.40am. It sat under other dense material inside a bag alongside a computer and had wires hanging from it. Aviation Security staff had a close inspection and determined that it was a serious concern, he said. Police examined the image and contacted the New Zealand Defence Force, which also believed the object was suspicious and flew its Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit to the airport by helicopter from Christchurch. The unit deemed the reported items posed no threat, and the airport reopened at 3pm. Throughout the day, about 25 flights were disrupted or cancelled. Sowry said airlines were scheduling extra domestic and international flights over the weekend to get people to their destinations. I think it will take most of the weekend to be able to work through this, he said. About 250 passengers were taken by bus to the Queenstown Events Centre, near the airport, and were provided with food, drinks and activities until the airport reopened. Queenstown Airport thanked members of the public for their patience and understanding. The police cordon had been lifted and passengers were free to collect luggage and vehicles, while those with a confirmed flight reservation were also requested to come to the airport. If you have been impacted and do not have a confirmed booking, please contact your airline, was the authorities advice. The airport had been evacuated, and its emergency security protocols activated, with passengers taken by bus to a secure location earlier on Friday. At 11am, Queenstown Airport said it would likely take several hours while authorities worked through the risk assessment process. Food and shelter had been arranged for passengers who required it at the Queenstown Event Centre. Queenstown Lakes District mayor Glyn Lewers said the the event centre had accommodated approximately 200 passengers that were evacuated. Lewers said about 11.30am they were waiting for the Defence Force to arrive from Christchurch. Police advised people to avoid the airport and there were no flights in or out of Queenstown during the incident. Do you know more? Email newsroomstuff.co.nz Further updates on flight details were to be provided on the Queenstown Airport Facebook page. Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said due to the incident, four inbound flights had been cancelled, and one flight had returned to Christchurch. Six outbound flights from Queenstown had also been cancelled. They were flights to Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. We apologise to our passengers for the disruption, especially as this has happened at the end of the busy school holidays period. Safety is our number one priority, and we are working with the relevant authorities, Morgan said. A Jetstar spokesperson said two flights have been affected by the incident so far. Wnaka resident Hayley Barbour said her mother-in-law, also from Wnaka, had her flight cancelled and was waiting in the rain with other passengers in one of the airport's car parks, about 10.30am, as they were being moved by bus to the event centre. Barbour said they had been advised that the delays would be a few hours. Louella, her mother-in-law, was catching a flight on her way to her great-niece's wedding tomorrow, and had caught an early bus from Wnaka to the airport, to make sure she was on time. But one hour later, Barbour said Air New Zealand had been amazing and Louella was booked on another flight tomorrow morning to get to the wedding. It was a shame that the family had got more information from Facebook than the airport had given to passengers waiting outside, she said. A person who walked past the airport said police were everywhere. Tom Clarke and Luisa Navanteri, a couple from Sydney, were waiting at the airport for a flight that was supposed to leave at 2.25pm and had been pushed back to 3.30pm. They had been in Queenstown for a week on holiday and said they presumed that the flight was still going ahead. When they arrived at the airport, they were told nothing and said security was just as much in the dark. We have just been waiting here, Navanteri said. They had heard there was a bomb threat but were waiting around to see if there would be an update. Clarke said it was a little bit frustrating but it is just one of those things. NZ 'dark pop' singer and songwriter Michele Ducray was supposed to be on her way up to Auckland to promote the release of her new EP Throne of Mine when she was moved away from the airport by security. When I was walking up to the airport, security just started rushing everyone out and mass crowds started forming, Ducray said. She was told to go to the field by the 'welcome to the airport' sign and confirmed security were in the dark about the situation as well. It was not until everybody went online that they found out it was a bomb threat, she said. Ducray said everybody felt confused and inconvenienced.

We can say the third terminal is the first milestone to realise Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's dream to make Bangladesh an aviation hub, Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (Caab) chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman told BSS today. He said the PM will partially open the new scenic terminal witnessing the trial of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight from the new establishment. The Caab chairman said 90 percent work of the new terminal has been done for the soft launching, and from Saturday airlines would be able to use the new parking bay of the terminal. The third terminal will be fully operational for use by passengers at the end of next year after completion of systems integration and calibration. The new terminal will change the country's image with all world-class amenities and passenger services, said the Caab chief. He said the third terminal's features, with immaculate floor and eye-catching patterns on ceiling and sufficient natural light, are very sophisticated. Passengers will appreciate the world-class facilities of the new terminal which we never had here before, he added. The 12 boarding gates with double entry bridges will be operational by next year while an additional 14 boarding bridges are expected to be installed afterwards. The third terminal project, costing Tk 21,300 crore, commenced on December 28, 2019. The government contributed Tk 5,000 crore, while the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided the remaining funds. Covering an area of 5,42,000 square metres, the third terminal will boast a floor space of 2,30,000 square metres, housing 115 check-in counters, 66 departure immigration desks, 59 arrival immigration and 3 VIP immigration desks. Upon full-fledged operation of the terminal, Dhaka airport's annual passenger and cargo handling capacity is expected to double. The annual passenger handling capacity of the HSIA would be 24 million (including the old terminals) which is now only eight million and the airport can handle 5,00,000 tonnes of cargo each year. The construction work of 37 new aircraft parking areas and two taxiways connecting to the apron area have already been completed.

Multiple flights were cancelled and people were taken to Queenstown Events Centre before the New Zealand Defence Force bomb squad arrived. Queenstown Airport chief executive Glen Sowry said a potential security threat item was detected by Aviation Security during routine baggage screening at the airport. He said aviation security flagged an electronic device as a possible threat when it was spotted during bag screening. Sowry said the device was packed next to a computer inside the bag and it looked highly suspicious and risky. It turned out to be a device used for heating boots. The Aviation Security Service escalated this issue, which led to an evacuation of the Queenstown Airport terminal, and the airport was closed from 8.40am to 3pm yesterday. About 250 passengers were transported by bus to the Queenstown Events Centre, near the airport, and were provided with food, drinks and activities until the airport reopened. Sowry said it was a challenging day with the flight cancellations, and backlogs were likely to continue for the next three days. The good thing is that a number of airlines are putting on extra flights over the next couple of days, both domestically and across the Tasman, doing all they can to get their passengers to their destinations as quickly as possible, Sowry said. He said affected travellers who faced delays or cancellations should contact their airlines. We know that the airlines are doing everything they can to re-accommodate people and to put them on flights. The best option is just to get in touch with them, Sowry said. Passengers were ushered off a grounded plane and people were evacuated from the airport buildings as emergency services responded to the threat, which was reported about 8.40am. The passengers disembarked from the Star Alliance plane and walked across the tarmac to the far carpark at the airport, where police were stationed outside the main terminal. A police spokesman said they received a report of what appears to be an explosive device, and the terminal was evacuated as a safety precaution. Musician Michele Ducray, who was due to fly from Queenstown to Auckland for a show and radio interview, said the atmosphere at the airport was crazy. It is been absolutely insane, Ducray told the Otago Daily Times yesterday afternoon. We heard over the intercom that flights were being cancelled and it was going to be closed for a while. Everyone was all over the place, these people in security vests were ushering people out. Ducray said it was not until she checked online that she discovered it was a bomb threat. We got a message that it was due to a security incident; it was really confusing. She has had to reschedule her flights and show to Wednesday. The New Zealand Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit arrived at the airport to assess and respond to a report of what appeared to be an explosive device, Sowry said. A controlled investigation of the baggage was conducted by the unit, which determined the reported item posed no threat. Throughout the course of the day, 25 flights were disrupted or cancelled, until an Air New Zealand flight from Sydney landed about 3.15pm. An airport spokesman said food and shelter was arranged for passengers who needed it. Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said the airline apologised for the disruption to passengers.

The airport will be conducting the full-scale training exercise from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday. The exercises, mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration, happen every three years. This year, the Operation Convergent scenario will reenact a runway incursion leading to a collision between two commercial planes, airport officials said in a media release, involving over 150 passengers and crew combined. A runway incursion, sometimes referred to as a near-miss, occurs when an aircraft, vehicle, or person is improperly positioned on an airport's runway, according to the FAA. Close calls between commercial aircraft are occurring more frequently than previously thought, a recent New York Times investigation found, including multiple recent incidents in South Florida. For Thursday's simulated incursion, dozens of people from the airport and the community will roleplay as injured passengers and reuniting family members, the release said. First responders will conduct search and rescue and triage operations, transporting the wounded to a simulated hospital. The exercise will also include controlled fire, the release said. Around 30 different agencies will participate in total, including the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration, the Florida Department of Transportation, the Broward Sheriff's Office, and Broward County Emergency Management. The exercise will take place at the northwest portion of the airfield near the North Runway, the release said, but will have minimal impact on actual airport operations, besides potentially unnerving passing travelers or drivers who do not know what is going on. Participants will enter at Gate 257, located at Southwest 34th Street and West Perimeter Road. The training exercise comes amid heightened concerns over near-misses on and off airports. Close calls between commercial planes occur far more often than people previously thought, the New York Times reported in August. Many of them happen on runways, and are fueled by staffing shortages; nearly all air traffic control facilities are understaffed. Two of the recent near-misses cited in the article occurred in South Florida, at the Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports. In Fort Lauderdale, on May 8, a controller cleared a Delta jet to approach the airport, putting it on a path to collide with a Spirit flight that also had been told to approach. An F.A.A. safety manager told colleagues that the controller's actions were in a word, disturbing. The last disaster drill at the Fort Lauderdale airport, Operation Silver Lining, occurred in November of 2020, according to a county media release. That exercise simulated the emergency landing of a commercial plane.",0,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article,"Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport will conduct a full-scale training exercise Thursday. The exercise will reenact a runway incursion leading to a collision between two commercial planes. Over 150 passengers and crew combined will take part in the exercise. The exercises are mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration and take place every three years, airport officials say. For Thursday's simulated incursion, dozens of people from the airport and the community will roleplay as injured passengers and reuniting family members, the release says."

Police Major Deejay Domingo, chief of the BSA Police Station of the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group, said that they have doubled security in the airport to prevent untoward incidents. Tighter security was imposed after the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) placed all 42 commercial airports in the country on heightened security alert after its Air Traffic Service received a warning via electronic mail that aircraft from Manila bound to Puerto Princesa City, Mactan-Cebu, Bicol, and Davao International Airports are about to be set off by a bomb. Roel Aranzado, BSA manager, stressed that intelligence reports from the PNP-Aviation Security Group did not find a real-time threat to BSA. However, we are putting all security units into heightened alert in compliance with the CAAP directive, such as increasing the number of security personnel at critical areas, he said. Domingo said the situation at BSA is normal but he noted that tightened measures should be implemented to ensure the safety of travelers. As part of tighter security protocols, Domingo said they are conducting continuous monitoring, random patrolling and checking of airport terminals, intensified perimeter security, and reiterated to airport guards to properly check passengers coming in and out of the airport.

The sheriff's office said deputies responded to a three-vehicle crash on westbound I-275 near the 5.3 mile marker just before 2 p.m. Deputies said cars were slowing down to nearly a stop due to a different crash when a man driving a Ford F350 collided with the rear of the Kia Soul in front of him. Officials said the Kia Soul then crashed into the UPS delivery van in front of it, and the initial impact also caused the F350 to hit the delivery van as well. Both the F350 and the Kia Soul then hit the guardrail. The driver of the Kia Soul, 70-year-old Randy Yelton of Aurora, Ind., was taken to UC Medical Center with life-threatening injuries. The passenger, 67-year-old Kristina Yelton, was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital where she was later pronounced dead. No charges have been filed at this time as the investigation into the crash remains ongoing. Officials said deputies do believe inattention was a contributing factor in the crash. All lanes of traffic were closed throughout the initial investigation but have since been reopened.

All outbound services were immediately cancelled while any flights were advised of the situation and diverted to Dublin Airport instead. Flights in and out of Shannon remain cancelled on Monday morning while the airport is not expected to reopen until later in the day when weather conditions improve. It is very rare that Shannon is forced to closed as a result of poor visibility. Usually Shannon is the airport that handles flights from Cork, Knock and Dublin when visibility is poor there. On Sunday night, however, dense fog forced authorities to close the airport after visibility dropped below safe operating limits. The poor visibility at Shannon was compounded by ongoing essential works being undertaken on a taxiway at the airport. This prevented the airport from implementing 'low visibility procedures' which they would otherwise have been able to. A number of flights to and from Shannon were cancelled while no flights have operated in or out since the airport was closed shortly after 11.00pm last night. Several inbound flights which were already on approach to Shannon opted to divert to Dublin Airport. In a statement this morning, a Shannon Airport spokesperson said: Due to unexpected heavy fog conditions during a period of essential taxiway maintenance work, Shannon Airport remains temporarily closed. As a result, flights in and out of Shannon Airport may be cancelled or delayed this morning, Monday 9th October. Passengers are advised to check their flight status directly with the airline in advance of travelling to the airport. The runway is expected to reopen later this morning once the fog clears, subject to weather conditions. We will continue to update passengers across our social media channels. Meanwhile, the Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter was prevented from landing at University Hospital Galway (UHG) last night as a result of poor visibility. Rescue 115 had been tasked to airlift a patient to hospital from Inis Orr, the smallest of the Aran Islands. The helicopter crew had planned to fly the patient to UHG. However, on approach to the hospital, visibility was too poor to attempt an approach or landing. As a result, the helicopter flew the patient to University Hospital Limerick before returning to land in Shannon before the airport was forced to close. The flights that diverted to Dublin Airport last night include Ryanair flights from Manchester, Stansted, Fuerteventura, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Malta and Porto.

At Ben Gurion airport only Terminal 3 is operating and Terminal 1 has been temporarily closed. 60,000 passengers are expected to pass through Ben Gurion airport today, including many Israelis returning home from vacations abroad and soldiers cutting short overseas stays to return to their army units. Many foreign carriers including Lufthansa, Air France and Wizz Air have cancelled all flights to and from Israel, due to problems about insurance coverage, which does not allow them to fly to Israel during time of war. Technically airlines do not need to compensate passengers for canceled flights during war time, which is considered 'force majeure,' but in practice these airlines will likely issue alternative tickets at a later date or repay passenger fares. Passengers wishing to cancel flights can do so within 14 business days of booking the flight but are required to pay a 5 or NIS 100 cancellation fee. Israeli airlines are being flexible on this matter and have added flights abroad for Israelis wishing to return home. Extra flights have been added to Bucharest, Prague and Athens. Arkia is permitting travelers to cancel their flights over the next three days by email without any cancellation fee. El Al has said there are no changes in its flight schedules but travelers abroad can bring forward their flight home to before October 13 free of charge, while passengers due to fly abroad before October 13 can freeze their tickets without any fees. Passengers abroad and due to return before October 13 can postpone their flight home free of charge. Israir is offering a similar flexibility. Passengers whose departure date from Tel Aviv is prior to October 13, will be able to cancel or postpone their trip without cancellation fees and receive a voucher for future redemption of the amount. Passengers who want to bring forward their flight to Israel and return before October 13, will be able to do so without fees depending on the available seats on the flight. Passengers who are abroad wanting to postpone their return to Israel will also be able to do so free of charge depending on available seats on the flights. Israir asks the passengers to notify the company of canceling their arrival in order to allow other passengers to arrive in Israel.

Please try again later verifyErrors  The Department of Labor launched inquiries into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after reports of children's grueling working conditions at the companies' plants surfaced. There are currently US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division investigations open at Perdue and Tyson Foods. No additional details can be provided as the investigations are ongoing, a Labor Department spokesperson told CBS News. The federal probe into the poultry producers comes after a bombshell report published in New York Times Magazine that zeroed in on the disturbing details of a 14-year-old boy who came from Guatemala to Virginia in order to support his family by working the overnight shifts at a Perdue plant. His arm was nearly torn off while working at a slaughterhouse, the article reported. The article also documented other cases of children conducting similar work at the Perdue plant, as well as at a nearby Tyson plant. These two companies produce one in three pounds of poultry consumed in the US, the article stated. Federal law restricts individuals under age 16 from working certain hours, and prohibits minors from working in meat processing plants due to the hazardous conditions. The Independent has reached out to the Department of Labor, Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms. A spokesperson for Perdue told CBS News that the company was appalled by the illegal child labour claims. We take the legal employment and safety of each individual working in our facilities very seriously and have strict, longstanding policies in place for Perdue associates to prevent minors from working hazardous jobs in violation of the law, the spokesperson said. We recognize the systemic nature of this issue and embrace any role we can play in a solution. Tyson, however, told the outlet that it had not been made aware of an investigation, so the company did not offer a comment. The NYT Magazine article reported that the poultry producers used contractors to hire cleaning staff -- a way to circumvent accountability for skirting child labour laws. One food sanitation contractor recently was forced to pay a 1.5 million penalty for employing over 100 children to work the overnight shifts at meat processing plants across the country, a Department of Labor investigation found in February. The chief legal officer for the Department of Labor, Seema Nanda, told the New York Times the Biden administration is now looking into whether the larger companies can be held responsible. We are long past the day when brands can say that they do not know that they have child labor in their supply chain, Ms Nanda said. The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Department of Labor launched inquiries into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after reports of children's grueling working conditions at the companies' plants surfaced.

DO NOT MISS: Sam Bankman-Fried: Everything to know about the disgraced investor before his trial Businesses shutdown, travel was halted, people were required to wear masks and some states instituted vaccine mandates.

Air traffic control staff hit Over in England, London's Gatwick Airport has been hit with has been forced to cap flights at the UK's second largest airport until Sunday due to sickness-related staff shortages. The airport imposed a strict daily flight cap, with takeoffs and landings at Gatwick reduced to 800 per day until October 1. Roughly 30 of the facility's air traffic control staff is currently out of action for a variety of medical reasons including covid, resulting in a slew of cancellations, according to The Points Guy. Around 164 flights are expected to be canceled during this period, with tens of thousands of passengers likely to be caught up in delays or grounded flights. More than 40 flights were cancelled over the weekend. This has been a very difficult decision but the action we have taken today means our airlines can fly reliable flight programs, which gives passengers more certainty that they will not face last minute cancellations, Stewart Wingate, chief executive of London Gatwick, said. Wingate said the airport was working with National Air Traffic Services to build resilience in the control tower, and this decision means we can prevent as much disruption as possible. NATS said in a statement that given the levels of sickness we have experienced over the last few weeks, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to limit the number of flights this week in order to reduce the risk of daily disruption to passengers using the airport. The agency added that with 30 of tower staff unavailable for a variety of medical reasons including covid, we cannot manage the number of flights that were originally planned for this week. Need for long term plan Ryanair called upon NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe to step down and promised passengers that it will not scrap flights, saying it is unacceptable that NATS has enforced this because of its failure to adequately staff. Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, Gatwick's largest operator, told The Mirror that while it is regrettable that a temporary limit on capacity at Gatwick Airport is required, we believe that it is the right action by the airport so on the day cancellations and delays can be avoided. Gatwick Airport and NATS now need to work on longer term plan so the resilience of ATC at Gatwick is improved and fit for purpose, Lundren said.. Our call for a more wide-ranging review of NATS remains so the broader issues can be examined so it can deliver robust services to passengers now and in the future. The incident comes after a major disruption at British airports last month following a technical problem at NATS, causing more than 1,500 flights to be canceled and thousands more delayed. The YOU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a program in 2021 at seven of the busiest international airports aimed at collecting Covid-19 data, Time reported in June. Officials with the CDC's meet passengers on select international flights once they clear customs and ask them to voluntarily provide nasal swabs that are pooled and tested by Ginkgo Bioworks, the CDC's lab partner. This program is critical for early detection and filling in many blind spots in global surveillance, Dr. Cindy Friedman, chief of the travelers' health branch at the CDC, said. This is really critical right now as many countries, including the YOU.S., are decreasing testing by as much as 90. It is a key piece of biosecurity.

Gatwick Airport took the decision after the pandemic affected the staff of air traffic control and consequently, the airport set a daily limit of 800 flights, affecting both arrivals and departures. The measures will stay in place until Sunday and National Air Traffic Services (NATS) confirmed that the decision was taken given the levels of sickness experienced over the last few weeks. The airport said that around 30 per cent of staff in the division within the air traffic control suffered from the pandemic, with some of them even having COVID-19. Besides, the daily cap will not enable last-minute cancellations and delays for passengers while National Air Traffic Services returns to normalcy, Schengenvisainfo reported. The severity of the crisis can be gauged from the fact that on September 25th, 50 flights to and from the London airport were cancelled or diverted; EasyJet made the most cancellations, with 42 flights affected. The Airport's Chief Executive, Stewart Wingate, highlighted that the flights were reduced to prevent further spread, acknowledging that it was a difficult decision We are working closely with NATS to build resilience in the control tower, and this decision means we can prevent as many disruptions as possible, Wingate said.

There were few initial details about the incident, as well as a rocket that struck a neighborhood just northwest of the airport, killing a child. The Taliban initially described the two strikes as separate incidents, though information on both remained scarce and witnesses heard only one large blast Sunday in the Afghan capital. The airstrike came as the United States winds down a historic airlift that saw tens of thousands evacuated from Kabul's international airport, the scene of much of the chaos that engulfed the Afghan capital since the Taliban took over two weeks ago. After an Islamic State affiliate's suicide attack that killed over 180 people, the Taliban increased its security around the airfield as Britain ended its evacuation flights Saturday. YOU.S. military cargo planes continued their runs into the airport Sunday, ahead of a Tuesday deadline earlier set by President Joe Biden to withdraw all troops from America's longest war. However, Afghans remaining behind in the country worry about the Taliban reverting to their earlier oppressive rule -- something fueled by the recent shooting death of a folk singer in the country by the insurgents. Two American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers. YOU.S. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the American military's Central Command, called the drone strike an action taken in self-defense. He said authorities continued assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time. We are confident we successfully hit the target, Urban said. Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid earlier said in a message to journalists that the YOU.S. strike targeted a suicide bomber as he drove a vehicle loaded with explosives. Mujahid offered few other details. The strike was the second by America since the airport suicide bombing. On Saturday, a strike in Nangarhar province killed an Islamic State member believed to be involved in planning attacks against the United States in Kabul. The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group's more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority, including a 2020 assault on a maternity hospital in Kabul in which they killed women and infants. The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a YOU.S.-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 911 attacks, which al-Qaida orchestrated while being sheltered by the group. The rocket attack struck Kabul's Khuwja Bughra neighborhood, said Rashid, the Kabul police chief who goes by one name. Video obtained by The Associated Press in the aftermath of the attack showed smoke rising from building at the site around a kilometer (half a mile) from the airport. No group immediately claimed the attack, however militants have fired rockets in the past. Meanwhile, the family of a folk singer north of Kabul say the Taliban killed him under unclear circumstances in recent days. The shooting of Fawad Andarabi came in the Andarabi Valley for which he was named, an area of Baghlan province some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kabul. The valley had seen upheaval since the Taliban takeover, with some districts in the area coming under the control of militia fighters opposed to the Taliban rule. The Taliban say they have since retaken those areas, though neighboring Panjshir in the Hindu Kush mountains remains the only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces not under its control. The Taliban previously came out to Andarabi's home and searched it, even drinking tea with the musician, his son Jawad Andarabi told the AP. But something changed Friday. He was innocent, a singer who only was entertaining people, his son said. They shot him in the head on the farm. His son said he wanted justice and that a local Taliban council promised to punish his father's killer. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, told the AP that the insurgents would investigate the incident, but had no other details on the killing. Andarabi played the ghichak, a bowed lute, and sang traditional songs about his birthplace, his people and Afghanistan as a whole. A video online showed him at one performance, sitting on a rug with the mountains of home surrounding him as he sang. There is no country in the world like my homeland, a proud nation, he sang. Our beautiful valley, our great-grandparents' homeland. Karima Bennoune, the United Nations special rapporteur on cultural rights, wrote on Twitter that she had grave concern over Andarabi's killing. We call on governments to demand the Taliban respect the humanrights of artists, she wrote. Agnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, similarly decried the killing. There is mounting evidence that the Taliban of 2021 is the same as the intolerant, violent, repressive Taliban of 2001, she wrote on Twitter. 20 years later. Nothing has changed on that front. Also on Sunday, private banks across Afghanistan resumed their operations. However, they limited withdrawals to no more than the equivalent of 200 a day. While some complained of still being unable to access their money, government employees say they have not been paid over the last four months. The Afghani traded around 90.5 to 1, continuing its depreciation as billions of dollars in the country's reserves remain frozen overseas.

Officials warned that low river levels risk disrupting grains exports from nearby farm states. On the Madeira, they said barge routes used by grain firms such as Cargill, Bunge and Amaggi, are open but loads are being reduced as a precaution. Shipping and logistics group A.P. Moller-Maersk warned customers on Wednesday that navigation in the area of Manaus, the largest Amazonian city, was not possible. The depth of the Amazon river at its critical points has reached a level that renders maritime operations in Manaus unfeasible, the company said. Thinning Rivers Could Disrupt Amazonian Grain Exports Maersk said in a separate statement the severe drought has hit 60 of the 62 municipalities in Amazonas state, causing cabotage service to and from Manaus to be temporarily suspended. The captain of the beached boat that tugs the barge, Junior Cesar da Silva, said he had come to pick up supplies in Manaus for Borba, 280 kilometers (175 miles) away on the Madeira, an Amazon tributarywhere water levels have fallen to record lows. As we approached, we ran aground and help came too slow to re-float my boat as the water was receding very quickly, he said in an interview. The Amazon region is under pressure from the El Nino weather phenomenon, with the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon below the historical average and river levels falling near record levels. On the Madeira, beaches and rocks are appearing that we have not seen before, Da Silva said. The heat wave and drought, linked to the mass deaths of fish and river dolphins, has limited the access to supplies by local communities that depend on rivers transport in the rainforest. Cesar said store shelves were emptying out in Borba, where his barge delivers food, drinking water, cooking gas, gasoline and building materials. Brazil's government in September set up a humanitarian task force to deliver food parcels to isolated villages and Indigenous communities. On Tuesday, Indigenous groups in the Amazon asked the Brazilian government to declare a climate emergency as their villages have no drinking water, food or medicine due to a severe drought. As part of a contingency plan, Maersk's local operator Alianca Navegacao e Logstica is diverting vessels bound to Manaus to alternative ports including Vila do Conde and Pecem. Maersk's Alianca expects to reestablish service as soon as navigability conditions allow in mid-November, with restricted capacity, according to Alianca's Brazilian website. Larry Carvalho, a lawyer specializing in logistics, said freight costs were rising as ship programming was being impacted in the Amazon, with critical situations in Manaus and on the Madeira river, where grains companies move produce. Speaking to Reuters by telephone, he said higher freight costs were affecting companies that operate in the so-called Manaus Free Trade Zone area, where fiscal incentives apply to foster the industrialization of the North of Brazil.

On Saturday, the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack against multiple Israeli towns along the fortified border with Gaza. Hamas fighters attacked Israeli soldiers and civilians alike, killing an estimated  in the initial assault. Hamas receives support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and it coordinates with its sponsors in Tehran on major operations, according to defense analysts. Citing Hamas representatives, the Wall Street Journal reports that IRGC officers were present during some of the planning meetings for Saturday's attack, and that Iran gave a green light for the operation. The Journal's sources within Hamas suggested that Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, had personally attended two of these meetings. The Biden administration has asserted that it believes Iranian leadership was surprised by the strike, and likely was not aware of the timing or the scope of the attack. If Israel decides to take retaliatory action against Iranian forces or their proxy groups, Iran could move to restrict transits through the Strait of Hormuz for tankers with Israeli or American ties. The IRGC's naval division maintains a flotilla of small attack boats, which can harass, board and seize merchant ships - or damage them. Elevated risk could raise insurance rates or reduce the supply of tankers willing to make the journey; either would have an effect on the oil market. Any shipping affiliated with Israel is especially exposed, said Cormac Mc Garry, a maritime analyst with Control Risks, speaking to Foreign Policy. Whatever pathway this takes, if Israel retaliates against Iran, and Iran attacks Israeli-affiliated shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, it will be more forceful than Iran's usual attacks on shipping in the strait. Impacts on Israeli shipping According to insurer Gard, the effects of the conflict on Israel's ports are limited, at least so far. The port of Ashkelon is officially closed, given its close proximity to Gaza, but Gard reports that the port authority is giving permission for vessels to berth and unload on a case-by-case basis. Nearby Port of Ashdod is open with restrictions, and it stands ready for business - except for certain dangerous goods cargoes. Explosives and toxic gases have been temporarily banned at the port. Maersk Line has told customers that its cargo operations in the key hub ports of Ashdod and Haifa have not been substantially affected. Road and rail connections to port hinterlands were also moving smoothly. Voyages to these ports have become much more expensive to insure, Reuters reports. War risk premiums have risen by a factor of 10, and now run as high as 0.2 percent of a ship's value. One commercial operator is unlikely to be deterred by any obstacles. Israeli shipping line ZIM, which is part-owned by the government, has declared that its fleet is available to serve the national interest as required. The company ships will be, as a priority, directed to transfer cargo from anywhere in the world to Israel according to the requirements and needs of the Ministry of Defense and the Government of Israel, said ZIM CEO Eli Glickman in a statement. ZIM will support the state of Israel in this difficult time and its first priority will be to allocate the needed resources to aid Israel in this hard and difficult situation.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'related_article'},related_article,"Hamas receives support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and it coordinates with its sponsors in Tehran on major operations.

The United Auto Workers strike finally began to take its toll on the Automotive MMI (Monthly Metals Index) as well as month-over-month steel prices. Regarding price drops, hot-dipped galvanized managed to suffer the most. And with the strike continuing to escalate, negotiations stagnating, and more and more layoffs occurring nationwide, the index faces massive bearish pressure in the immediate future. Overall, the Automotive MMI dropped by 4.51 Jeep manufacturer Stellantis announced that it has laid off more than 500 employees at the Trenton Engine Complex, as well as a smaller number of workers in Indiana. The UAW strike, which led to storage difficulties and a lack of parts, proved the primary reason for the layoff decision. At the moment, 640 Stellantis employees are currently on temporary release due to the strike. Other automakers have also witnessed impacts from the UAW's ongoing protest. Due to the strike at the Chicago Assembly Plant, Ford requested that 71 employees of the Livonia Transmission Plant not report to work on Monday, October 9. Like Stellantis, Ford also experienced a scarcity of parts due to the strike. Ultimately, General Motors (GM) had to idle an assembly plant in Kansas, resulting in the layoff of around 2,000 workers. Economic analysts estimate that the UAW strike has thus far cost the automotive sector 5.5 billion. Indeed, nearly 13,000 GM, Ford, and Stellantis employees took to picket lines over the past four weeks. The UAW has since criticized the Big Three automakers' decisions to fire workers, with union leader Shawn Fain claiming that the Big Three are using the layoffs as a strategy to put the squeeze on our members to settle for less. Ultimately, the strike continues to lower demand for auto steel, adding bearish pressure to already falling steel prices. Indeed, auto companies produced 6,030 fewer vehicles per day due to the UAW strike's effects. The cost of the UAW strike reflects the 16 days that production was halted at one assembly facility in Wentzville, Missouri, which produces mid-size pickups. Because of the strike, Ford has had to let go of around 930 employees. Meanwhile, Stellantis released at least 370 employees in Ohio and Indiana. That said, it is possible that the strike may eventually reduce steel availability and raise steel prices, though only time will tell. After overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year deal, thousands of unionized workers at Mack Trucks went on strike. According to the United Auto Workers (UAW), 73 of its members voted against the proposed agreement. The deal apparently included a 19 pay increase, a 3,500 ratification bonus, improved retirement benefits, additional vacation time for some employees, and a shorter time to reach top pay. About 4,000 Mack employees represent the UAW in three separate states. According to UAW President Shawn Fain, several issues still need to be resolved, including clauses relating to salary, work schedules, benefits, and health and safety. The latest strike is distinct from the UAW disagreement with Detroit's Big Three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, as Mack Trucks belongs to Volvo. Since September 15, the UAW has been striking specifically against the Detroit Three automakers' facilities, with around 25,000 of the 146,000 UAW workers participating. Ford agreed to enhance its salary increase to 23 over four years, potentially raising expectations for union members at Mack due to recent developments in their own negotiations. The Mack arrangement also included an immediate 10 pay hike and nine more percentage points of compensation increases over the course of the five-year contract. When the UAW decided to strike, Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said that the firm was surprised and disappointed, and that the action proved needless. In the past year, workers at FedEx and in the freight rail industry rejected tentative deals before later agreeing.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The United Auto Workers strike finally began to take its toll on the Automotive MMI (Monthly Metals Index) as well as month-over-month steel prices.

The job progressed without incident and afterwards, the two crew proceeded to clean the carbon and other debris on the poop deck. One of the crew was holding the lance of the pressure washer when he inadvertently pressed the trigger. The sudden pressure surge produced a hydraulic kick-back force in the lance, and the water jet hit him on his left leg just above the knee. The victim screamed and released the trigger and the lance.

This is the latest in a string of indications that the conflict in the Middle East may be escalating, after reports that Israel was strengthening its military presence along the border with Lebanon - home of the Islamist group Hezbollah. We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially toward targets in Israel, said Brigadier General Pat Ryder at a Pentagon briefing following the news of the missile interception, as quoted by the AP and the Times of Israel. Separately, the AP reported, citing an unnamed YOU.S. official, that there had been another strike, this time in Iraq, targeting YOU.S. and coalition partner forces at a diplomatic center near Baghdad International Airport. Per the reports, the missiles were launched by the Houthis who currently control Yemen and are affiliated with Iran's government. With them came several drones, the reports added. ABC noted this was the first time in recent history that a YOU.S. Navy ship had struck back at missiles and drones that were not targeting it.

Starr Indemnity  Liability Company acting as the subrogee of Target filed suit in the Southern District of New York on October 19 seeking more than 5.8 million. The suit stems from an incident aboard the Maersk Eidenoven containership (13,100 TEU) which happened on February 17, 2021, while the vessel was sailing approximately 45 nautical miles off the coast of Northern Japan. Maersk reported at the time that the vessel experienced an engine stop in heavy seas causing the ship to be unable to maneuver and experience a severe roll. They later determined that the engines on the 11-year-old ship shut down when an indicator recorded low engine oil pressure triggering a safety feature. Propulsion power was quickly restored on the vessel, but it returned to Japan. While in Yokohama, they discharged 65 damaged containers and inspected the bays. The survey showed that the vessel had lost 260 containers in the ocean east of Japan. Maersk said however that there was only minor damage to the vessel and all the required welding and repairs could be completed in Yokohama. The vessel resumed its voyage to Los Angeles at the beginning of March. The lawsuit states that between January 12 and February 4, cargo was delivered to the ports of Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Yaintan, Chia for transport aboard the Maersk Eidenhoven to California. They believe that a total of approximately 57 containers were delivered to Maersk containing various consumer goods. When the Maersk Eidenhoven reached its port of discharge, the suit says Maersk failed to discharge the containers and deliver the cargo in good order. They believe the entire cargo was lost overboard with the suit alleging negligence or breach of duty by the defendants, Maersk and the Maersk Eidenhoven. The suit values the cargo at just over 5.8 million, but reports they have not been paid for the cargo. The insurer reserves the right to increase the value of loss while also seeking a judgment against Maersk and the vessel. Further, they are asking the court to arrest the vessel and order it to be sold to satisfy the judgment. While the case will likely be resolved by Maersk and its insurers, it highlights the continued challenges for the industry over the loss of containers. The years 2020 and 2021 were especially bad for the industry with large casualties mostly related to weather. Nearly 4,000 boxes went overboard in 2020 and a further 2,000 in 2021, according to data from the World Shipping Council. The industry has focused on how large vessels handle in bad seas as one step toward reducing container losses. Multiple companies are also working on devices or systems to better secure containers while they are in the racks and reduce movement in bad weather conditions. The World Shipping Council reported losses had been dramatically reduced to just over 660 boxes in 2022.

China Sea,"Early Sunday morning, the Philippine Coast Guard was escorting a resupply run to the military outpost on Second Thomas Shoal when a China Coast Guard cutter collided with a Philippine supply boat in the convoy, the PCG said in a statement. Later in the same mission, a Chinese maritime militia trawler bumped a PCG patrol vessel. The resupply runs to Second Thomas Shoal involve tense standoffs between the China Coast Guard and the Philippine Coast Guard, and the PCG has to carry out its mission despite resistance from multiple Chinese vessels. China claims ownership of the Spratly Islands and surrounding waters, including areas within the Philippine exclusive economic zone, like Second Thomas Shoal. Beijing has repeatedly ordered Manila to withdraw its garrison from the Philippine station - a wrecked LST, intentionally grounded on the reef 24 years ago - but Philippine forces have held out, and the resupply missions keep bypassing the Chinese blockade. In previous confrontations, Chinese forces have used aggressive maneuvering, water cannons and laser target illuminators to deter Philippine supply boats. The PCG has long warned that these tactics increase the risk of collision, and Sunday's mission appears to confirm that prediction. At about 0600 hours Sunday morning, China Coast Guard cutter CCG 5203 engaged in dangerous blocking maneuvers to cut off a contracted Philippine supply boat, Unaiza May 2, according to the PCG. The maneuver resulted in a collision at a position about 13 nautical miles away from the station on Second Thomas Shoal. During the same operation, a Chinese maritime militia vessel - pennant number 00003 - made contact with the Philippine patrol vessel MRRV 4409 on the port side. The other Philippine supply vessel in the convoy, Unaiza May 1, made it through to the outpost to deliver supplies and replacement personnel. In a statement, the Philippine government's task force for the South China Sea called the Chinese blockade force's actions dangerous, irresponsible and illegal, as well as a violation of Philipping sovereignty and jurisdiction. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that China's historically-based claims to the South China Sea are without merit under international law. China has ignored the ruling and has deployed its gray zone forces - white-hulled coast guard cutters and militia-operated commercial fishing trawlers - to enforce its claims. Philippines suspends military exchange program with China As maritime confrontation between China and Philippines escalates in the South China Sea, the Philippines has suspended its military exchange program with Beijing. The move is a protest by the Philippines over numerous run-ins with the China Coast Guard. Speaking to local media last week, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Philippines (AFP), General Romeo Brawner Jr., said that the decision to suspend the military exchange program with China was contemplated after an August incident in which a Chinese coast guard vessel sprayed water cannons at Philippines military transport ships in Spratly islands. The military exchange program between Manila and Beijing was launched in 2007. It entails Philippines sending five military officers (in the rank of lieutenant colonel or higher) to China for 6-12 months of training every year. The Philippine National Police Academy also sends some of its cadets for specialized training to the Beijing Military Academy and other training facilities run by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). With diplomatic relations between Beijing and Manila increasingly strained, a group of Filipino senators in August demanded that AFP explain why the military exchange program still exists while China continues to harass Philippines. This is indeed alarming. This has to be explained. We have not been accepting cadets from our military treaty ally while we have been sending our soldiers to the country harassing us in the West Philippine Sea. What is the rationale behind this?, said Senator Francis Tolentino during a public hearing of the Senate Committee on national defense and security in August.",1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"China claims ownership of the Spratly Islands and surrounding waters, including areas within the Philippine exclusive economic zone.

Two people have died in Scotland, including Wendy Taylor, who was swept away in the Water of Lee, Glen Esk. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said river levels across the north and north east remained high. But no rain is forecast for the next two days. Angus councillor Gavin Nicol said the full extent of the damage in the Angus town of Brechin had yet to be established. Mr Nicol admitted the town's flood defences, which were upgraded in 2016, now needed to be reviewed. He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: I am hoping the first minister will take pity on us and give us more money for Angus Council. Mr Yousaf is also expected to thank volunteers, the local council and the emergency services for their work in supporting people evacuated from their properties. Speaking ahead of the visit, he said: My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives to the extreme conditions caused by Storm Babet during what will be difficult time. I want to pass on my thanks to local authorities, volunteers and the emergency services for all their efforts in these extremely challenging conditions. Mr Yousaf praised the community for coming together to support those affected and said Angus Council had received hundreds of offers of alternative accommodation for those forced to leave their homes. He added: The process of assessing the full amount of damage caused in all areas affected by the storm is now under way. This will take some time and we are working closely with local authorities to support the people and businesses affected. On Sunday Mr Nicol, who represents the Brechin and Edzell Ward, warned that some residents whose homes were flooded would not be home in time for Christmas. He said parts of the town were still coated in contaminated sludge and silt. Asked when some people would be get back into their homes he told The Sunday Show: It will be an extensive period. A 56-year-old man was killed on the same day as Ms Taylor, 57, after a falling tree hit a van near Forfar in Angus. The storm has also claimed two lives in England, a man in his 60s in Shropshire and a woman in her 80s in Chesterfield. A man who is said to have been trapped in a vehicle in floodwater in Marykirk, Aberdeenshire, remains missing. Meanwhile, the A90 remains closed between Dundee and Stonehaven as experts inspect the road and bridge structures. Energy firm SSEN said it restored power to 37,000 customers during the storm and fixed more than 450 faults across its network. It also confirmed households impacted by power cuts for more than 12 hours were entitled to 30 per person, for every day without power, to cover food and drink costs. SSEN urged customers to keep hold of receipts and claim costs back via its website. ScotRail said most services would be back to normal on Monday but some may start later in the morning in Fife. It added that the Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh line would remain closed until at least Tuesday. The Aberdeen - Elgin route has reopened but the Aberdeen - Dundee line remains closed. Customers are advised to check the ScotRail website before they travel. Scott Prentice, interim commercial director, said: Unfortunately, we are still seeing some extremely challenging conditions on the rail network in Fife, the northeast, and the far north caused by the most rainfall experienced in Scotland since 1891. Our first priority is always the safety of customers and staff, and we will not run services until we are absolutely sure the lines are safe.

Ticket offices across the country face closure under controversial plans that unions and campaigners say will lead to job losses and difficulties for passengers such as the elderly and disabled in paying for travel. In the letter, dated October 20 and signed by Conservative MP and committee chair Iain Stewart, MPs also express concern about the 'unacceptable' lack of information about the proposals from operators, the Rail Delivery Group and the Department for Transport. Plans that would see the widespread closure of ticket offices go 'too far, too fast', cross-party MPs have warned Commons Transport Committee chair Iain Stewart (pictured) has written to rail minister Huw Merriman to express concern about how office closures would impact on disabled passengers Mr Stewart told the minister: 'We therefore consider that the proposals as put forward by train operating companies in this consultation go too far, too fast, towards a situation that risks excluding some passengers from the railway. 'At a minimum, changes this radical should be carefully piloted in limited areas and evaluated for their effect on all passengers before being rolled out. 'This would allow for the alternative proposals, which at present are too vague, to be properly understood.' The letter notes that while it is acceptable for operators to adapt to changing passenger behaviour, many passengers have 'legitimate concerns about whether closing a ticket office would remove the support they need'. Mr Merriman is expected to respond to the letter in due course. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: 'While these are industry proposals, we have been consistently clear that the industry must ensure that the quality of service for passengers is maintained to a high standard.

Mrs Gilbert's son shaken Paul Gilbert today told how his mother dead on the bottom floor of her flooded home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He had desperately tried all he could to protect her house on Friday morning spending hours putting up flood defences and believing the near 4ft-high flood barrier would be enough to stop the waters. He had heaved her bed upstairs in case the worst happened and an hour after he left at around midday he received a panicked phone call from Maureen saying the waters were seeping through into her home. He asked her to get all of her stuff ready and to go upstairs before making the seven hour journey back where he discovered her home was flooded. Firefighters smashed the rear window but were unable to gain access to the property despite the water 'being up to Paul's eyes' and they stopped the doting son from trying to get in himself, he claimed. They promised Paul they would try again on Saturday morning but after waiting for a call that never came, the son went to his mother's home at 9.30am and forced the window open where he discovered Maureen dead floating in the water.

It smells like poo. 'It is horrendous. Everything in the out house has ended up on the back. 'We have just had it redecorated as we have had a burst pipe under the kitchen. We have had to have a new bathroom and a new kitchen. Now it is water damaged and we have got to rip the whole house out. 'My little boy cannot work out why we cannot go back in.

Flooding devastates the Derbyshire town of Chesterfield, where a woman in her 80s was found dead on Saturday A local in Chesterfield gets a piggyback from a rescue worker as he is carried out of a flood-stricken street Pensioner Mrs Gilbert had lived in the street all of her life, her heartbroken family said on Sunday, after detailing how her son and grandson found her body at home on the morning of October 21 despite efforts to waterproof the house. Maureen, who neighbours said had barely left the house in years, lived downstairs in the two-story home as she had mobility problems and was unable to go upstairs; when water flooded into her home at 'chest height' she was unable to escape.

Her daughter-in-law has told how chest-high flood defences in the doorways were overcome when the River Rother burst outside, with water 'pouring over at rapid speed'. In a crowdfunding appeal, Kaye Gilbert said the property in Tapton Terrace, Chesterfield, had previously flooded in 2007. It was not insured because the family had been quoted a 10,000 excess to clean and restore it following flood damage. Teaching assistant Mrs Gilbert, 47, lives in the nearby village of Clowne with husband Paul, also 47, a landscape gardener. She wrote: 'After a sleepless night, my husband and son found my 83 year old, housebound, mother-in-law, had passed away. 'She had unfortunately been unable to escape upstairs at the speed the water levels were rising. 'Not only do we have an uninsured house as the excess for flood damage was over 10,000 to clean and restore but a funeral to pay for all whilst grieving. 'She lived on the street all her life, rebuilding after the 2007 flood was hard for us and her but this is just devastating. We now only have memories as everything else is gone. 'My husband put his mothers flood defences up to his chest in the doorways and made preparations to secure the house as he has done many times during such weather warnings. 'However, when the river burst, the water just came pouring over at rapid speed and the defences did very little. 'The waters were much higher than the 2007 flood and came with a faster flow and pressure which resulted in my husband being stopped from trying to enter the property to check on his mum.' Neighbours said Mrs Gilbert had been housebound for around three years and is thought to have been attended to daily by carers. A nearby resident told the Mail widower Mrs Gilbert, who had a second son, John, 44, had been bed-bound and unable to escape the raging torrent. 'I spoke to one of her neighbours who said she was bedbound', the resident said. 'The water has come up above the bed. 'It is awful. It is given me nightmares thinking about that poor lady.'

'It was coming in so fast', she added. 'It would have been just the same on the other side at Tapton Terrace. These areas are always amongst the first locations in Chesterfield to flood.' Mrs Gilbert's husband, Jack, died in 1997 at the age of 67. Derbyshire Constabulary said an investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found at a property in Chesterfield. A spokesman said officers were called to a 'sudden death' on Saturday morning with colleagues from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service and from East Midlands Ambulance Service. They found 'a woman, aged in her 80s, inside the flat.' The spokesman added: 'The woman was found in a flooded property. Enquiries are ongoing into the circumstances of her death. But the because of her death is unascertained at this time.' A major incident was declared in the county on Friday due to rising river levels, but Derbyshire Dales District Council this afternoon said major incident status had been removed in the county as river levels in the upper Derwent began to fall. Heartbroken Paul has been back to the mid-terraced house today to try to salvage any sodden belongings from the property. A heartbroken friend today said of Maureen: 'She was such a character, she was a massive football fan, she was a big Liverpool fan and followed Chesterfield too. 'I am devastated, it is just heartbreaking it could have been allowed to happen. I think questions need to be asked. 'Surely there should be a central database of housebound residents so they can be made a priority for help?' Derby City Council said they are seeing record-breaking water levels in the River Derwent - which left much of the village of Sandiacre underwater - and warned that cleaning up after the floods could take several days. Mrs Gilbert's is believed to be the ninth linked to Storm Babet, which arrived in the UK late on Wednesday causing chaos on the roads, railways and in local communities which have been devastated by flood waters.

Hours later, a 56-year-old man was killed by a falling tree close to Forfar, 20 miles away; police say he was pronounced dead at the scene. A man in his 60s was swept away by flood waters in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire on Friday. Elsewhere, police are said to be treating a crash in Halifax that killed a 19-year-old man and a pile-up on the M4 that killed two women, both on Friday, as being related to the inclement weather conditions. And a man and a woman were killed after their car plunged from a bridge near Skipton, North Yorkshire, on Saturday afternoon; officers have not stated whether the car left the bridge as a result of the stormy winds and heavy rain. A search is also under way in Aberdeenshire after police received a report of a man trapped in a vehicle in floodwater. On Sunday, Nottinghamshire County Council declared a major incident in the town of Retford, which sits on the River Idle, and has advised residents of some 500 homes to leave. Water levels on the Idle hit 2.56m as of 12pm on Sunday - the previous record was 2.4m in 2007. In Retford, emergency services have been seen speaking to people on their doorsteps as water pours into residential streets up to knee height. Lifelong resident Brendan Hunt, 54, detailed how he moved as many of his possessions upstairs as possible, placing other furniture and appliances on wooden blocks eight inches off the ground in a bid to minimise the risk of water damage. He said: 'Water was coming up through the storm drains and it just got deeper and deeper until one side of the road's water joined the other side of the road. 'Then it filled the pavements, then it filled everybody's gardens. It got to within millimetres of coming in the front door. 'It is still right up to the threshold of the front door... the Environment Agency says before 8pm tonight there is another 30cm on its way.' Nottinghamshire County Council said in a statement issued Sunday: 'These Severe Flood Warnings have been issued because of flooding in Thrumpton, Retford, as a result of Storm Babet. 'Residents in all of these areas are being asked to prepare to evacuate their homes. Emergency services are supporting residents to evacuate where needed. Please make sure you leave your homes when directed to do so.' Elsewhere in Nottinghamshire, nearly 50 horses and ponies were evacuated after floodwater deluged the St Leonard's Riding School And Livery Stable in Toton. Sally Carnelley, 69, and her daughter Tara, 39, keep about 22 of their own horses and ponies on-site, also caring for some 28 livery horses. Ms Carnelley told the PA news agency: 'It is devastating.

And even as the storm abates, forecasters have already issued a fresh weather warning as a cold snap looks set to bite overnight into Monday. The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' warning for ice covering most of mainland Scotland as well as parts of northern England; the forecaster warns Brits to expect 'icy patches' and to take care to avoid 'slips and falls on icy surfaces'. The yellow weather warning stretches from the very top of Scotland down to Corbridge, around 20 miles west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and runs from 9pm on Sunday until 9am Monday. The warning covers the major Scottish cities as well as the Angus and Aberdeenshire regions, which have been devastated by flooding during Storm Babet. Temperatures will hover just above freezing in the Highlands and Borders regions overnight, according to the forecaster; further south, overnight temperatures will be a relatively balmy 12-13C. While Babet has passed, the storm has flooded out Britain's rail network; Environment Agency bosses say that flooding is likely to last until Tuesday. Katharine Smith, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, says teams have been sent to the worst-affected areas to operate flood barriers and put up temporary defences, including pumps to get rid of flood waters. She added: 'Following persistent, heavy rain from Storm Babet, severe river flooding impacts are probable in parts of the East Midlands and South Yorkshire...into Sunday. 'Ongoing flooding is probable on some larger rivers including the Severn, Ouse and Trent through to Tuesday. 'We also advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.' In Brechin, east Scotland, where hundreds of people have been evacuated, local councillors say some residents are unlikely to get home before Christmas after river levels surged to more than five metres. Local authority Angus Council had spent millions on a flood defence scheme for the region that was meant to provide protection against a 'one-in-200 year' flood; the works for the 3.8m barriers were completed just seven years ago. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Show, local Tory representative Gavin Nicol said: 'There is sludge and silt everywhere - it is contaminated sludge and silt - and it will take a fair bit of cleaning up. 'It will be an extensive period - it will take a fair bit of sorting...these houses will not be ready by Christmas. 'I am hoping the First Minister will take pity on us and give us some more money for Angus Council.' Brechin residents who returned to their homes on Sunday found 'mind-blowing' devastation caused after the South Esk burst its banks. David Stewart, 68, said: 'It is just absolutely mind-blowing. The devastation looks even worse than I thought.' Brian Petrie, 66, returned to find the lower floor of his house covered in silt and mud, with the carpet squelching as he walked and the fridge upended. His 92-year-old mother had to be rescued, as he recalled: 'The Coastguards and paramedics got her down the stairs in a stretcher and took her in a dinghy up to the ambulance.' George Wilson, 66, returned to find 'awful' damage in his home, adding: 'I am still trying to get my head around it.' In remarks reported by the Press and Journal, Angus Council environmental officer Jacqui Semple said there may be some residents who will never be able to return to their homes after the floods. She told a media briefing: 'There remains concern that parts of River Street could completely give way and it is unlikely that some residents will (ever) be able to return to their homes. 'The amount of water that flooded onto the street was significant and the full extent of the damage is unknown. 'Parts of the road have completely crumbled away and that could have a significant impact on the future of the street.'

Throughout Sunday, disruption is expected on LNER, Scotrail, Northern, Transpennine Express, Greater Anglia, Transport for Wales, CrossCountry and East Midlands Railway services. LNER has advised its customers to not travel north of Edinburgh, and there are no services operating from the city towards Aberdeen or Inverness. ScotRail said routes remain closed between Aberdeen and Dundee, and Aberdeen and Elgin. The Scottish train operator said they can not run services on the Fife Circle route, or between Inverness and Wick, Thurso and Kyle of Lochalsh. Services are also disrupted across parts of Yorkshire and East Anglia with some routes still flooded, Network Rail said. LNER said urgent repairs are taking place at Plessey Viaduct and there is a limited service between Morpeth and Newcastle. Caledonian Sleeper services are said to be running as normal between Scotland and London - but there is a 'high probability' of them being affected. Routes across the East Midlands have been suspended or partially suspended until Monday; East Midlands Railway says it will honour tickets bought for the weekend until the end of Tuesday. In a statement published on its website on Sunday morning, National Rail said: 'Disruption to trains is expected on some routes until the end of the day. Please check your whole journey before travelling.' Clean-ups are underway in communities across the country as the flood waters finally began to subside. Derby City Council said they are seeing record-breaking water levels in the River Derwent - which left much of the village of Sandiacre underwater - and warned that cleaning up after the floods could take several days. Wedding photographer Harvey Morgans, who captured dramatic footage of the submerged streets, was left stunned by what he saw on his drone. He said: 'It is affected everyone on the street, devastated a lot of people's houses and livelihoods. 'The knock on effect over the next few months - people replacing cars and fixing property - will be massive.' It comes as 59 people and 12 animals were rescued from flooded homes in neighbouring Stapleford. In Sheffield, South Yorkshire, 120 homes have been evacuated in the Catcliffe area after devastating flooding. The River Rother reached heights of 30.44m, exceeding the level it reached in 2007 when the area was ravaged by disastrous floods. Derbyshire Fire Service said more than 100 people had to be rescued in the county on Friday, including 20 people at a care home in Duffield. In Wales, a severe flood warning had been issued for the village of Llandrinio, Powys, as well as isolated properties in the Severn-Vyrnwy confluence area.

The rig is located around 146 miles east of Aberdeen. Stena Drilling said four out of eight anchors became detached from the drilling unit because of the severe weather. Rest centres were set up in Angus with more than 50 people opting to stay in one in Brechin after they were evacuated from their homes as the River South Esk breached the town's flood defences early on Friday morning. Residents of nearby Bridge of Dun had to be airlifted via helicopter, while in other areas people stranded by flood waters were rescued by boats, including canoes. Scottish justice secretary Angela Constance, who chaired a government meeting on the country's 'exceptional' rainfall on Saturday, said: 'The impact will be felt in communities for some time to come.' National Rail has warned of major disruption on the railways until the end of the day due to both flooding on the railways and the weather displacing train crews - meaning some services have been unable to run at all. Police closed down King's Cross Station yesterday due to overcrowding, as rail bosses begged passengers to use different terminals amidst the chaos. Temporary crowd control measures were instated by police before eventually being lifted at around 5pm - even as operators advised passengers not to travel. Passenger John Hinson, who has Parkinson's disease, said he felt safer holidaying in Jordan - which lies between Syria and Israel - for the last two weeks than he did arriving at the London terminal. He told PA: 'It was just so dangerous. I have Parkinson's and I have difficulty walking, so my wife went to ask for assistance and all assistance was cancelled.

Hundreds of schools closed in the first strike by members of the National Education Union on February 1. Councils admit the full picture of school closures will not be known until the day of the strike but have begun to publish lists. Parents are being advised to contact their child's school and check media and schools' social media for the latest up-to-date information Union members initially suspended further strikes while talks continued with the Welsh Government but then rejected a new pay offer from education minister Jeremy Miles and will now strike again on March 2. Two further strike days are planned for March 15 and 16. Read more: Wales faces massive shortage of specialist physics and chemistry teachers The renewed offer would have given teachers a further 1.5 pay rise plus a one-off cash bonus also equivalent to 1.5 of a teacher's salary in addition to the initial 5 pay offer. Union members said that was just not good enough and you can read more details of that here. Some local education authorities have published lists of schools they know will shut when teachers walk out on Thursday, March 2, but have conceded there may be more and those lists are likely to change. Councils said they will not know until the day of the strike which schools will be running normally or not. Staff do not have to tell head teachers if they plan to walk out so the full situation will not be clear until then. A work to rule by school leaders, who have also rejected the new offer on grounds it does not address working conditions, means heads will not provide cover for striking teachers. Online learning will not be provided Cllr Phil Wynn, lead member for education at Wrexham Council, summed up the situation across Wales and said: We understand parents' concerns as there will inevitably be disruption on Thursday, March 2, and we are working with schools to manage this in the best way possible. The full extent of the industrial action, however, will not be known until the day itself. Members of the NEU will take their protest to the Senedd on March 2 with a strike day rally from 11.45am. Joint general secretary Mary Bousted will speak at the rally expected to be attended by hundreds of striking teachers. The strike coincides with teacher strikes in England and head teachers and school leaders who are members of the National Association of Headteachers Cymru have also rejected the latest offer. Members of the NAHT Cymru said the renewed pay offer from the Welsh Government was too vague and did not address their concerns over workload. The heads' work to rule means tasks they will not do include providing cover for striking teachers or information on who is striking. They will also restrict their availability to receive or respond to calls and emails before 9am or after 3pm.

As a local education authority we have met with the heads of the county's primary, secondary, and special schools in order to prepare and discuss the main issues that may arise. The impact of the strike will vary from school to school. We sympathise with the concern this may cause for pupils and their families and we are working closely with our schools so that they can provide appropriate and consistent information to parents and pupils in advance. The full extent of the industrial action cannot be known until the day itself. As a council we are committed to working with the Welsh Government and the unions to resolve this dispute and to ensure that any action disrupts as little as possible on the provision of education in the county. Wrexham Cllr Phil Wynn, lead member for education, said: We understand parents' concerns as there will inevitably be disruption on Thursday, March 2, and we are working with schools to manage this in the best way possible. The full extent of the industrial action, however, will not be known until the day itself. Head teachers are preparing risk assessments based on the information they have in order to assist them in making a decision on whether or not to close, partially close, or remain open. They will endeavour to give as much notice as possible to parents. Parents are advised to look out for communications from their child's school and to take the necessary action. Anglesey A council spokesman said: We are liaising with head teachers to assess how the latest industrial action will affect our schools on March 2. Assessing the impact of the industrial action is, of course, hampered by the fact that teachers do not have to inform their head teacher that they are unavailable for work until the morning of March 2. However we will continue to work with schools to ensure that we have as clear a picture as possible. Schools will be informing parents directly with regards to their intention as soon as they are able to. Flintshire A council spokesman said: The full extent of the industrial action will not be known until the day itself. We advise parents to look out for communications from their child's school directly and to take the necessary action. Elsewhere Wales' two largest local education authorities, Cardiff and Swansea, said they could not give any details of school closures until nearer the time. In the last strike most schools in both cities shut. NEU members said they are striking to save education which faces a teacher recruitment and retainment crisis after years of pay erosion and increased workload. Teachers are leaving the profession for better-paid jobs, the union said. Schools across Wales have reported difficulty recruiting in core subjects such as maths and English as well as the sciences. NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: The offer of an additional 1.5 added to teachers pay, plus an additional 1.5 lump-sum, is simply not good enough and fails to address either the cost of living crisis, spiralling inflation, nor the damage done to pay since 2010. We have a clear mandate for strike action that is now rescheduled for March 2 in schools across Wales. Nasuwt Cymru has also now rejected the new pay offer with that union warning it is committed to a further industrial action ballot of members in Wales unless there is an improved offer. A ballot of members after the first pay offer of 5 did not get enough votes across the threshold for a strike at that time.

483,02:53.0,7484807959,weather_naturalevent,aaa6ce5a-8bb0-4f71-a446-4ea68bf40bcf,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/tornado-season-2023-strong-start-rcna78394,478 tornado reports across 25 states: How a mild winter led to destruction,"A string of destructive tornadoes ripped through huge swaths of the country in recent weeks, with experts saying a warmer-than-usual winter across the South likely fueled what has been one of the busiest recorded starts to the tornado season. There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Only 2017, with 503 tornado reports, and 2008, with 523, had more at this point in the year. Pinning down how tornado activity will change in a warming world -- if at all -- is an active area of research, and more data is needed. But a picture is emerging of how risks are changing across parts of the country, particularly in areas where social factors compound vulnerabilities to extreme weather. This year's active start can be blamed, at least in part, on the mild winter conditions experienced across much of the country, said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Severe Storms Laboratory. Warmer-than-usual winters create the type of atmospheric instability in early spring that is a key ingredient for severe storms, including those that spin up tornadoes. If you do not get the cold fronts across the Gulf, all you need is a little bit of wind to bring in a lot of warm, moist air, Brooks said. And this has been a year where cold fronts really have not gotten that far south. The southern part of the YOU.S. was not particularly cold this winter. This dynamic is why tornadoes in the South occur more commonly in the cooler months, from late fall through winter and into early spring. It is also why this part of the country may become more vulnerable as the world warms. A study published last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that supercell storms, which can produce violent tornadoes, will increase as the world warms. These storms are also projected to hit Southern states like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee more frequently in the future, according to the research.",0,,,"There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday. Only 2017 and 2008 had more at this point in the year. Warmer-than-usual winters create the type of atmospheric instability in early spring.

According to the McCown report, which covers the top ten US container ports, import throughput last month fell a record 28, to 1,454,438 teu, the lowest level since March 2020, as extremely weak demand was exacerbated by the Chinese New Year falling ten days earlier than last year. Meanwhile, imports at US east and Gulf coast ports declined 18.7, to 809,375 teu, with only the port of Houston recording an increase, 12.7 year on year, to 141,946 teu. The west coast ports were also impacted by the continued coastal shift to the east and the unresolved west coast labour situation. The port of Los Angeles saw a startling 41.2 collapse in container imports, to 249,407 teu, demoting it to third in the import rankings behind New YorkNew Jersey, with 280,652 teu, and San Pedro Bay neighbour Long Beach's 254,970 teu. During a cargo news briefing on Friday, LA's executive director, Gene Seroka, said vessel calls in February were down to 61, compared with 93 in the same month of last year, and no fewer than 30 blanked sailings in the month. The demand is just not there, he said. US warehouses remain largely full, retailers must clear inventory levels before the next wave of imports arrive, but with the economy on everybody's mind and consumers continuing to feel the pinch of inflation, older inventories are simply not moving fast enough. All this, he added, amid reports in the US media of retailers deciding to destroy stock they could not shift even with heavy discounting. Mr Seroka said that while he expected March volumes to be better, throughput would be around a third down, quarter on quarter, and would remain lighter than average in the first half of 2023. Indeed, McCown report three-month data is now showing a 21 decline in import volumes, a further decrease on the 17.2 negative of last month. And there was further evidence of the global slowdown in the big drop in empty equipment being shipped back to Asia, with the port of Los Angeles processing 156,035 teu for export during the month, versus 338,251 teu the previous year. Nevertheless, Mr Seroka said, there was some reason for optimism from its close monitoring of purchase orders - which he explained typically convert to shipments from Asia 90 to 100 days later. We are starting to see a little bit of an uptick in the middle of the year, he said. Meanwhile, US exports continued their recent gains, recording an overall 4.6 increase to 789,037 teu in February, for a trailing three-month gain of 8.7. According to the McCown report, the ports with the strongest export performance in February were Houston, up 41.7 to 116,265 teu, Charleston, up 12.2 to 61,448 teu, and Norfolk, up 8.8 to 96,399 teu. Los Angeles was the weakest, with a loss of 13.7, to 82,404 teu, followed by Oakland, with a drop of 9.4, to 56,475 teu.",0,,,"US container imports in February were massively down from the highs of the previous year.

Judge John Hughes adjourned the case for the directions of the DPP to be given. Mr Guzauskas, of Ridgewood Close, Swords, Co Dublin, is charged with one offence under Section 43 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988. He is accused of knowingly causing a false alarm by flying an unmanned aerial system (drone) into the critical area of Dublin Airport which interfered with the operation of an aerodrome. The offence is alleged to have happened at Naul Road on July 2, 2022. Garda Paul Murphy told Judge Hughes he arrested the accused at Dublin Airport garda station at 2.57pm today for the purpose of charge. He was charged at 4.08pm and made no reply after caution. The accused was handed a copy of the charge sheet, the garda said. He had no objection to bail subject to conditions. Asked how far Mr Guzauskas lived from the airport, the garda said it was 2km as the crow flies but further to drive. The judge also asked if the accused had any upcoming reason to be near the airport. Defence solicitor Donal Quigley said his client would be flying from the airport for a holiday in July. Judge Hughes granted bail in the accused's own bond of 500, with no cash lodgement or surety required. Under conditions, Mr Guzauskas is prohibited from owning or flying a drone at any time, for any reason anywhere within the state, and is not to take part in any way in the operation of a drone. He must not attend within 2km of Dublin Airport without the consent of the garda. He is to reside at the address on the charge sheet and notify gardai of any proposed change of address. Mr Guzauskas must submit a phone number at which he is contactable 24 hours per day. He is also to surrender passport within 24 hours, undertake not to apply for any other travel documents and not leave the state without permission. The judge granted free legal aid after hearing the accused was a separated father-of-two and worked for a removal company. Gda Murphy said the DPP had given preliminary directions to charge Mr Guzauskas and sought an adjournment for an investigation file to be sent. The case was adjourned to March 21. Mr Guzauskas has not yet indicated how he intends to plead to the charge. The accused is the second person to appear before the court in recent weeks on a charge related to drone-flying near the airport. Earlier this month, Eric Brills (50) of Holywell Dale, Swords, was charged with flying a drone in a critical area close to Dublin Airport, which was likely to interfere with the safety of aircraft in flight. Mr Brills' charge was under Section 3 of the same Act and followed an incident on January 24 this year.

So far, the fire is believed contained in the aft end of the vessel not reaching its cargo of jet fuel and diesel and there has not been an oil leak. However, the fire is continuing to burn with spectators along the shoreline posting photos of the burning ship which is less than two miles from the coast. The tanker Greta K (24,768 dwt) was inbound for the port of Leixes, having already boarded her pilot when the fire was reported around 3:30 p.m. Marinha Portuguesa is monitoring the situation reporting that Port Authority was able to quickly send three tugboats to the vessel. In addition, the Port Captain for Douro and Leixes sent two additional tugboats to assist. They have evacuated 12 of the 19 Filipino crewmembers aboard the vessel. The other seven have remained aboard to assist in the firefight. Local media is reporting that the fire was contained at the stern and suspected to have started in the engine room. Black smoke is seen billowing from the stern. The fireboats are spraying water on the aft sections of the ship while others were assigned to cool the tops of the cargo tanks.

At least 900,000 barrels per day (BBLd) of France's 1.15 million BBLd refinery capacity is offline due to strike action. This has a supporting impact on refined product prices and a weakening impact on regional crude prices, said Hillary Stevenson, Senior Director, Energy Market Intelligence for Industrial Info. Operations at all but one of the six operational oil refineries in France have been impacted by the strikes. TotalEnergies SE's (NYSE:TTE) (Courbevoie, France) 119,000-BBLd Feyzin Refinery was running at half capacity. Previously, the European Union's embargo on Russian oil products went into effect on February 5. Ahead of the sanctions, European gasoil (diesel) stocks increased in preparation for the shutoff of Russian supplies, hitting a 15-month high at the beginning of the year, according to consultancy Insights Global (Breda, Netherlands). Gasoil stocks declined last week, according to the consultancy, but stocks remained higher year on year, as Europe is going through stocks built up before 5 February. The French strikes remain a going concern for the market's supply... Strikes at French refineries have cut deeply into France's refined products output, including gasoil. The strikes were staged in protest to an increase in the retirement age in France. Stevenson said Exxon Mobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) (Irving, Texas) 191,000-BBLd Esso Refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, is undergoing a plantwide turnaround outage until mid-May, thus exacerbating the fuel situation in Europe. While the prices of other oil-based commodities have declined in recent days due to banking-related market woes, the price of gasoil has remained stable, Stevenson noted.

When Britain opted to leave the EU customs union, French officials began thoroughly checking the passports of British travelers, much as they would check the documents of any foreign nationals arriving from third countries. That manual process has had an impact on the throughput rate for cross-channel passenger transport, according to the Port of Dover, contributing to delays during surges in travel activity. This occurred over the weekend as thousands of Britons headed to Europe by bus and ferry for their spring break vacations. The Port of Dover declared a state of emergency when a combination of bad weather, higher-than-expected traffic volume and customs delays on the French side led to some passenger buses experiencing a wait of up to 18 hours. Port officials at Dover cited lengthy French border processes and sheer volume for the delays. In an interview on Sky News on Sunday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman played down the disruption as a weather event. I do not think it is fair to say that this is an adverse effect of Brexit . . . We have had many years now since leaving the EU, and there is been, on the whole, very good operations and processes at the border, she said. Braverman was a leading proponent of the Brexit Leave campaign in the run-up to the referendum in 2016, and continued to run on delivering Brexit opportunities in the Tories' leadership contest last year. On Monday, a spokesman for the administration of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak allowed that passport controls played a role in the delay. We recognize there are new processes in place - that is why authorities were given a long time to prepare for the new checks, the spokesman said. And we are in discussion with our French counterparts about how we can further improve the flow of traffic. Another pro-Brexit leader, former Brexit transition negotiator Lord Frost, admitted in a statement Monday that since Brexit the processes have got a bit more laborious. If we want to control movement into the UK . . . then we must expect the EU to control movement into the EU. We cannot have it both ways and we should be honest about that, he said. This coming November, France will also institute fingerprint and biometric scans for arriving UK nationals, the same protocol it plans to apply to other citizens of third countries. This is expected to add further to processing times for inbound travelers from Britain.",1,,,"Port officials at Dover cited lengthy French border processes and sheer volume for the delays.

They were killed when a passenger train, on route from Athens to Thessaloniki with more than 350 people on board -- many of them young students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent -- crashed head-on into a freight train shortly before midnight Tuesday, outside the town of Tempe in central Greece. According to a report on Thursday by public broadcaster ERT, 52 people remain in hospital in Larissa as a result of the crash. Six people are in critical condition due to head wounds and serious burns. Residents in Larissa lined up to give blood, many waiting more than an hour in heavy rain. The rescue and recovery operation is ongoing amid the completely destroyed and crushed rail carriages. Rescuer Konstantinos Imanimidis told Reuters on Thursday, It will be very difficult to find survivors, due to the temperatures caused by fires that developed in the carriages... This is the hardest thing, instead of saving lives we have to dig out bodies. On Wednesday, the government announced three days of national mourning, while asserting that the disaster was, according to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, mainly due to a tragic human error. The station master in Larissa, a worker with over 40 years' experience on the railways, has been arrested. But the attempt to pin the blame on a single individual has been widely rejected, fuelling protests and a rail strike against the New Democracy (ND) conservative government. Workers know that the rail network has suffered years of austerity cuts, including mass job losses. Much of the network, especially in northern Greece, is not automated, relying on manual signalling. The station master was charged Thursday with dangerous disruptions of transportation, and may face charges of manslaughter through negligence, bodily harm through negligence and dangerous interventions in means of transportation. But evidence is already emerging throwing doubt over claims that human error is to blame. Kathimerini reported that when the station master appeared before an investigative magistrate in the town of Larissa Thursday, He allegedly claimed that during his shift he gave an order to change the tracks on the railway network so that the two trains would not move on the same line but that the system apparently did not respond. The newspaper added, This version of events is supported by a photograph from the stationmaster's logbook that shows he instructed the fatal Inter City 62 train to continue its journey to Neos Poros, apparently not knowing that the freight train was moving on the same piece of track right toward it. More evidence points to the catastrophic implications of having sections of the rail system that rely totally on manual intervention, with no implementation of automated rail systems widely used internationally. Kathimerini noted, A colleague reportedly said in an interview with the media that before the fatal accident another train had come to a standstill at Tempe. And that in order to move the stalled train to the nearest station there were changes to the tracks, but the network was not later restored to its previous state. The deaths prompted angry protests in Athens, in Thessaloniki where many of the people who died lived, and in Larissa near to where to crash occurred. In Athens, hundreds of mainly young protesters demonstrated on Wednesday outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train, the privatised company responsible for maintaining Greek railways. They were attacked by riot police, who fired tear gas and stun grenades. Protesters then marched to the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square where police attacked again. In Larissa, a silent vigil to commemorate the victims of the crash was held. Speaking to the AFP news agency, Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, said, The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff. The arrested station master should not pay the price for a whole ailing system. Larissa-based doctor Costas Bargiotas said, This is an inadmissible accident. We have known this situation for 30 years. The BBC reported, Families have given DNA samples to help identification efforts, with the results expected on Thursday. One of those, a woman called Katerina searching for her missing brother, a passenger on the train, shouted 'Murderers!' outside the hospital in Larissa, directing her anger towards the government and the rail company. On Thursday, rail workers in the Federation of Railway Employees began a nationwide 24-hour strike to protest the deaths and the unsafe conditions on Greece's rail network. A statement by the union said, Pain has turned into anger for the dozens of dead and wounded colleagues and fellow citizens. Successive governments, it added, had ignored repeated demands to improve safety standards. The rail network required hiring permanent personnel, better training and, above all, modern safety technology. These proposals had always ended up in the trash can. Lines 2 and 3 of the Athens Metro were also suspended for the duration of the rail workers' action due to a solidarity strike by members of the Athens Metro Workers Union. That evening, striking workers protested outside Hellenic Railway headquarters in Athens, with thousands then marching to Syntagma Square, with young people joining them -- to protest in front of the parliament. The train deaths are the result of social crimes for which every political party of the ruling elite shares responsibility. It is their leaders who should be in the dock facing charges. Under-resourcing and destaffing of an already below standard rail network was acceleratedover the last decade with the privatisation of the state-own railway, TrainOSE, by the pseudo-left SYRIZA government in 2017-18. SYRIZA was brought to power in 2015 on a wave of protests and strikes after five years of savage austerity. They then trampled on this mandate, imposing, as ND and the social democratic PASOK did before them, a devastating austerity programme. The privatisation of key national economic assets and infrastructure was the price demanded in return for any further loans by the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund. SYRIZA carried their instructions out to the letter. TrainOSE was sold off as part of the third austerity package imposed after 2010, with the rail privatisation and sale of other state assets expected to raise 6 billion euros by 2018. It was bought by Ferrovie Dello Stato Italian, the Italian state-owned railway holding company, for just 45 million. SYRIZA's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, at a lavish ceremony in Corfu, presented this as a glorious success. Naftemporiki, the daily financial newspaper, reported, Tsipras explained that the importance of the investment lies in the fact that the country has been spared a great financial burden... in the price itself, but even more so in the size of the investment it will make in the Greek economy, in the Greek railway, amounting to 500 million euros. Tsipras's lies were soon exposed, with the newly privatised firm, renamed Hellenic Railways, making no investments to upgrade the rail network. The reality, as SYRIZA knew well, was that Ferrovie Dello Stato Italian was planning only vast profits. Ferrovie's CEO Renato Mazzoncini described buying TrainOSE as a strategic move for the group. It is not so much about buying a piece of Greece at reduced price, but rather about a strategic expansion operation in view of the major investment in the Athens-Thessaloniki line, which is part of the European corridor project. The European corridor project would be worth about 3 billion, said Mazzoncini. The horrific human cost was confirmed in an EU report last year on Railway Safety and Interoperability in the EU. Greece was the only member state entirely without train protection systems that are widely considered one of the most effective railway safety measures for reducing the risk of collisions between trains. Post-privatization, Greece's rail network is one of the most dangerous in Europe. From 2018 to 2020, according to the European Union Agency for Railways, Greece recorded the highest railway fatality rate per million train kilometres among 28 European nations. On Thursday, the Financial Times reported, Fifteen days before the worst railway crash Greece has seen in decades, the European Commission had referred the country to the European Court of Justice for 'failing to fulfil its obligations' from 2015 to the present day under the Single European Railway Area Directive regarding infrastructure investments and emergency procedures.

Scientists explain how warming climate affects tornado activity,"The mid-South is at a 25 greater risk of tornado threats, an expert said. As the earth's temperature climbs, so does the threat of extreme weather events such as drought, wildfire, hurricanes and tornadoes -- all occurring more frequently at higher strengths, according to climate scientists. More violent and widespread tornado activity -- like the line of severe storms in recent days that killed dozens of people -- is expected in the future as global warming persists, experts told ABC News. At the start of the weekend, a powerful storm system unleashed a line of violent tornadoes across 14 states. At least nine EF3 tornadoes -- wind speeds ranging from 136 to 165 mph -- were confirmed to have touched down in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Delaware on Friday and Saturday. While such events have occurred in the past, the evidence points to climate change contributing to the frequency and magnitude of tornado behavior, Walker Ashley, an atmospheric scientist and disaster geographer at Northern Illinois University, told ABC News. This is a representation of what we might perhaps expect to happen in a particularly active tornado season as we move forward in a warming climate regime, said Jana Houser, associate professor of meteorology at Ohio State University, of the recent deadly tornado activity. Simulations of the atmosphere indicate that, as global temperatures continue to rise, so do the chances that the fundamental ingredients for a severe thunderstorm will be present, Ashley said. With more moisture, atmospheric instability -- the gasoline for storms -- and wind shear, the unique dynamical force that allows the twister to become organized -- strong storms, hail and tornadoes are more likely, Ashley said. Outbreaks just happen to occur with a lot more of these ingredients coming together, he said. Not only do the fundamental ingredients exist at a higher rate, but they are also occurring across large areas, Ashley said. While severe weather has always existed, climate change appears to be the because of the greater magnitude of impacts when it comes to severe storms, Walker said. The geographic location with the most frequent tornado activity tends to change year over year, Houser told ABC News. One year the Southeast may get slammed with tornadoes, while another year the activity could be concentrated further west, she added. Overall, the research indicates that an environment supportive of the formation of tornadoes is expanding in the southeast, the experts said. A 2018 study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Northern Illinois University found that tornadoes are slightly declining in the Great Plains and increasing in the east. Recent simulations indicate that the area that produces the most significant tornadoes will be east of Interstate 35 -- including the mid-South, the Ozark plateau and the lower Ohio Valley, Ashley said. The areas west of I-35, Oklahoma, Kansas, the Dakotas, eastern Colorado and west Texas, will slightly decline, Ashley said, adding that those who live in the mid-South are at 25 greater risk of tornado threats. It is not so much that Tornado Alley will no longer apply to a large swath of the Central YOU.S., but that other regions are beginning to catch up to the tornado production rates that are more typical of the Central Plains, Houser said. If the frequency of tornadoes were measured purely by touchdown points, the Great Plains would easily clock in the most in the world, Ashley said. But tornadoes are typically measured by landscapes and how much damage they because. Another factor driving the because of increased impacts from tornadoes is the expanding bullseye effect, in which rural communities between the large cities in the south -- Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville -- have rapidly increased in population over the past 50 years, Ashley said. In past decades when a tornado formed in those areas, it may not have hit anything. The odds of something being hit by one of these events is going up substantially, Ashley said. It is projected to continue to increase, just because people continue to build out. It is just the natural occurrence of development in the United States. An unusual aspect of the recent tornado activity is how far north lines of twisters are forming -- especially in what is traditionally a cooler season, Houser said. It is not common to see tornadoes in places like Iowa, Illinois and New Jersey in this time of year, she added. American Meteorological Society expects that with the changing climate tornado season will escalate outside of the traditional peak season, which is March through May, according to a study published earlier this year. Meteorologists can predict favorable tornado conditions further out than ever before -- up to 10 days in some cases -- which is quite the mathematical feat, Ashley said. It is remarkable that we have been able to take what is a fluid atmosphere, which interfaces with a rotating planet, and take mathematical equations, and plug them into a model, Ashley said. But, they will probably never get to the point where they can predict with certainty when a tornado will form, namely because scientists do not really have all of the full complete picture of what makes a storm produce a tornado, Houser said. It is incredibly difficult to pinpoint when and where a specific ongoing storm is going to make a tornado -- even a couple of hours before, Houser said. A herculean effort would involve a plentitude of weather balloons and the ability to locate an atmospheric needle in a haystack -- a relatively small scale phenomena, she added. And because they are so small-scale, tornadoes are incredibly sensitive to small nuances in environmental conditions. You are dealing with something that is only, in many cases, tens of yards wide, at most, two and a half miles wide, Ashley said. That is tiny, compared to the entire global atmospheric system. In order to survive a tornado, the best thing to do is to be inside a sturdy structure, in the basement or an interior bathroom or closet, the experts said. The worst place to be is somewhere fully exposed, where flying debris can hit and kill you, or in a manufactured or mobile home. These houses are just not built to withstand even minimally strong tornadic winds, Ashley said. The leading because of death in a tornado is blunt force trauma, Houser said -- so appropriate attire, such as hard-soled shoes and bicycle helmets, is essential for survival in some cases. The truth is that if you prepare and do the right thing, your chances survivability is almost 100, Ashley said. Now if you do not do the right thing, you can certainly increase your odds of death and injury substantially, though.",0,,,"The mid-South is at a 25 greater risk of tornado threats, an expert says.

According to officials, crews are currently accessing interior spaces to extinguish hot spots and look for standing water. In the coming days, responders will ensure that the vessel is safe for investigators to board and for salvage work to proceed, including the removal of the reported 55,000 gallons of diesel onboard. The Coast Guard and NTSB will conduct an investigation into the because of the fire. The fire on the Kodiak Enterprise started early Saturday morning as the vessel was docked at Trident Seafoods in the Hylebos Waterway in Tacoma, Washington. The fire appears to have started in the forward portion of the 276-foot ship and later spread through entirety of the vessel, prompting fears of damage to the vessel's freon tanks. Although the smoke coming from the vessel has decreased, air monitoring has continued as a precaution. Particulate levels at the incident site and in nearby neighborhoods have not shown levels of concern. Dewatering operations are ongoing in order to improve stability as firefighters continue to apply water to the outside of the vessel to cool the hull. The vessel is currently surrounded by three layers of containment boom, and responders and equipment are staged and ready to respond if pollution is observed in the waterway. Vessels can request to transit the safety zone established on the Hylebos Waterway, and commercial traffic should contact Seattle Traffic on VHF-14.

Falling trees have killed two people in California as storms, damaging winds, rain and snowfall continue to batter the western US state. High-wind warnings and advisories were in effect from the Mexico border through Los Angeles and up into the San Francisco Bay area, where gusts of up to 97 kilometres per hour (60 mph) were forecast for some spots. Much of the region along with parts of Arizona and Nevada were under flood watches and advisories on Wednesday caused by the continued rain and snow melt, the US National Weather Service said. Our rivers, streams and creeks are flowing at near capacity. Any more rain that we get today is only going to cause more flooding or worsen the flooding that is ongoing, said Bill South, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Hanford, California. In Northern California's Bay Area community of Portola Valley, a man driving a sewer truck was killed when a tree fell onto his vehicle on Tuesday, the California Highway Patrol said. Fire officials in neighbouring Contra Costa County also said a large tree killed the passenger and injured the driver of a passing car. Mountain snow that forecasters said will be measured in feet fell on the central and southern parts of the state, as intense hail was reported in Sacramento, the state capital in the north. Trees and power lines were reported downed in the San Francisco Bay Area. More than 118,000 customers in California were without power by Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.US, a website that tracks utility outages. An Amtrak commuter train carrying 55 passengers struck a downed tree and derailed near the East Bay village of Porta Costa on Tuesday. The train remained upright and nobody was injured, Amtrak and fire officials said. Wind gusts reached 122 kmh (76 mph) - a level classified as hurricane force by the National Weather Service - in Santa Cruz mountain communities, including Boulder Creek. Resident Frank Kuhr waited for hours on Tuesday afternoon at a downtown supermarket for crews to remove large trees that were blocking a highway. Trees are down everywhere, Kuhr told The Associated Press news agency. The wind has been unbelievable. Branches were flying through the air, and folks could hear trees just falling and cracking. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said on Tuesday that it had 22 sites available across 12 counties to provide impacted Californians with shelters and other resources. The office said it was proactively coordinating the prepositioning of flood fighting personnel to be available if needed. The National Weather Service said the storm is a Pacific low pressure system interacting with California's 12th atmospheric river since late December. The latest storm follows months of intense weather in California that saw flooding ravage the state. California's persisting wet weather this winter, which included atmospheric rivers and February blizzards powered by arctic air, comes after years of droughts and wildfires.

All dates for March and April, and the services affected","Bid to end train strikes fails as union refuses to put 'best and final' 9pc pay rise offer to members Commuters are facing fresh travel chaos over Easter after rail workers voted to stage further strikes over next month and April amid an ongoing row over pay. Union leader Mick Lynch said workers will be taking sustained and targeted industrial action over the next few months, after blaming the Government for failing to allow train companies to make new, better offers. Mr Lynch, who heads up the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT), said: The Government can settle this dispute easily by unshackling the rail companies. However, its stubborn refusal to do so will now mean more strike action across the railway network and a very disruptive overtime ban. It comes days after the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT) rejected train operators' best and final 9pc pay rise. Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, had last week signalled he was not willing to allow train operators to sweeten their deal with better terms on pay. It dashed hopes that the RMT was nearing pay deals from both train operators and Network Rail. The Telegraph recently revealed that Mr Lynch had been facing pressure from members to avoid further strike action. What are the new train strike dates? The RMT announced this afternoon that rail workers at 14 train operators are due to stage four days of walkouts: Thursday March 16Saturday March 18 Monday March 20Saturday April 1 National Rail staff are also planning to strike on March 16. The RMT says it represents around 40,000 workers across National Rail and the 14 train operators, meaning major swathes of the train network will grind to a halt. Disruption is also expected to come from a planned overtime ban by National Rail workers who are members of the RMT. Which train companies will be affected? There are 14 train companies which will be affected by the staff walkouts, and it is expected that these will be the same ones which have been hit by earlier walkouts. These are: Chiltern Railways Cross Country Trains Greater Anglia, LNER, East Midlands Railway, c2c, Great Western Railway, Northern Trains, South Eastern South Western Railway Transpennine Express, Avanti West Coast, West Midlands Trains GTR (including Gatwick Express) Why are rail workers going on strike? Unions are demanding pay rises for their members who are battling soaring inflation, although train operators are limited in how much they can offer, given they require a mandate from the Government. Train bosses are also under pressure to cut costs to balance the books, after a slump in the number of people commuting into city centres every day. This means they are looking at introducing more technology. Union bosses have said they cannot accept so-called modernisation efforts, as it would result in a severe reduction in scheduled maintenance tasks, making the railways less safe, the closure of all ticket offices and thousands of jobs stripped out of the industry when the railways need more investment not less. Will I be able to get a refund if my train is going to be cancelled? In previous strikes, National Rail has said that, if a train journey is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled, passengers are entitled to a change or refund from wherever they bought their tickets. Customers with season tickets have also been able to claim compensation through the delay repay scheme, while National Rail has said that weekly season tickets which have not started yet can be refunded, although a 10 admin fee may apply.",1,,,"Rail workers at 14 train operators are due to stage four days of walkouts.

Thirty-eight cars derailed on a train traveling from Madison, Illinois to Conway, Pennsylvania. Some of the cars that derailed were carrying vinyl chloride, a volatile carcinogen. Faced with the possibility of an uncontrolled explosion, shrapnel from exploding cars, and seepage of chemicals into the water, the governor, Mike DeWine, authorized a controlled burn. The resulting conflagration was visible many miles away. Both the liquid and the solid contaminated waste will stay in Ohio and be treated at various sites. Environmental officials said that air quality in East Palestine was normal. Yet, people continue to report respiratory problems and a general feeling of malaise. The EPA is continuing to provide updates concerning home re-entry screenings and air quality from 15 stations around the town. Many people live near rail lines, including here in St. Cloud. Many lines sweep through pretty countryside with rivers and fields. The damage done to the land around East Palestine is difficult. But even more tragic is the possibility that cancer rates will increase in the town in the future. Rivers in the area may be contaminated for years, with fish unable to live in the polluted water. There are many people now pointing fingers. The workers on many railways were recently stopped by law from striking. They point to longer hours and longer trains, less staff and less safety, as the rail companies try to squeeze more profits out of the system. The time required to inspect a rail car was halved recently to 90 seconds. While making efforts to compensate the town's citizens for having to temporarily vacate their homes, there has been criticism of the company's willingness to talk with them about their response. Not a single executive from Norfolk Southern showed up. Politicians have taken turns using the town as a platform for expressing their views and criticizing their opponents. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is promoting rail reform. Some of his proposals have found favor with rail union advocates. One such idea would be a new rule requiring at least 2 conductors on every train. This would make goods that travel by rail more expensive, of course, and squeeze rail company profits. Some of that would eventually pass back to farmers in higher costs of sending their goods to market. Governor Mike DeWine, meanwhile, has not requested federal help with the cleanup, insisting instead that Norfolk Southern tear up all the track at the crash site and decontaminate the land underneath. Even though the company is paying local residents, both he and nearby Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro are threatening lawsuits. The EPA is imposing other costs on the company. OSHA has taken over the investigation. Mechanical failure (a faulty bearing) is believed to have caused the explosion of several cars. Rather than seeing who can blame the company the most, I worry about the next possible accident. We were influenced the last couple of years by supply chain issues, which railways (along with ports and truckers) were asked to solve. As a result these companies, including Norfolk Southern, saw substantial increases in revenues and profits. Pressure to unsnarl supply chains may have caused the firm to cut corners and keep workers working longer hours and not necessarily firing poorly performing workers. Such pressures may have caused us to ignore railroad workers' concerns. It is clearly time to have them heard now and address the problems that have cropped up. After two years of such extraordinary pressure on transportation systems, can we be sure another accident will not happen? This is the opinion of Times Writers Group member Barbara Banaian, a professional pianist who lives in the St. Cloud area. Her column is published the first Sunday of the month.",1,,,"On February 3, a railroad accident took place in the town of East Palestine, Ohio. Some of the cars that derailed were carrying vinyl chloride, a volatile carcinogen. Faced with the possibility of an uncontrolled explosion, shrapnel from exploding cars, and seepage of chemicals into the water, the governor authorized a controlled burn. Rivers in the area may be contaminated for years, with fish unable to live in the polluted water. There are many people now pointing fingers at rail companies."

But no imminent work action can happen because the federally controlled negotiating process still has a long way to go. The Air Line Pilots Association said voting for strike authorization will begin Tuesday. Getting rank-and-file permission to call a strike is a common union tactic that typically gives its bargainers more clout at the negotiating table. The pilots are frustrated by what they perceive as slow progress over two years. The FedEx (NYSE: FDX) pilots' contract became eligible for changes in November 2021, although talks began six months earlier. Management and the union have been bargaining through the auspices of the National Mediation Board for the past seven months after direct negotiations failed to produce an agreement. Officials say they have resolved retirement and quality-of-life issues but are still at odds over pay levels. At a time when our pilots should be joining our company in celebration of its 50th anniversary, we are instead forced to apply additional pressure to management in an effort to secure a new contract, said Capt. Chris Norman, chair of the FedEx Master Executive Council. We do not make a decision like this lightly, but we intend to send a strong and unified message to management that our pilots are willing to go the distance to achieve the contract we have earned. Under federal rules designed to prevent work interruptions in critical interstate commerce, workers are prohibited from striking and companies from locking out workers until a lengthy series of bargaining steps, including federal mediation, are completed. The federal mediator has the power to hold the parties in mediation indefinitely. The negotiation process can take more than a year at this stage. If no progress is made, the National Mediation Board (NMB) at some point may release the union to a 30-day cooling-off period during which negotiations can still take place but no strike or lockout can occur. If the NMB determines the parties have reached an impasse it can propose that the remaining issues be sent to a special panel for binding arbitration. Arbitration in the airline industry is rare because both sides must agree to it. The law allows the president to create an emergency board to investigate a labor dispute and issue a report within 30 days if the parties reject binding arbitration. That is followed by another 30-day period to consider the board's recommendations and reach an agreement. If no agreement is reached at the end of the cooling-off period, the parties may take action, such as a strike or lockout. FedEx remains focused on reaching a comprehensive agreement. With that in mind, we remain committed to bargaining in good faith with our pilots to achieve an agreement that is fair to them, our other team members, and all other FedEx stakeholders, the company said in a statement. ALPA's call for a vote of its members has no impact on our service as we continue delivering for our customers around the world. Several factors are influencing each party's bargaining position and relative power. Amid the COVID crisis and supply chain disruptions two years ago, e-commerce and air cargo were in extremely high demand and all-cargo operators enjoyed unrivaled profits. But e-commerce and international growth cooled off significantly last year. The softness in volume combined with an underutilized infrastructure network contributed to significant declines in operating income in the fiscal year first quarter and stirred management to implement a 6 billion cost-cutting and restructuring campaign. That includes parking aircraft, flying fewer flights and outsourcing more airlift to third parties. And there is always the prospect of federal intervention that could prevent the union from getting everything it seeks through collective bargaining. In December, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring all freight rail unions to ratify the labor agreement that union and railroad negotiators had reached in September. UPS pilots last year ratified a two-year contract extension.

(AP) -- A major industrial fire fueled by tons of scrap plastics in an Indiana city has been fully extinguished, although an evacuation order for people living nearby remains in place, the city's mayor said. Richmond Mayor Dave Snow tweeted Thursday night that the fire chief of the eastern Indiana city had informed him that the fire has been fully extinguished ahead of schedule. Officials had said earlier Thursday that the fire, which began Tuesday afternoon, was close to being extinguished at the 14-acre former factory site in Richmond, a city of 35,000 about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Indianapolis, near the Ohio border. People are also reading... An evacuation order for at least 1,500 people living within a half-mile was still in effect Friday morning, but Snow said in his tweet that we are now able to turn our attention to collecting air and water samples to determine when the evacuation order can be lifted. Fire Chief Tim Brown was not available Friday morning to provide an update, another fire official said. A message seeking an update was left Friday morning for Snow, whose assistant said he was in a meeting. Clouds of black smoke marred the spring sky after the fire began Tuesday. By Thursday afternoon, the smoke was lighter and less dense after progress in dousing the fires. Brown said Thursday that the site had six buildings full of plastics floor to ceiling and wall to wall but that he expected the fires to be out by late Thursday or Friday morning. Tests on debris that landed outside the fire zone showed some evidence of asbestos, according to the YOU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which urged residents not to disturb anything they found. On Thursday, Richmond officials disclosed more details about the city's dealings with a man who was operating the business where the fire occurred. They said that Seth Smith was barred from accepting more plastics for resale following a 2020 cleanup order, but that he was allowed to keep selling a vast collection still on hand. Smith told the city in 2019 that he sends scrap materials to 29 countries, according to meeting minutes of the Unsafe Building Commission. I own a bunch of trailers, Smith told the commission. I set the semis at these facilities and they fill them up with their scrap materials. When I started in 1987, there was only 4,000 plastic companies. Now there is over 47,000 plastic companies. It has got out of control, but now I have a plan. A judge in 2020 affirmed a cleanup order after city inspectors found fire sprinklers missing and fire hazards among stacks of bulk packages of plastics. Warehouse roofs had holes and there were no utilities. Although Richmond officials apparently were trying to work with Smith, Snow said the plastics dealer was at fault for the fire. Snow said Smith told the city to speak to his attorney about the fire. The Associated Press could not reach Smith through phone listings. Ron Moore, a lawyer who has represented him, declined to comment Thursday. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

According to the report, there had been no attack on the station, nor was fire opened. Denying the possibility of a terror attack, the report stated that the station was located in the safest place and there are two security check posts in front of the police station. It added that five personnel were also present for the security of the police station. There was no report of anyone entering the police station. It is yet to be decided whether the explosions were a result of a short circuit or the result of human oversight, the report shared. The report shared that the CTD police station in Swat had a warehouse in the Malakand region. This warehouse had 300 to 400 kilogrammes of explosives which exploded due to the explosions. It further stated that two suspected terrorists who had been brought in for investigation were also killed in the blast. The explosives had also been brought from Bajaur, Dir, Swat, and Buner and also included mortar shells, IEDs, and detonators. Earlier, it had been reported there were two explosions in the station. The report on Tuesday stated that the first explosion took place at 8:20am while the second explosion took place at 8:25am. It added that the first explosion was minor, while the second explosion detonated all the explosives. Talking to Geo News, CTD DG Khalid Sohail said that the incident took place in the old office of the CTD, and most offices and people had already been relocated to a new place before the explosions. He said that only a few officers were present in the building at the time of the incident, adding that the loss of civilian lives occurred due to the outward force of the explosion. Sohail said shock waves from the explosions caused the complete collapse of the building. Among those killed, three were civilians, five were prisoners, and nine were policemen. The hospital administration said that 10 out of the 51 people injured are in critical condition. Inquiry teams are still looking into what actually caused the explosions, he said. Sources within the police said that a two-member committee had been formed to investigate the munitions blasts at the CTD police station. The body includes Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Home Secretary Abid Majeed and the Special Branch deputy inspector general. The sources said that the committee has been directed to submit a report by completing the probe as soon as possible. Following the blast, KP Police Inspector General Akhtar Hayat Gandapur said: A series of two to three bomb explosions occurred. He added that the majority of the victims were policemen.

The new cease-fire attempt came as alarm was growing that millions of Sudanese were on the brink of disaster from the past five days of warfare between the country's two most powerful generals. The fighting grew less intense in the first hours after the cease-fire took effect at 6 p.m., with sporadic clashes continuing in the city center, said Atiya Abdalla Atiya, secretary of the Doctors' Syndicate, who is still in the capital. But he said neither side has provided guarantees to his group to facilitate movement of health care workers and ambulances. Desperate residents of the capital have been running out of food and other supplies as they sheltered in their homes from the gun battles, bombardment and airstrikes on the streets outside. Hospitals have been damaged and forced to close or have been overwhelmed by wounded, with staff exhausted and medical supplies depleted. Increasingly, armed fighters have turned to looting shops and robbing anyone who dares step outside. Nearly 300 people have been killed in the past five days, the YOU.N. health agency said, but the toll is likely higher because many bodies lie uncollected in the streets. After the failure of Tuesday evening's truce attempt, hundreds gave up on trying to hold out for calm and fled their homes throughout the day Wednesday, even as explosions and gunfire shook Khartoum and the adjacent city of Omdurman. Residents of multiple neighborhoods told The Associated Press they could see men, women and children leaving with luggage, some on foot, others crowding into vehicles. On Wednesday evening, the army and its rivals, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, separately announced that a new 24-hour truce had begun. Prospects for the cease-fire were uncertain, however, as residents said they continued to hear sporadic shooting and explosions. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called for both sides to stand by a truce, renounce violence and return to negotiations. She said the army and the RSF are responsible for ensuring the protections of civilians and non combatants. Until now, army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo -- former allies against Sudan's pro-democracy movement -- seem determined to crush each other in their struggle for power. The explosion of violence between their forces, which began Saturday, has challenged international efforts to bring calm. Tuesday's cease-fire attempt failed even after YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to each general by phone and after pressure from their regional allies. Egypt, which backs the Sudanese military, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to the RSF, have been calling on all sides to stand down. Throughout the day Wednesday, the two sides battled around the main military headquarters in central Khartoum, which the RSF has tried repeatedly to capture, and the nearby airport. Residents said the military was pounding RSF positions with airstrikes. The army's monopoly on air power has appeared to give it an edge in fighting in Khartoum and Omdurman, enabling it to take several RSF bases over the past few days. But tens of thousands of fighters from the paramilitary force are fanned out across neighborhoods. Residents say armed men, mostly in RSF uniforms, have raided homes, offices and shops in neighborhoods across Khartoum. They roam in small groups from house to house, from shop to shop and loot everything, said a resident of the upscale neighborhood of Kafouri in northern Khartoum. They storm your house and take all valuable things at gunpoint. The resident said many families began to take up arms to defend their properties. He and his brother guard their home at night, he said. You do not have another option. Another resident, in the Arab Market, area said men in RSF uniforms broke into mobile phone shops in the market and looted anything they could carry. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Both sides in the conflict have a long history of human rights abuses. The RSF was born out of the Janjaweed militias, which were accused of widespread atrocities when the government deployed them to put down a rebellion in Sudan's western Darfur region in the early 2000s. Darfur has also seen heavy clashes in the past five days. The aid group Doctors Without Borders, or MSF after its French name, said armed men raided its compound in Nyala in Darfur, stealing vehicles and office equipment and looting a warehouse storing medical supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its office in Nyala was also looted, with one vehicle taken. Foreigners, including diplomats and aid workers, have also been trapped by the fighting, German media, including the DPA news agency, reported that three A400M transport planes were dispatched to evacuate German citizens from Khartoum, but turned around Wednesday due to security concerns in the city. Japan said it was preparing to send military aircraft to evacuate about 60 Japanese nationals. In Brussels, Dana Spinant, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, confirmed reports that a senior EU official had been shot and wounded in Sudan. Spinant did not provide details. The New York Times identified the official as Wim Fransen, a Belgian national. Separately, gunmen broke into the EU ambassador's residence and assaulted him this week, but a spokeswoman said he is back at work. Hospitals in Khartoum are running dangerously low on medical supplies, often operating without power and clean water, the ICRC said in a statement. Dozens of health care facilities in Khartoum and around the country have stopped functioning because they are close to clashes, the Sudanese Doctors' Syndicate said Wednesday. At least nine hospitals were bombed, it said. Our urgent priority is to get medical assistance to hospitals and try to make repairs to their water and power lines so they can treat the wounded, said Patrick Youssef, the ICRC's Africa regional director. But fighting has made it impossible to reach the facilities. The YOU.N.'s World Health Organization said Wednesday at least 296 people have been killed and more than 3,000 wounded since fighting began, without offering a breakdown of civilians and combatants killed. The Doctors' Syndicate, which monitors casualties, said Tuesday that at least 174 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded. The conflict between the military and the RSF has once again derailed Sudan's transition to democratic rule after decades of dictatorship and civil war. A popular uprising four years ago helped depose long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir. But Burhan and Dagalo jointly carried out a 2021 coup. Both generals have a long history of human rights abuses, and their forces have cracked down on pro-democracy activists. Under international pressure, Burhan and Dagalo recently agreed to a framework agreement with political parties and pro-democracy groups. But the signing was repeatedly delayed as tensions rose over the integration of the RSF into the armed forces and the future chain of command.  Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.

The storms will then push east into the Carolinas by Sunday afternoon, posing a threat of damaging winds. A marginal risk for severe storms also includes parts of central Illinois and Indiana. And a batch of fresh storms - capable of producing very large hail, tornadoes and fierce winds - is expected to form across parts of eastern Texas on Sunday afternoon before pushing into Louisiana, Mississippi, and eventually Alabama through the afternoon and evening. 26 killed in a wave of severe storms President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration Sunday for parts Mississippi on after tornado-spawning storms shredded homes and killed 26 people across the South.

A contractor who worked at the Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill died of blastomycosis recently, the Public Health Delta  Menominee Counties said Friday. The health department began investigating an outbreak at the mill last month after sick employees, ailing from pneumonia-like symptoms, tested positive for a fungal infection called blastomycosis. Brian Peterson, the mill's vice president of operations, said in a statement that they were deeply saddened by the death. The contractor has not been identified by the company or health officials. Anyone who works at our facility is part of our team, and we are keeping this individual, their family, coworkers and friends in our thoughts and close to our hearts, Peterson said. Billerud said last week it would be temporarily suspending operations at the mill for up to three weeks for the safety of its employees and contractors. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus that primarily lives in moist soil and decomposing organic matter, such as wood, and it spreads through the inhalation of spores, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can include fever and cough, and people with more weakened immune systems may have more severe cases. The infection can spread to the lungs and other organs, the CDC says. A total of 21 cases have been confirmed by the public health department since March, and more than 70 probable cases have been reported. Of those cases, 12 people have been hospitalized in the outbreak, according to Public Health Delta  Menominee Counties. Billerud, a multinational paper and packaging company based in Sweden, said in a statement to NBC News last week that it has implemented several recommendations from public health experts since the outbreak was identified. Its Michigan mill was founded in 1911 as the Escanaba Pulp and Paper Co. on the bank of the Escanaba River in the state's Upper Peninsula. The river connects to Little Bay de Noc off Lake Michigan. Blastomyces, the fungus responsible for the infection, is typically found in the areas surrounding the Great Lakes, as well as the Ohio, Mississippi and Saint Lawrence rivers, according to the CDC. More than 800 people are employed at the mill, which can produce about 730,000 tons of paper annually, according to Billerud's website.",0,,,"A contractor who worked at the Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill died of blastomycosis.

Kuwait's Al Rai newspaper published a photo of oil gushing out of an oil well, also saying that there have not been injuries reported or any disruption to production. No toxic fumes have been reported, either, company spokesman Qusai al-Amer was quoted as saying. The leak occurred on land but not in a residential area, the spokesperson later told AFP, but declined to specify the exact location of the spill.

It is a horrifyingly normal disaster.","An explosion and fire at a dairy farm on Monday in the Texas panhandle has been called the deadliest cattle barn fire ever recorded: it left one worker in critical condition and killed 18,000 cows. The because of the fire, which occurred at South Fork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, 75 miles northwest of Lubbock, is still under investigation by the state fire marshal. In an interview with a local news station, Castro County Sheriff Sal Rivera said it may have been caused by the facility's manure management equipment. It is possible that it overheated and the methane and things like that might have ignited and spread out with an explosion and a fire, he said. Fires on large-scale animal farms, or factory farms, are surprisingly common. Over the last decade, at least 6.5 million farmed animals, mostly chickens, perished in barn fires in the US, according to Washington, DC-based nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute (AWI). The fires are part of a broader pattern of mass casualty events on factory farms, where 99 percent of America's meat, dairy, and eggs are produced. Some are the result of human or mechanical error, but many stem from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, blizzards, and extreme temperatures, like last summer's scorching heat wave in Kansas that killed thousands of cows who were subsequently dumped in a landfill. Disease outbreaks, too, result in mass death or culling on farms. The Dimmitt fire, however, was unusual in its scale. Because the farm was enormous -- with reportedly 19,000 cattle, it was among the biggest dairy farms in the country -- it killed an order of magnitude more cows than are typically killed in fires, enough to fill 26 football fields, according to a USA Today analysis. For context, the largest number of cows killed in a single fire between 2018 and 2021 in the US was 548. What is so striking about this incident in Texas is just the sheer number of animals that were on the operation in one building to begin with, said Allie Granger, a policy associate with AWI. Frank Brand, who operates the South Fork farm, said he could not provide comment when he was reached by phone Thursday. High death tolls could be more likely in the future as mega-factory farms proliferate, packing ever more animals into cramped warehouse-sized sheds. From 1992 to 2017, the number of US farms with 1,000 or more dairy cows has more than tripled, even as the total number of dairy cows has remained about the same. Fires at livestock and poultry production and storage properties are quite common and have been for years, the National Fire Protection Association reported earlier this year. Animal farms do not have the same fire codes and safety requirements as buildings designed for humans. Farms often lack fire alarms and sprinklers, and they are filled with flammable materials like hay. Barn fires are typically caused by malfunctioning heating or electrical systems, according to the NFPA, and are more common in colder states in the Midwest and Northeast. Fires at large, industrial-scale facilities are particularly concerning because they can wipe out so many animals at once. Chicken factory farms can house hundreds of thousands or even millions of animals each year, so a single fire at one of these facilities can account for the majority of barn fire deaths in a year. Chickens account for about 92 percent of the 6.5 million animals killed in barn fires, with pigs comprising about 2 percent and cows less than 1 percent. The true number is likely significantly higher, AWI notes, because not all states have the same reporting requirements, and because farm animals are property with essentially no legal protection from suffering. Media reports of these incidents often focus on financial losses to farm owners, rather than the immense suffering of farmed animals who burn to death. Fires are not totally avoidable, but more state agencies could help mitigate the risk by adopting the National Fire Protection Association's Fire and Life Safety in Animal Housing Facilities Code, which requires fire protection measures on farms. The latest edition, published in 2022, requires annual fire hazard inspections, contacting emergency services when alarms go off, fire drills, employee training, and minimum spacing between buildings. Only a few states have adopted the code for farms. Meat, dairy, and egg producers themselves could implement relatively straightforward reforms to prevent fires, according to Granger: conduct proactive fire safety inspections alongside fire officials and experts, ensure equipment is routinely checked and maintained, and institute worker training and emergency planning. Unfortunately, the industry has not taken upon themselves to adopt the code and their own standards and guidelines that they use as a part of their certification programs or auditing programs, Granger said. The reporting system for barn fires could also be improved in order to better understand its scope -- fire officials often fail to include the number of animals who have died in their incident reports. The more fundamental problem, though, is factory farms' size, which can make for disturbingly high death counts from fires and other disasters, and can make them harder to prevent and contain. That was evident, for example, in last year's bird flu outbreak, in which the poultry industry resorted to exterminating tens of millions of farmed birds through a ghastly method called ventilation shutdown plus, essentially killing them via heatstroke. In a letter last May, Gwendolen Reyes-Illg, a veterinary adviser to AWI, urged the nation's largest veterinary association to advocate for restrictions on factory farm size, arguing that the spread of mega-factory farms was contributing to the use of that cruel method because meat producers found it impractical to deploy other cull methods in such large facilities. For many types of natural disasters and disease outbreaks -- although not for barn fires unless they began as a wildfire -- meat producers receive taxpayer-funded reimbursements to recoup their losses, and there is been recent movement in Congress to hold the livestock industry accountable for such disasters. Late last year, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced a bill that, among other provisions, requires large meat and egg producers to prepare for disasters and pay the costs of dealing with them, including cleanup and disposal of animal carcasses. The idea is that forcing the industry to internalize some of its risk would prevent producers from inflicting harm for free. The bill stands little chance of moving through this Congress, but it is a sign, among others, that the public health and environmental problems wrought by factory farming are becoming increasingly difficult for Washington to ignore. For America's big agricultural states, including Texas -- where everything's bigger -- the Dimmitt tragedy should be a wakeup call about the risks of a food system increasingly dependent on super-sized factory farms.",1,,,"18,000 cows were killed in a fire at a Texas dairy farm on Monday.

While port executives have sought to downplay the potential of a significant job action, fears of disruptions have already been weighing on people while recent events are only serving to increase the concerns. ILWU Local 13, the union's largest local on the West Coast, has continued to disrupt operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's largest port complex, writes the Pacific Maritime Association in a statement released on April 13. While the union is using new tactics, the result is the same: the disruption of terminal operations. The PMA which represents employers at the 70 terminals located in the West Coast ports is detailing a series of complaints, writing Together, these illegal work actions have disrupted activities at some of the largest and most active terminals in the United States, which play a critical role in the movement of cargo to and from markets throughout the nation. Among the tactics they are citing as being used by the Local are unilaterally delayed the standard dispatch process, which is jointly administered by PMA and ILWU. They are accusing the ILWU of refusing to let the PMA participate in the labor dispatch process, resulting in slowing the start of work on each shift. They also say the union has forced crucial cargo handling equipment to be taken out of operation at several key terminals. These latest issues follow last week when members of Local 13 did not show up for their assigned shifts on Thursday, April 6, in the afternoon and again for morning shifts on April 7. Terminals across both ports were forced to suspend operations for approximately 24 hours due to a shortage of workers. The PMA also repeats its position that the Local stopped complying with a contract provision, about a month ago that permits staggered shifts during breaks for meal periods. The goal is to permit cargo to continue to be received and delivered without interruption during the break periods. For its part, the ILWU Local 13 said last week's labor shortage was due to a monthly union meeting on Thursday evening, which this month involved the swearing in of a newly elected president of the local. Friday, they noted, was a religious holiday where some workers wanted to be with their families. Longshore workers at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach (Ports) are still hard at work and remain committed to moving the nation's cargo, said the ILWU Local 13. Asked to comment on the labor issues during his monthly update, Gene Seroka, Executive Director of the Port of Los Angeles, on Wednesday, April 12, sought to downplay last week's disruptions saying it was a slow period due to the holiday. He told reporters, I do not see a widespread labor disruption at any time in the future. Seroka however said last week's actions were a call to action, reiterating his position for months that a settlement needs to be reached as quickly as possible. He said after last week all eyes are on the contract negotiations and the time has come to get a settlement to remove uncertainties and the fear of wider disruptions to supply chains and the nation's economy. While saying he expected soft volumes in the second quarter, Seroka said he sees signs beginning to appear and forecasts a moderate increase by the third quarter. The National Retail Federation has also said they expect volumes to continue monthly increases, but they also warned of the dangers to the recovery from labor actions at the West Coast ports. The retail trade association expressed its concerns before last week's job actions and today's statement from the PMA.",1,,,"International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Local 13 continues to disrupt operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, writes the Pacific Maritime Association.

When she highlighted the same, it was in vain. She was later sacked by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) as well but her fight for flight safety continues. Mangala Narasimhan (54) was an air traffic controller (ATC) and Aviation Safety Officer posted at Mumbai airport when she noticed several air safety violations. Since the lives of thousands of passengers were at stake, she took up these issues with her higher ups, but in vain. Among other things, gross violation of height restriction rules by buildings coming in the way of the take-off and landing funnels of the airport was particularly worrying her. When a PIL was filed by a lawyer at Bombay High Court, she was made a respondent, in which capacity she placed all the facts before the judges. She was rewarded by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) by being sacked. In an interview, Mangala spoke to S Balakrishnan on her fight for flight safety. Excerpts: What prompted you to start the fight for flight safety? A childhood incident was responsible for it. I was only 17 years old studying in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu. My elder brother, an NDA graduate whom I hero worshipped, was an air force navigator on AN32 transport aircraft. Once when I returned home from school, I found him crying like a child on our mother's lap. He was sad that some of his colleagues were killed in an accident at Ludhiana. It was a nine aircraft formation and he was in aircraft number 3. Aircraft number 6 and 7 collided during the final approach of landing. The year was 1983-1984. That scene at my home left a deep impression on me. I realised how important flight safety was. I subsequently cleared the exams to become an ATC; a job that I regarded as a mission aimed at flight safety. Many of the air accidents could have been avoided if necessary precautions had been taken. My repeated warnings from 2012 onwards about latent dangerous conditions at Mumbai airport's main Runway 0927 and Calicut airport were ignored by the authorities. The same latent dangerous conditions at Calicut airport's runway resulted in an accident on August 7, 2020, in which 19 innocent passengers and the two pilots were killed. The accident was blamed on pilot error. The pilots are dead and cannot defend themselves. But the fact is that the authorities ignored my warnings and that was the reason for the loss of lives. Mumbai airport's main runway 09  27 is still unsafe. You have been accused of violating the organisational chain of command in AAI. Please comment. Air safety does not need any celebratory protocol. If your immediate superior does not respond to your warnings, then you are at liberty to approach the higher ups. The safety of lakhs of passengers is at stake. It should not be compromised on bureaucratic red tape. I only functioned like a conscientious ATC official. What specific air safety issues did you take up? With respect to Mumbai, air safety violations are in four categories: unsafe runway conditions, violations of rules framed by international civil aviation safety organisation, AAI and the DGCA, tall buildings within a 20-km radius of the airport and non-reporting of air safety incidents to me by Mumbai ATC. More than 85 of accidents take place during take off or landing when the reaction time for the pilot is very less. How many buildings are violating air safety norms in Mumbai? An AAI  MIAL Obstacle survey in 2010-11 revealed 439 obstacles on the take-off and landing paths alone. In between buildings were not considered. Apparently, the 2020 survey revealed 1,140 obstacles in the narrow take off and landing funnels. In 2014 a PIL was filed by a lawyer in Bombay High Court on this issue and in 2018 I was permitted to file a fresh petition. The matter is still pending. Is it true that you were sacked by the AAI? The HC judgment permitting me to file a petition was passed on April 6, 2018, and 10 days after that I was dismissed by the AAI. I have challenged my illegal dismissal. I am certain I will win because my fight is for air safety. When a passenger dies in a crash, his entire family suffers. Powerful builders tried to win me over and even told me that my objections would be overruled by the powers that be. I am certain that the HC will give weightage to the safety of passengers and not to the interests of builders and those who protect them.",0,,,"Mangala Narasimhan (54) was an air traffic controller (ATC) and Aviation Safety Officer posted at Mumbai airport.

After the government rested its case, Michel's lead lawyer, David Kenner, delivered a 25-minute statement that leaned heavily into his client's upbringing and commercial success -- a stark contrast to the government's approach in late March when federal prosecutors gave their opening statement. While prosecutors last month alluded to Michel's successful album in the 90s, they generally avoided discussing his celebrity status. Kenner took the opposite approach Monday, reminding jurors that Michel had grown up in poverty before founding the Fugees with Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean and achieving wealth and fame by age 25. Kenner then moved on to describing the first couple of chance meetings between Michel and his absent co-defendant Jho Low, a Malaysian billionaire who is suspected of stealing billions form a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB. Low has not been arrested and remains an international fugitive. Michel saw Low spend ridiculous amounts of money on celebrity friends, real estate, entertainment companies and other ventures, Kenner said. Michel has been charged with felonies alleging his participation in a conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions using foreign money, witness tampering and failure to register as a foreign agent of the Chinese government. The most serious of the charges carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Michel has pleaded not guilty to all charges. During their opening statement, prosecutors portrayed Michel as cash-strapped and willing to do the bidding of a foreign government in exchange for a payday. Kenner did not deny that Michel was paid for work he did with Low, but told jurors Monday there was nothing illegal about the payments. The evidence will show that making money, even if you consider it greedy, is not a crime, he said. Kenner also told jurors that Michel, Low and others involved in their alleged scheme to lobby the Trump administration never agreed to violate the Foreign Agent Registration Act by concealing their efforts. Such a conspiracy never, ever existed, Kenner said. Kenner also stressed to jurors that FARA is a law that is violated when individuals fail to disclose political work on behalf of foreign interest. This is not a James Bond spying kind of statute, he said. It is not cloak and dagger kind of stuff. No one in Michel's orbit told him that he needed to register as a foreign agent, Kenner said.",0,,,"Defense lawyers for Pras Michel begin presenting their case in federal court.

CNN,"CNN -- The footage quickly spread on social media, as these things often do. Tiger Woods gingerly walking towards his caddie after an approach shot, seven cautious steps in the miserable Augusta rain which told us more about the limitations Woods says he faces than words ever could. He did not grimace - a single-minded champion like Woods would not - but plenty watching the clip would have as they saw him struggling to walk. He was just about managing to play the game he had once dominated. At this point, Woods was nine-over at The Masters, dropping shots at nearly every hole in the third round to leave him bottom of the leaderboard. He had previously squeezed through the cut with a three-over overall score at the halfway mark. This clearly was not the Woods of old, but it is been quite some time since we saw that powerful, athletic, all-conquering version of the 15-time major winner. Many would have quit there and then. For Woods, who famously won the 2008 US Open with a fractured leg, that came the next day as organizers announced he had withdrawn before the resumption of the rain-hit third round. Woods explained minutes later on Twitter that a foot injury (plantar fasciitis - a tissue inflammation that causes pain in the heel) was the because of the discomfort we had seen. His body weakened by multiple surgeries and injuries, the elements were against him. The cold and rain do not suit a man who needs an extensive warm-up routine to get his body to acquiesce to the demands of tournament golf. Or, perhaps, the weather saved him from himself. I hate to say this but yesterday (Saturday) at the end of this show I was just hoping that he would not make the cut, that he would just finish one outside, Sky Sports analyst Butch Harmon said. Not because I do not want to see Tiger Woods play, we always want to see Tiger Woods play, but you could just see he was in agony trying to get around there and it was not a surprise at all to be honest that he had to withdraw. The schedule, too, became unkind for the former world No.1, and the undulating course was already a challenge for his right leg, held together by rods, screws, plates and pins after a serious car crash in 2021.

Mark BakerAP Masters 2023: The best pictures from Augusta Prev Next An early wake-up on Saturday to finish a second round, which had been suspended Friday because of the weather, before taking to the tee again later in the day to start the third round, was a physical test. For Woods to play more than 18 holes in a day - which would have been the requirement on Sunday as organizers tried to complete a rain-hit tournament in the scheduled four days - seemed, at best, optimistic, even without injury. He has played just one competitive tournament this season and told reporters in the build-up to The Masters that he does not play or practice much anymore. In the end, he managed 14 holes on Saturday (seven in the second round; seven in the third) and his body could do no more. Had Woods completed four rounds at Augusta, questions would still be asked about his future. He had suggested last week that this could be his final Masters appearance and admitted that he was in constant pain during the opening round on Thursday. But now we wonder not only if Woods will ever again attempt to negotiate Augusta's hilly terrain, but also whether he will tee off at another major. We know all about Woods' past: the 15 major titles, the 82 PGA Tour wins, the millions earned, the skill, the determination, the affairs he admitted to before the world's media, the multiple back injuries, the surgeries, the redemptive 2019 Masters win, and the career-threatening car crash. Woods has gone from top of the world to rock bottom and back again. But aged 47, the future is uncertain. He is no longer the best golfer around. He is no longer one of the best. The truth is, it is unclear how good he now is or how good he still could be. Tiger Woods walks to the green on the 13th hole during the third round of the Masters. Matt SlocumAP Woods spoke of completing four rounds at Augusta National last year as a small victory, but also told reporters last week: I just have to be cognizant of how much I can push it. It is been a tough, tough road. I do not know how many more (Masters) I have in me. Will he continue to put his body through tournament golf just to be an also-ran? Can the greats ever become accustomed to being average? Not that Woods will ever just be a regular player, as the headlines his Masters withdrawal generated testify. Arguably, he is still the biggest draw in the game. Harmon told Sky Sports that he thought Woods would play another major. If you look where The Open is this year Royal Liverpool it is fairly flat ... US Open in LA - yes, the LA Country Club's got some hills and stuff. The difficulty here Augusta National is the walk, it is just such a tough walk for everybody and so I think it had to happen for his sake. Will we see him again? Gosh I hope so ... Can he ever win another one? I would never say Tiger Woods cannot do something because every time we think that, he proves us wrong - he did a few years ago right here at Augusta.",0,,,"Tiger Woods withdraws from The Masters with a foot injury. Woods was nine-over at the halfway point of the third round. Woods had previously squeezed through the cut with a three-over overall score. Woods won the 2008 US Open with a fractured leg, that came the next day as organizers announced he had withdrawn before the resumption of the rain-hit third round in Augusta, Georgia.

Ancient Babylonian treasures, painstakingly unearthed, are slowly disappearing again under wind-blown sand in a land parched by rising heat and prolonged droughts. Iraq is among the countries worst-hit by climate change. It endured a dozen major sandstorms last year. When the storms clear, layers of fine sand cover everything, including the Sumerian ruins of Umm al-Aqarib, the Mother of Scorpions, in the southern desert province of Dhi Qar. Sandstorms have slowly begun to reverse years of work there to unearth the temples' terracotta facades and many priceless artifacts, said archaeologist Aqeel al-Mansrawi. Archaeologists in Iraq have always had to shovel sand, but now the volumes are growing. After a decade of worsening storms, sand at Umm al-Aqarib now covers a good part of the site, that dates back to around 2350 BECAUSE and spans more than five square kilometers, he said. In the past, the biggest threat was looting of antiquities at the ruins, where pottery fragments and clay tablets bearing ancient cuneiform script have been discovered. Now the changing weather and its impact on the land, especially creeping desertification, spell an additional threat to ancient sites all across southern Iraq, said Mansrawi. In the next 10 years, he said, it is estimated that sand could have covered 80 to 90 percent of the archaeological sites. Last year, a study published in the journal Antiquites found that climate change is affecting archaeological sites and landscapes around the world. As well as desertification, extreme weather events such as increased rainfall, coastal erosion and rising sea levels have threatened archeological treasures globally.

The safety advisory from the Federal Railroad Administration stopped short of telling the railroads exactly what to do. Instead, it encouraged them to make sure the detectors are getting inspected often enough by trained employees and that the railroads have safe standards for determining when to stop a train or park a railcar when a warning is triggered. The National Transportation Safety Board has said the crew operating the Norfolk Southern train that derailed outside East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border on February 3 got a warning from such a detector but could not stop the train before more than three dozen cars came off the tracks and caught fire. The Federal Railroad Administration said overheating bearings likely caused at least four other derailments since 2021. The Ohio derailment forced half the town of about 5,000 people to evacuate for days as toxic chemicals burned, leaving residents with lingering health concerns. Government tests have not found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area. The EPA opened an office in the town Tuesday to help address residents' questions. For trains containing hazardous materials, the potential consequence of a derailment is catastrophic, and allowing a train transporting a hazardous material to continue to operate, without restriction, after an HBD (hot bearing detector) alert is likely not appropriate, the FRA advisory said. Norfolk Southern officials did not immediately respond to the advisory. After the NTSB issued its preliminary findings last week, the railroad said the derailment had prompted it to inspect all of the nearly 1,000 trackside heat detectors on its network. That was on top of regular inspections it normally does on those sensors every 30 days, Norfolk Southern said. Dave Clarke, the former director of the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee, said the safety advisory was not surprising. This is just FRA proposing the obvious, in my opinion. I doubt if any Class I (major freight railroad) was waiting for this, he said. But railroad labor groups welcomed the move. Unions say the major freight railroads have become riskier because workers are spread so thin after deep job cuts over the past six years, inspections are being rushed, and preventative maintenance may be neglected. There are no federal regulations guiding wayside detectors, including their placement along tracks or temperature thresholds. There is not even a federal definition of wayside detection technologies, said Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all rail unions. Rail workers are eager to see a complete set of federal regulations on the installation, operation, testing, repairs, and maintenance of all wayside detection technologies, including defect detectors. In the Ohio derailment, the bearing that failed got hotter as it passed three detectors before the crash but did not get hot enough to set off a warning until the last detector, according to the NTSB. The FRA said railroads should consider developing ways to analyze temperature trends those sensors spot to help identify potential problems sooner. The Association of American Railroads trade group said the industry has a strong track record of pushing for safety improvements and tough tank car standards to prevent hazardous materials spills. The group said the widespread use of these detectors is an example of the industry's commitment to safety. Professor Allan Zarembski, who leads the University of Delaware's rail engineering and safety program, noted that overheating bearings because only a handful of the more than 1,000 derailments each year, indicating that the existing system already finds nearly all such problems. There is great political pressure to do something now -- knee-jerk reaction, 'Do something now. We have got to do something now.' But I am not convinced the knee-jerk reaction is going to do a lot of good, Zarembski said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg proposed a number of safety improvements last week, but the industry has been pushing to delay any major changes until after the NTSB completes its investigation a year or more from now.",1,,,"The Federal Railroad Administration says overheating bearings likely caused at least four other derailments since 2021.

Hundreds of thousands of workers in various industries went on strike in what could be the biggest walkout since the current wave of industrial action started last year. Members of several trade unions have taken action, mounting hundreds of picket lines amid ongoing anger over issues including pay, jobs, pensions and conditions. The Tube strike by drivers in the Aslef and Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) unions has resulted in no service on any Tube line, according to Transport for London. The Docklands Light Railway and Elizabeth line were also part-suspended because of the strike - as huge crowds were pictured cramped in tunnels at Tottenham Court Road station - with the mass shutdown resulting in an increase in road congestion. Separately this morning, there were also delays between Watford and London Euston due to an trespasser; Watford and Clapham Junction due to a points failure; Charing Cross and London Bridge due to overrunning engineering works; Bromley North and Grove Park due to a delayed driver; Twickenham due to a signalling fault; Margate and Herne Bay due to a broken down train; and Reading due to a signalling fault. TomTom said at 8am the average time it took to drive 10km (6.2 miles) in London was three minutes longer than normal at that time, at 21 minutes and 17 seconds. There were huge queues at Tottenham Court Road this morning, where the Elizabeth Line is still running Large queues form for buses outside London Victoria railway station today as the strike begins People queue for a bus outside Stratford railway station in East London early this morning London Underground trains sit unused at Northfields depot in West London this morning A passenger walks past closed gates at Stratford station in East London this morning The geolocation technology company added that there were 1,419 traffic jams in the capital stretching for a total of 1,065km (662 miles). Who is taking part in the Budget Day strikes These are the sectors affected by the Budget Day walkouts today: Civil service Around 130,000 members of the Public and Commercial Services union and thousands of civil servants in Prospect are involved in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. More than 130 Government departments, agencies and sites - including the British Museum and British Library, as well as the Border Force - will be affected. Education Members of the National Education Union in England will strike as part of a long-running dispute over pay. The strike will continue on Thursday, causing huge disruption to schools. Universities More than 70,000 staff members of the University and College Union (UCU) will begin the first of three successive days of strike action across 150 universities in the UK. The UCU is currently in negotiations with the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents 144 employers, via the conciliation service Acas. UCU members are set to strike for another three days from Monday next week. London Underground Drivers in Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport union will strike in a dispute over pensions and conditions. Tube services will be crippled all day, with a knock-on effect likely on Thursday morning. Health Junior doctors in the British Medical Association will strike for the third successive day in a row over pay. BBC Members of the National Union of Journalists at BBC Local in England will strike in protest at programme cuts. Advertisement Those striking today include teachers, university lecturers, civil servants, junior doctors, London Underground drivers and BBC journalists. Despite talks being held between unions and the Westminster Government, the public sector strikes remain deadlocked. Some of the strikes, such as those by teachers, will only be held in England as progress has been made in Wales and Scotland. This morning, an Aslef organiser denied that London Underground workers were striking to earn more pay. Finn Brennan, its district organiser for the London underground, told LBC: 'This is actually the first time Aslef have taken action across the underground since 2015. It comes after our members voted by 99 per cent in favour of the strike. 'It is not a strike about pay, it is not a strike looking for more time off. 'We simply want TfL to commit to negotiate with us about changes instead of trying to impose changes. 'There is a huge hole in TfL's budget as a result of the pandemic and they want to fill that by cutting staff numbers, cutting working conditions and crucially cutting staff pensions. 'We have always said we are prepared to negotiate change but quite understandably and quite rightly our members are not prepared to pay the price for the hole that has been left in TfL's budget by the Government's failure to properly fund public transport in London.' Mr Brennan added that further strike action on the Underground was 'very likely', saying: 'Yes, I am afraid so. 'I do think it is going to be very likely unless there is a change of course from the Government who are pulling the strings at TfL and unless London underground is properly funded so we can deliver a decent service for the people of London.' Mr Brennan earlier praised all unions striking today for timing their strikes to be simultaneous. He said: 'It is rock solid action. 'It does fit in with action that is happening - as you spoke to teachers... all of these strikes come from the same root because: the failure by the Government to fund the vital public services that people need.' Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka warned the action is just the start of strikes that could last until the end of the year. He said: 'On Budget Day we are asking Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to give our hard-working members a fair pay rise. We have been given a 2 per cent pay rise when food inflation was 16 per cent last week. '40,000 civil servants use food banks and 45,000 claim in-work benefits because they are so poor. The Government can stop these strikes today by putting money on the table for our members. Closed gates at London Paddington Underground station this morning due to the Tube strike Strike signage at London Paddington station this morning as the industrial action begins Closed gates at London Paddington Underground station this morning due to the Tube strike 'If they do not, our action will escalate. Where the Westminster Government has a direct involvement in disputes, very little progress has been made. All Tube lines have been severely affected by the strikes, with most suspended throughout the day 'Shamefully, ministers do not seem interested in giving their own employees a fair pay rise to help them through the cost-of-living crisis and beyond.' It comes after it was revealed that Britain has lost more than 1.5million working days to a string of industrial disputes. The Office for National Statistics said 220,000 days were lost to strikes in January, added to 822,000 in December and 462,000 in November. And the huge scale of disruption across whole swathes of the economy - from rail and postal workers to NHS staff and teachers - shows little sign of abating. This is in spite of figures showing public sector pay growth of 4.8 per cent in those months - the strongest since the New Labour era in 2006 if the pandemic period is disregarded. Private sector workers did better with pay up by 7 per cent, but the gap between the two is narrowing. However, everyone feels poorer as double-digit inflation eats into the value of wages. Ministers are facing huge pressure to settle public sector disputes by putting up pay - as well as separate demands to ease the tax burden on struggling businesses and to give the armed forces a much-needed boost in defence spending. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), joins a rally and protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London yesterday Strikes due this week include a walkout on London's Tube trains today and stoppages on other rail lines tomorrow and on Saturday. Rail and Tube passengers face day of chaos today as unions shut down Underground in walkout over pay with more chaos to come later this week - see if your journey will be affected When is the Tube strike? A strike on the London Underground is taking place on Wednesday. This will also affect services into Thursday morning. The strike by members of the RMT and Aslef unions relates to an ongoing dispute over pay, pensions, job losses and working conditions. How will Tube services be affected today? Little or no service is expected across the entire Tube network today. Based on previous strike days, there could be infrequent shuttle services on the outskirts of some lines, but these should not be replied upon. Will London Overground services run today? London Overground services are expected to run mostly as normal today, but they will be much busier than usual and queuing systems could be in place. Transport for London also warned the closure of Tube stations could mean some services will be unable to stop at all stations or run to their normal destination. How will Elizabeth line services be affected today? No service on the Elizabeth line is expected between Paddington and Abbey Wood or Stratford before 7.30am or after 10.30pm today. Services will also be much busier than normal and queuing systems may be in place, and trains may not be able to stop at all stations due to the closure of Tube stations. Will Docklands Light Railway run today? DLR services and trams should run as normal today, although the closure of Underground stations may mean some services will be unable to stop at all stations. TfL also warned there will be no step-free access for the DLR at Bank today - and if the station is able to open, the Monument entrance will have to be used. Will the Tube strike affect buses today? Bus services should run as normal today but will be much busier, particularly from mainline railway stations. How will Tube and Overground services be affected tomorrow? Tomorrow, Tube services will start later than normal and will be disrupted through the morning. London Overground, trams and DLR trains are expected to run as normal. How will Elizabeth line services be affected tomorrow? There is also a separate National Rail strike starting on Thursday which will affect the Elizabeth line. Services between Paddington and Abbey WoodStratford will start later than normal tomorrow. There will also be no Elizabeth line between Shenfield and Brentwood before 7am and after 11pm, and no service between Maidenhead and Reading before 7am and after 7pm. There will be no westbound service from Paddington until 7am. Will the Tube be affected by the National Rail strike on Saturday? Most TfL services should run as normal on Saturday, however there are various engineering works taking place which could impact journeys. In addition, the Elizabeth line will be affected by the National Rail strike on both days - with roughly the same service patterns as outlined in the above answer. What closures will there be on the Tube network this Saturday? There are a series of closures on the Tube network planned for Saturday: Circle line - No service until 8.30am on the entire lineDistrict line - No service until 8.30am on the entire line.

No service between Richmond and Willesden JunctionNo service between South Tottenham and Barking RiversideNo service between Highbury  Islington and New Cross  Clapham Junction  Crystal Palace  West CroydonAdvertisement Teachers are striking in England today and tomorrow and there is also a three-day walk-out by junior doctors this week. Yesterday, a senior health chief warned that the NHS cannot 'go on like this' and urged the Government to strike a deal with the unions as soon as possible. Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers said: 'Unlike previous strikes, it is noticeable that there has been no let-up in the demand for care. 'Senior doctors are stepping into the breach but it is not business as usual. The knock-on effects of a three-day strike will be felt for a long time to come,' he added. Multiple rows over pay and conditions have been rumbling on for months across many different parts of the economy. Last year the number of days lost to strikes totalled 2.47million, the highest level since 1989 when Margaret Thatcher was in power and more than 4million days were lost. It was even worse earlier in the decade with more than 27 million days lost in 1984. The disruption peaked in 1979 with more than 29million days lost, including 12million in September alone that year. The new figures pale in comparison, but show a steadily worsening pattern since last summer. In August, 357,000 days were lost and in September it was 210,000 while October saw the number tick up to 422,000. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the National Education Union said: 'We do not want to go on strike - we want to be in the classroom, teaching and supporting children and young people. 'It continues to be a regret that our members have to take strike action, but we know that parents and the public understand the gravity of the situation around school funding and teacher recruitment and retention. 'The NEU, as we have always stated, is prepared to enter talks at any point, and as and when through negotiation a reasonable offer from Government is made we will pause strike action while the offer is put to members. 'This is exactly what happened last week in Wales. Gillian Keegan (Education Secretary) needs to take a leaf out of the Welsh Government's book, stop playing politics and get down to serious negotiation.' Passengers were urged to check before travelling by Tube in London because of disruption caused by a strike by members of Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT). In a letter to the London mayor, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: 'As you know, at this moment, London Underground managers are imposing new rosters across our Tube stations which are based on cutting 600 station staff jobs. 'In January, I wrote to you raising my serious concerns about the safety consequences of these cuts. Because they are now so short-staffed, managers appear to be mis-using waivers in order to override agreed minimum safe staffing levels at Tube stations. 'This means that stations are now opening with too few or, in some cases, no staff. I asked for a moratorium on these station staff cuts while an investigation took place, yet managers are proceeding with the use of the new rosters.' Finn Brennan of Aslef said the Government's failure to properly fund public transport in the capital is to blame. He warned further strikes are 'inevitable' unless the row is resolved. Glynn Barton, Transport for London's chief operating officer, said: 'Customers should check before they travel and we are advising them to expect very limited or no service on the Tube on Wednesday. 'The majority of TfL services will be running as normal but may be subject to last minute changes, including non-stopping at some stations shared with London Underground. 'Disruption should be expected on the Tube network into the morning on Thursday.' Members of the National Union of Journalists working at BBC Local across England will stage a 24-hour strike in a row over programme cuts. Meanwhile junior doctors in the British Medical Association will continue with a three-day stoppage they launched on Monday over pay. NHS Providers chief executive Sir Julian Hartley said: 'So far, so difficult for the NHS - but the health service is still there for patients. 'Unlike previous strikes, it is noticeable that there has been no let-up in the demand for care. 'Senior doctors are stepping into the breach but it is not business as usual. For hospital patients that means it is taking longer for admissions and the discharge process is also slower. 'Ambulance handover delays are up too. 'We are seeing increased levels of cover by senior doctors in mental health and community services but it is not sustainable and trust leaders are worried about 'burning goodwill'. 'The planning effort involved in preparing for the strike and keeping services going has been huge and has taken leaders' time away from other work. We cannot go on like this. The knock-on effects of a three-day strike will be felt for a long time to come. 'We need the Government and the doctors' unions to come to an agreement quickly.' Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: 'Our members in the public sector have seen their incomes decline by up to 26 per cent over the past 13 years and their work taken for granted - they have had enough. 'Poor pay and declining morale represent an existential threat to the Civil Service's ability to function, and to our ability to regulate and deliver on the Government's priorities. 'Bills are rocketing and pay is falling ever further behind the private sector leaving our members with no option but to take industrial action. 'We will continue our campaign until the Government comes up with a meaningful offer. If it does not do so soon, we may be left with no Civil Service to protect.' Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said in an open letter to parents: 'This industrial action will mean more disruption to children's education and to your lives too - whether that is work, arranging childcare or changing other plans. 'I am extremely disappointed that many young people will once again miss invaluable time learning with their teachers and friends, particularly after their education was significantly disrupted during the pandemic. 'It is made worse by the fact that this strike action is completely unnecessary. As I said to the NEU three weeks ago, I want to get around the table and engage in serious talks on teachers' pay and other issues to resolve disputes. 'My only condition was that strike action is paused so those discussions can take place in good faith and without disruption. 'This was the same offer, and the same condition, made to unions representing nurses, ambulance workers and physiotherapists. Those unions accepted that offer, paused their strikes and are now negotiating on behalf of their members in private. 'The NEU instead seems focused on strikes and all the needless disruption that brings. 'This morning I have written to the unions again to invite them to have those talks on Wednesday and Thursday this week - all they need to do is call off strikes which are unnecessary and benefit no-one.' How will you be affected by the National Rail strike tomorrow and on Saturday? When is the next National Rail strike? Strikes at 14 train operating companies will go ahead this Thursday and Saturday, despite the RMT calling off its walkout at Network Rail.

Here is what we know so far: The accident occurred at around 11:30 pm on Tuesday (2130 GMT) near Larissa in the Tempe Valley of Thessaly, central Greece, about 380 kilometres (236 miles) north of Athens, on the main railway line between the capital and Thessaloniki. The passenger train, with 342 passengers and ten employees on board, slammed head-on into a freight train travelling on the same track in the opposite direction, officials said. A fire broke out, apparently in the restaurant car that was among the three leading carriages. All ten train employees are believed to have died in the crash. ALSO READ: Train accident in Greece kills at least 32 At least 47 people have been confirmed dead by the fire department, but several more are known to have been trapped in the restaurant car and have yet to be extricated. Most of the casualties were in the first three carriages, which included first-class seats. Over 80 people were hurt. Most of the passengers were students returning to Thessaloniki after a long Carnival weekend. ALSO READ: Toll rises to 42 in Greek train crash, minister resigns Fire and rescue crews at the scene said they found apocalyptic scenes reminiscent of a war zone. Once we arrived at the scene of the disaster, our teams found themselves in an apocalyptic landscape, Yiannis Goulas, president of the union of emergency response workers (Ekav), told state broadcaster ERT on Wednesday. People covered in blood were running around asking for help. People strewn across the fields after being thrown out of broken windows, he added. Images of the burned-out, mangled carriages at the front of the passenger train were broadcast live nonstop by media outlets. Two cranes were deployed to help pry apart the crumpled metal to search for survivors and bodies. ALSO READ: Humanitarian crises: Less response in African countries Hours after the crash, the Larissa station manager was arrested after giving a statement to police. The 59-year-old man is being prosecuted for negligent homicide and causing involuntary bodily harm. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everything shows that the drama was, sadly, mainly due to a tragic human error, and Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned over the accident. On Thursday, government spokesman Yiannis Economou said the station manager had confessed his responsibility for the accident. I believe the responsibility, the negligence, the error has been confessed by the station master, Economou said. But he also admitted delays in installing safety safeguards on the route where the accident took place, a result of chronic malaise and decades of failure in state management. ALSO READ: France records 22-ton jump in cocaine seizures Greece's rail network, with a total 2,552 kilometres (1,585 miles) of track, has long been plagued by mismanagement, poor maintenance, obsolete equipment and service delays. The head of the train drivers' union, Kostas Genidounias, said that trains were routed manually, as the electronic (safety) systems have not worked since 2000. In 2017, Greek state rail operator Trainose was acquired by the Italian public company Ferrovie Dello Stato Italiane (FS) and renamed Hellenic Train, part of a sweeping privatisation program mandated by Greece's creditors during the country's decade-long debt crisis. Hellenic Train has been criticised for being unable to provide detailed information on the passengers, hampering the search and rescue operations. In a statement Wednesday, the company said it was working closely with authorities and has offered financial support to the passengers.",1,,,"At least 47 people have been confirmed dead by the fire department.

The union said today more than 560 workers in Coventry will walk out on April 16th to 18th and again on April 21st to 23rd in an ongoing dispute over pay that has already seen members take eight days of strike action. GMB also said its members at five other fufillment centres in the Midlands will begin balloting over industrial action, specifically in Mansfield, Coalville, Kegworth, Rugeley and Rugby. The union said the ballots would run for several weeks. GMB senior organiser Amanda Gearing said: Industrial action is growing, and this could fast become a summer of strike chaos at Amazon. Three months ago, Amazon told our members there was no money left for pay rises, yet through pressure, campaigning and strike action we have forced Amazon to sit up and take notice. Six further days of strike action in Coventry is a clear statement from our members they are worth more; they will not accept a pay rise of pennies from one of the world's wealthiest corporations. With workers at five further sites starting ballots for industrial action this month, it is clear Amazon need to urgently get serious and talk pay with GMB now. Workers at the Coventry warehouse staged the first strike in the UK in Amazon's history on January 25th, following an industrial action ballot that saw 98 vote to strike on a turnout of more than 63. GMB said members had voted to strike in anger over the company's 50p-per-hour pay offer. According to the union, its members currently receive 10.50 per hour. GMB has called for pay to be increased to 15 per hour. Amazon told ITV News in December that the company offers competitive pay which starts at a minimum of between 10.50 and 11.45 per hour depending on location, which it said represents a 29 increase since 2018. GMB announced seven further days of strike action by workers in Coventry last month, with members walking out on February 28th and March 2nd, before taking part in a week-long strike from March 13th to 17th. Amazon announced in July 2022 that its total UK revenues rose by 12.6 during the previous year to 23.2bn. Amazon UK Services, the company's warehouse and logistics operation, grew its revenues by just over a quarter to 6.09bn. In an interview with LabourList in December, TUC general secretary Paul Nowak identified Amazon as an employer that unions globally have got to get to grips with, adding that he hopes the strike action by workers in Coventry will be a little bit of the spark that lights the flame.",0,,,"More than 560 workers in Coventry will walk out on April 16th to 18th and again on April 21st to 23rd in ongoing dispute over pay.

The Theseus crude tanker was in the Gulf of Guinea on Monday, according to data from MarineTraffic. The tanker loaded with what is believed to be Russian crude oil departed from Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk at the end of January. It arrived close to Ghana's coasts at the end of February, but it had been anchored off the shore waiting for permission to dock and discharge the cargo. The 600,000 barrels of crude that the tanker carried from Novorossiysk to Ghana were the first observed cargo from Russia to the African country in at least four years, according to Bloomberg. The six-week wait was prompted by national security concerns, sources said. One of the people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Ghana had allowed the tanker to dock after claims that the crude oil was from Kazakhstan. But according to data from tanker data firms and a port agent for Novorossiysk, the tanker was shipping Russian crude. The buyer of the cargo, believed to be Platon Gas Oil Ghana Ltd, is not expected to process the crude for at least six months, and will store the oil in storage tanks it has leased from the Tema oil refinery, where the cargo was delivered this weekend, according to local energy experts. Apart from Asia, Russia has turned to Africa to sell more of its crude oil, after the EU embargoes on seaborne imports of Russia's oil and fuels. Ghana in West Africa could be a rare occurrence for Russian oil purchases, but countries in North Africa have become key export outlets of Russia's diesel and other petroleum products after the EU ban on imports of Russian fuels took effect in early February.",1,,,"An oil tanker that had waited for permission to dock for six weeks was cleared to discharge the oil this weekend.

Lloyd's Register has awarded Approval in Principle (AiP) to Hyundai's new Onboard Guidance System, which is designed to help containerships prevent excessive rolling. The container industry has long struggled to understand the phenomenon known as parametric rolling and how to prevent its impact on vessels. Incident reports have directly linked ships experiencing these sudden onset motions and the loss of containers. Calling a recent increase in the number of containers lost at sea and reversal of the downward trend concerning, the World Shipping Council in 2022 reported that the industry was embarking on a three-year study looking at the causes and how to prevent container damage and loss. Initial results from the WSC-led research had already identified that parametric rolling in following seas as especially hazardous for container vessels. They said that this phenomenon is not well known and can develop unexpectedly with severe consequences. WSC had already supported the industry with new warnings and advisories to marines on steps to recognize and prevent parametric rolling in following seas. The system developed by Hyundai and tested on an Eastern Pacific 15,100 TEU containership in September 2022 evaluates the stability of the roll motion of the containership in operation. The solution considers various loading conditions and sea conditions and provides operation guidance on board based on actual operational information in connection with Hyundai Global Service (HGS)'s Integrated Smartship Solution (ISS). With the development of the technology, our clients are able to reduce unnecessary costs due to the loss of containers and HHI has come to secure differentiated competitiveness as a shipbuilder that ensures safe operation at sea, said Seungho Jeon, Chief Technology Officer for Hyundai Heavy Industries. It also has a significant meaning in that we have established a foundation for further advancing the system by completing a pilot test on the EPS vessels in operation. Lloyd's Register participating in the project also suggested rules, requirements, and guidance for the system as part of the AiP. This software is a crucial tool in preventing Parametric Rolling Movement and improving safety at sea, Nick Gross, Global Containership Segment Director for Lloyd's Register. Container roll can cause a ship to dangerously roll at extreme angles, sometimes culminating in a vessel capsizing. Approval in Principle for HHI's Onboard Guidance System is a meaningful milestone for preventing container roll at sea. LR reports that it is building on its long-standing relationship with HD Hyundai. Among other recent projects, they also recently awarded AiP for two containerships equipped with various measures for mitigating container loss at sea.",0,,,Lloyd's Register has awarded Approval in Principle (AiP) to Hyundai's new Onboard Guidance System.

About 700 demonstrators massed outside the Athens headquarters of Greek rail operator Hellenic Train to voice outrage and sorrow over the country's worst-ever rail disaster. Announcing the 24-hour shutdown, the rail union federation denounced a lack of respect towards Greece's rail network by successive governments over the years, which led to this tragic result. Government spokesman Yiannis Economou said an inquiry would examine the chronic delays in implementing railway works, delays caused by chronic public-sector malaise and decades of failure. - Negligence - Authorities have pointed to human error in explaining the collision in which two carriages were demolished and a restaurant car caught fire, trapping many victims inside. I believe the responsibility, the negligence, the error has been confessed by the station master, Economou told reporters in Athens. The manager acknowledges what he has done, his lawyer confirmed. Train unionists say security problems for the Athens-Thessaloniki railway line had been known for years. The country's transport minister resigned Wednesday, and his replacement on Thursday offered his apologies to families of the victims and vowed a complete evaluation of the political system and the state. I want to say, looking these people straight in the eye, that there will be an inquiry and everything will be presented to Greek citizens, Giorgos Gerapetritis said. Safety systems on the Athens-Thessaloniki line are still not fully automated, five years after the state-owned Greek rail operator Trainose was privatised and sold to Italy's Ferrovie Dello Stato Italiane and became Hellenic Train. Newspaper front pages also played up the alleged shortcomings, with the headline of Kathimerini saying The dead want answers. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after visiting the crash site Wednesday that Everything shows that the drama was, sadly, mainly due to a tragic human error. Angry demonstrators had rallied outside the Athens office of Hellenic Train on Wednesday evening, as police used tear gas to disperse protesters who threw rocks at the building. US President Joe Biden offered his condolences on Thursday for the tragic train accident, adding that We wish those injured a quick and full recovery. - 'Crumpled like paper' - Survivors described scenes of horror and chaos from the crash, many dodging smashed glass and debris as the train keeled over, and breaking windows to climb out. The train's restaurant car erupted in flames after the collision, with temperatures inside reaching 1,300 degrees Celsius (2,370 Fahrenheit), the fire department said. For hours after the crash it was not immediately clear how many people were on board, complicating efforts to determine how many are missing. Roubini Leontari, the chief coroner at Larissa's general hospital, told state broadcaster ERT on Thursday that over 10 people were still unaccounted for, including two Cyprus nationals.",1,,,"About 700 demonstrators massed outside the Athens headquarters of Greek rail operator Hellenic Train to voice outrage and sorrow over the country's worst-ever rail disaster.

The Labour Court in Johannesburg upheld an interdict to stop a strike by National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) strike on Monday evening. The union had appealed against the interdict first filed on Saturday. Nehawu kicked off a countrywide strike early on Monday with reports of intimidation stopping health workers from entering or leaving health facilities, cancelled surgeries and ambulances barred from entering or leaving hospitals, with many other critical services grinding to a halt. Read more in Daily Maverick: Wage strike hammers health services across the country The judgment states the strike will likely because irreparable harm to the government and affect numerous public services including education, health, police, home affairs, social development and correctional services. The applicant submitted that the appeal has no prospects of success given that the collective agreement that the union seeks to compel the applicant to conclude would be contrary to regulated measures in the form of Public Service Regulations. The Department of Public Service and Administration and its Minister argued that the fiscal year had not begun and the unions, therefore, did not know the financial allocations and could not yet make demands. Nehawu's KwaZulu-Natal branch closed 80 health facilities around the province, according to the union's provincial secretary Ayanda Blessing Zulu. Daily Maverick has not been able to corroborate Zulu's claim. The head offices of education, public works and cooperative governance were closed. Water and sanitation offices; sports, arts and culture were closed; social development were also closed. The strike is indefinite until our demands are met, Zulu said. Patients at Pietermaritzburg's East Boom Community Health Centre were not able to access the facility. Burning tyres and litter blocked the entrance to Umgeni Hospital in Howick. Patients visiting the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha and Mthatha General Hospital to receive critical - and at times overdue - treatment from their doctors were angry on Monday after being told to make a new appointment for another day. Wheelchair-bound Mzikayise Mabhongo, from Upper Xhongorha, was among those who were left frustrated on Monday afternoon when they were turned away at the gate. I arrived here in the morning today for a review and as you can see I am using a wheelchair. It was a hectic day. After meeting with my doctor I was told to collect medication, but the medication room was locked due to the strike. I did not receive any treatment today; it was just a waste of time and my money, Mabhongo said. Another patient Masibe Mangiso, who also uses a wheelchair, said he was told to make another appointment for next Monday because of the strike. We are patients here and they are supposed to assist us. I am hiring a bakkie for R300 to get from Qunu Village to here. Today we feel neglected as patients. Government needs to take this seriously. People are going to lose their lives, he said. Meanwhile, Monwabisi Mesilani, who was accompanying his wife, Nombulelo Qhinga, said he was angry at how they were treated on Monday. We are coming from Mqanduli with R45 each in a taxi. Just imagine coming here for nothing. It is really painful, and I do not know what will happen to my wife overnight; she did not get any assistance today, Mesilani said. Emergency medical services elsewhere in the Eastern Cape were heavily affected. Several hospitals and clinics offered only limited services and many patients wanting to collect medication were turned away. The dispatch of ambulances from the control room at Dora Nginza Hospital in Nelson Mandela Bay was interrupted after control room staff were removed from their workstations. Livingstone Hospital in Gqeberha stopped all elective surgeries and performed emergency surgery only. Protesters shut the gates to both Livingstone and Dora Nginza hospitals for a while, but they were later reopened. Protesters burnt tyres on the road in Zwide leading to Dora Nginza Hospital, which is the centre for maternal and paediatric care in the metro. Health officials said they were unsure if tyres burning in the road in front of the hospital were related to the Nehawu strike. Just before noon, a memorandum was sent from the head of the Eastern Cape health department, Dr Rolene Wagner, giving protesters two hours to return to work, saying that the principle of no work, no pay would apply. Provincial health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said four other unions were not joining the strike. He added that law enforcement agencies were deployed to deal with acts of criminality. Nehawu workers stopped people from entering health facilities and caused disruptions, according to Tebogo Lekgethwane, media and communications manager for the North West health department. Strikers barricaded entrances mainly around the Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp and several district hospitals such as Gelukspan District Hospital, he said. Most health facilities in the province were affected by the strike, Lekgethwane said, but some services returned in the afternoon when the police were called in. On Monday night, a doctor at Tshepong Hospital said no nurses had been allowed in by 8pm, patients had not received their medication and were unlikely to be served dinner. The strike is still ongoing, the doctor said. Strikers allowed a few doctors in, but no nurses. Doctors cannot provide meds, feed patients and ensure observation is being done as well as the turning of very ill patients. So right now patients and doctors are helpless, he said. He said they had information that the hospital management was meeting with the provincial health department but had not received an update. Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela has reportedly been closed, while Ermelo Regional Hospital in Ermelo is partially functional. The Free State health department's spokesperson, Mondli Mvambihave, said the department had received information that members of Nehawu had barricaded access and disrupted services at the Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Regional Hospital and Elizabeth Ross in Qwaqwa, Fezi Ngubentombi in Sasolburg, Boitumelo Hospital in Kroonstad and Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein. He said the department had contacted law enforcement agencies to ensure patients' constitutional right to health was not infringed by those participating in the strike. It is unclear so far as to who is actively participating in the strike as services have not ground to a complete halt, he said. Health workers confirmed to Daily Maverick earlier on Monday that Pelonomi and Universitas hospitals had been affected, with protesters blocking the entrances to both, resulting in surgery being cancelled. In many cases patients had been waiting months for critical surgery, a doctor confirmed. No nursing or support staff were allowed to enter Pelonomi to work. The protesters were incredibly militant and aggressive, burning tyres and throwing rocks at vehicles, said a health worker. The gates at Leratong Hospital in Krugersdorp reportedly closed at about 4am, preventing anybody from entering or leaving the hospital. A skeleton staff ventilated patients in the wards. Staff working the night shift at the hospital were met with burning tyres blocking movement in and out of the hospital. Patients seeking help at Carletonville Hospital were sent home. The hospital issued a statement on its Facebook page, urging patients and visitors to exercise caution when accessing the facility, and said it was working on mitigating any risk related to service delivery disruption as a result of the national strike. We remain open for emergency cases and EMS will continue to service critical cases, the statement added. Thelle Mogoerane Regional Hospital in Vosloorus, Helen Joseph Hospital in Auckland Park, Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, and Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital in Krugersdorp were reportedly also affected. The entrances to Helen Joseph Hospital and Chris Hani Baragwanath were blocked with burning tyres. Affected Gauteng facilities also include Bheki Mlangeni District Hospital, Thelle Mogoerane Regional Hospital, Tembisa Provincial Tertiary Hospital, Goba Clinic, Magagula Clinic, in Ekurhuleni, Kopanong Hospital, Sebokeng Regional Hospital, Heidelberg District Hospital, Johan Heyns Community Health Centre, Levai Mbatha Community Health Centre, Sebokeng Zone 17 Clinic in Sedibeng and West Rand District Hospital.

Here is what we learned from testimony,"HALIFAX -- Just shy of three years after the worst mass shooting in Canadian history, the Mass Casualty Commission inquiry will release its final report Thursday on what happened before, during and after the horrific 13 hours in April 2020, when a gunman killed 22 people, burned homes and terrorized much of northern Nova Scotia. The report -- 3,000 pages in seven volumes -- brings to a close the MCC's two-and-a-half-year, 20-million-plus probe into not only what happened, but why it happened and how to prevent it happening again. On April 18 and 19, Gabriel Wortman, a 51-year-old denturist, went on a shooting rampage dressed in an RCMP uniform and in a replica RCMP car, killing 22 people, including a pregnant woman, beginning in Portapique and ending almost 100 kilometres away in Enfield, when police caught up with him and shot him. It is a 13-hour period that traumatized a province and forever changed the lives of scores of his victims' family members and survivors. The inquiry into that shooting raised questions about RCMP response, procedures and attitudes toward victims and the public, how we as a society treat domestic violence and even about how to conduct future similar inquiries. Here are some of the things we learned during the inquiry that followed. The evening that ended in bloodshed, flames and anguish began with an anniversary celebration. The shooter and his common-law spouse, Lisa Banfield, began the evening celebrating their 19th year together with drinks in their Portapique warehouse and had a video chat with friends in the United States. At some point, that devolved into an argument, the assault and temporary imprisonment of Banfield in a replica RCMP vehicle, her subsequent escape and Wortman going on a shooting rampage in the neighbourhood, killing 13 of his neighbours and torching several of their houses along with his own. It began with the shooting of Greg Blair on the front deck of his house and his wife, Linda, as she barricaded their bedroom door with her body, trying to protect their children. The children, undetected after their mother's death, fled through the darkness to their neighbours' house, where they called 911. The Portapique shootings ended that night with the gunning down of Corrie Ellison outside the killer's burning warehouse. But questions persist over the timeline of the killer's movements. That is important, because it speaks to whether he had left Portapique before -- or very soon after -- the RCMP arrived at the scene, or whether he left later, after police presence was established. If it is the latter, it raises the question about the adequacy of RCMP containment effort -- had they managed to confine the killer to Portapique, nine lives might have been saved the following day. While there is solid evidence about the time of the death of the shooter's last victim, Corrie Ellison, there is some ambiguity in testimonies on the moments following that. One witness described seeing, at about 10:45 p.m., a car speeding up a dirt road known to locals as the blueberry field road toward Brown Loop, which connected with Highway 2 east of Portapique Beach Road. But another witness testified to having his car parked on Brown Loop during that time, and not seeing any cars, let alone a replica RCMP vehicle. After dodging the police in Portapique, the shooter spent the night in an industrial park in Debert before resuming his rampage. His first victims that day were Sean McLeod and Alanna Jenkins, 50 kilometres north in Wentworth. After killing them and setting their house afire, he killed their neighbour, Tom Bagley, as he came to help. At this point, the RCMP knew the gunman was driving a replica police car. They would been told that by witnesses the previous night and by Banfield when she emerged from hiding in the early morning. Yet it was still several hours before they told the public about it -- via Twitter at 10:17 a.m. In the interim, the shooter randomly killed three more people -- including the pregnant Kristen Beaton -- at the side of the road. Her widower, Nick Beaton, has said that if he had the information the police did about the replica car, he would not have let his wife go out that day. That replica police car also played a part in the non-fatal shooting of RCMP Const. Chad Morrison -- who thought he was meeting Const. Heidi Stevenson -- and the fatal shootings of both Stevenson and bystander Joey Webber. There was one more victim -- Gina Goulet -- a denturist known to both the shooter and Banfield. Oddly, on an anniversary drive the previous day, before the shooting started, Wortman had pointed out Goulet's house to Banfield. Forensic evidence suggests the killer shot Goulet nine times before stealing her car and leaving. It would prove to be his undoing -- there was little fuel in the car. He was spotted by police at a gas station in Enfield moments later and shot and killed. The delay in warning the public and the inefficient means of doing so -- via Twitter rather than using the province's emergency alert system -- was one of the most dissected issues as the inquiry ran its course. The RCMP has since made changes in its protocol regarding the use of the province's emergency alert system. It now sends alerts on a regular basis. In the heat of the manhunt for the killer on April 19, Const. Terry Brown and Const. Dave Melanson opened fire on a colleague sitting in his police car and an RCMP civilian liaison officer outside the Onslow fire hall, about eight kilometres west of Truro. Neither the officer, Const. Dave Gagnon, nor Emergency Management Co-ordinator Dave Westlake was injured, but the hail of bullets ripping into the fire hall caused 43,000 in damage and traumatized Chief Greg Muise and Deputy Fire Chief Darrell Currie, who were inside, along with Richard Ellison, whose son Corrie, had been killed the night before in Portapique. Melanson and Brown opened fire despite having the information on the call sign and the distinctive push bumper of the gunman's replica car and despite Gagnon's car being positioned in such a way that both were viewable. Nova Scotia's independent watchdog later decided that no charges were warranted against either officer. Possibly the most anticipated testimony at the inquiry was that of the killer's common-law spouse. When it came, it was not without controversy. Though she had spoken with police four times in the aftermath of the mass shooting, Banfield, who had been charged by police with providing ammunition to the killer, refused -- through her lawyer -- to testify at the inquiry unless those charges went away. When they did, when she testified at the inquiry, it was with a caveat -- she would only speak to the MCC counsel and would not be cross-examined by lawyers representing the families of the victims. At that point in the inquiry, that state of affairs was not unusual -- several RCMP officers had availed themselves of the same caveat, ostensibly to prevent them from being further traumatized. But in all cases, the lack of independent cross-examination frustrated the victims' families and created the perception that truth that was being revealed might not have been the full and complete truth, said lawyers for those families. In Banfield's case, the situation was most critical. Because the YOU.S. friends they were speaking to on the night of April 18 were not called to testify, Banfield was the sole witness to the beginning of the mass killing and the only person who could possibly answer the question: Why? And though her testimony touched on the gunman's anger issues, his pattern of domestic violence and of the events of that first night, the families of the victims had questions about gaps in her story that were not filled by the commission counsel -- how she managed to escape the back of the police car the gunman trapped her in, and how she managed a subfreezing night in the woods after throwing away her coat in her escape, for example. Further details on the gunman began to emerge as the inquiry progressed. Although many who met him portrayed him as pleasant and affable, he had a long history of domestic violence that dated back to nearly the beginning of his relationship with Banfield. Neighbours and police were aware of it, and it was reported to police, but the RCMP took no firm action. He also had a violent streak -- enough so that those around him, including Banfield, feared the repercussions of involving the police. Wortman's cousin -- himself an ex-RCMP officer -- told RCMP after the fact that Wortman put himself through university by smuggling alcohol and tobacco across the border in Houlton, Maine. He described Wortman to police as almost a career criminal. The cousin said he decided, as a police officer, that he had to keep his distance from Wortman. That same cousin also confirmed a report of Wortman brutally beating his own father during a family trip to the Dominican Republic in 2016. It was also known that he had a collection of guns, some of which he would smuggled in from the YOU.S. That too was reported to police but no action was taken. Many early initial questions for the RCMP revolved around when and how it discovered that the killer was dressed in one of their uniforms and driving a replica police car, why the Mounties waited several hours to inform the public of this and why, when they eventually did so, they spurned the use of the province's emergency alert system in favour of social media. (They have since adapted their protocol for the use of the emergency alert system.) But as the inquiry progressed, more questions arose about the police initial response to the reports of shooting in Portapique. Why was the gunman allowed to escape Portapique -- apparently on a dirt road that police did not know about -- that night? Why did the RCMP seem to have inadequate mapping of the area and apparently no one with first-hand knowledge? Why were containment efforts concentrated to the west of Portapique and none to the east in the directions the killer eventually escaped? In their initial response to 911 calls about the shooting, Staff Sgt. Brian Rehill, the officer in charge, sent three RCMP officers -- forming an Immediate Action Rapid Deployment (IARD) team -- into Portapique to hunt for the gunman. When reinforcements arrived later, Sgt. Andy O'Brien told the new arrivals to stay put at the head of Portapique Beach Road, fearing that in the dark officers might shoot at each other. It was more than 90 minutes before any other RCMP officers joined the initial IARD team searching Portapique for the man who killed 13 people there that night. In fact, the RCMP had the means to track each of their officers that night, by way of a GPS system incorporated into their hand-held radios. But that system had not been activated, and the IARD team members themselves were not even aware it existed. Within its ranks, the RCMP also had to deal with conflict between the provincial RCMP and its federal counterparts as then-Commissioner Brenda Lucki faced allegations of interference in the mass shooting investigation by lobbying to have the details of the guns used in the shooting released. Lucki had promised the Prime Minister's Office and then Public Safety minister Bill Blair that those details would be included in an upcoming press conference and she lambasted Nova Scotia Chief Supt. Darren Campbell when he omitted them, concerned that he would compromise the investigation. At the outset, MCC commissioner Michael McDonald made it clear that the inquiry's mandate was not about assigning blame, but about understanding what happened before, during and after the mass shooting, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again. He also said the inquiry would be taking a trauma-informed approach, to minimize the risk of re-traumatizing those who had been already affected by their connections to the mass shooting. But as the inquiry progressed, eyebrows were raised as on a near-weekly basis lawyers for the RCMP and the Department of Justice used that approach as the basis for arguments that police officers should a) not testify before the inquiry at all, b) testify before the inquiry by remote video conference, or c) testify before the commission counsel but not be subject to cross examination by independent counsel. Disingenuous or not, to some observers, that behaviour skewed the balance between trauma sensitivity and the need to get the truth. And in doing so, exacerbated trust issues, both between the public and the RCMP, and between public and the inquiry itself.",0,,,"The Mass Casualty Commission inquiry will release its final report Thursday. Gabriel Wortman went on a shooting rampage dressed in an RCMP uniform and in a replica RCMP car. He killed 22 people, including a pregnant woman, beginning in Portapique and ending in Enfield. It is a 13-hour period that traumatized a province and forever changed the lives of scores of victims' family members and survivors. The inquiry raised questions about RCMP response, procedures and attitudes toward victims and the public."

Many had been lying empty for years and had become a blot on the landscape for local people and tourists alike. So almost six years later, we decided to take a look at what has happened to them all. Surprisingly progress has only been made on a small number out of the eight, although the others have all featured in plans that have come to nothing so far. Here, we take a look at the sites - including the Assembly Rooms, in the Market Place; the former Hippodrome Theatre, in Green Lane; and derelict Duckworth Square - and ask what has happened since 2017? 1) Assembly Rooms, Derby Market Place When we first did the article in 2017, the Assembly Rooms had been standing unused for three years, exactly as it was on the night that fire broke out in the adjacent car park on March 14, 2014, and it had never re-opened. Grandiose plans were put forward in 2016 to knock down the Assembly Rooms and replace it with a state-of-the-art building which would cost up to 70m. Some funding was forthcoming from D2N2 but it came to nothing because a change of council control in 2018 led to plans for the building to remain and be refurbished instead. This was fine until structural problems led to the cost increasing from an estimated 10 million to 30 million. Shortly after this, it was decided to build a 45 million performance venue in the Becketwell area of the city. Land acquisition and demolition have taken place to prepare for this and work is due to get underway soon with a completion date in 2025. In the meantime, the Brutalist-style Assembly Rooms is still empty and derelict in the Market Place with the threat of demolition hanging over it. Despite petitions and appeals from supporters of the building, the city's planning and control committee approved its demolition providing an alternative plan for something to replace it is approved by 2026 - five years after planning permission for demolition was given. To date, it has been suggested that a replacement Derby Theatre is built in the Market place on the Assembly Rooms site but with only 20 million in the kitty for a project likely to costs at least 60 million, it looks as if the conclusion to the Assembly Rooms saga could still be some time away, especially as experts have suggested that the present theatre should not move from the Derbion centre until a plan for homes is approved. 2) Former Hippodrome Theatre, Green Lane The Grade-II listed building, in Green Lane, remains unchanged, unused and at risk, at least according to the Theatres Trust. In the past couple of years, some things have happened including some grant funding to carry out initial exploratory work by the Derby Hippodrome Restoration Trust. There have also been initial steps to bring a new live music venue to the city centre by an inaugural gathering of some of the area's promoters, musicians and festival organisers. Consultant's advice was to get young people involved from the very start to ensure they are fully engaged in the civic and cultural life of the city. At the same time, acknowledging there is plenty of work to do to restore the dilapidated and arson-hit theatre, the meeting was intended to explore what could take place there once the job of putting the 3D jigsaw together was complete. The building which is now owned by Planet International, has been deteriorating slowly over the past 10 years and a serious fire in 2015 led many people to believe it did not have a future. Proposed development of the Hippodrome Theatre could begin with phase one focusing on creating offices, workshops, a caf, and outdoor areas with temporary facilities as pop-ups. It could then progress to phase two providing space for a permanent music venue, possibly including a nightclub or other live music provision in the basement with up to a 500-audience capacity. If developed together, it is estimated that construction costs would be around 6.5 million and a total project cost of 8 million excluding site acquisition. A longer-term plan would involve a third phase, which could be the creation of an additional music venue with a capacity of 1,000 - which at first would be likely to be programmed three or four times a week to meet current market demand. 3) Former DRI site in London Road In 2017, councillors had deferred making a decision on plans for a new 500-home neighbourhood on the former Derbyshire Royal Infirmary site. As well as homes and a park, other proposed uses on the 18.5-acre site, part of the city's Nightingale Quarter, included commercial, leisure, retail and food and drink. Since then work on the 150 million city centre development on the former Derbyshire Royal Infirmary site, off London Road, is continuing to progress after getting underway in 2020. The 18.5-acre site is being transformed into new homes by property developers Wavensmere Homes. The former infirmary's pepper pot buildings are being retained for community use, with residents having access to numerous facilities, including a caf, exhibition space and meeting rooms. Other facilities include cycle paths, an outdoor gym and a children's play area, as well as six acres of green open space. 4) Former Smith Clockworks, 27-28 Queen Street Nothing concrete has happened to ensure this building continues for generations to come. Rebuilt by celebrated scientist John Whitehurst in 1764 using designs from architect Joseph Pickford, it became home to Derby's most famous artist, Joseph Wright, in 1793. In 1865, local clockmaker John Smith moved his business into the building. Smith's Clocks moved out in 1999 and it was transferred to the current owner, Joseph DeWinter. Despite its great history, the building is derelict and has been home to squatters. In autumn 2015, it was put on the market for 750,000 but it is believed to be worth much more. More recently, Derby Civic Society has announced it will once again try to have the building listed in order to prevent its possible demolition. 5) Friar Gate Goods Yard, Derby The size of eight football pitches, this site has been derelict for over 50 years. It was once part of the Great Northern Railway and included Friar Gate station. Services stopped operating from the station in 1963 and from the goods yard in 1968. Historic buildings on the site include a now-roofless bonded warehouse and 10 railway arches attached to Friar Gate Bridge. Planning permission was granted to Clowes - the site's owner for the past 30 years - in October 2011 for homes, offices, cafes and shops, while turning the Grade II-listed warehouse into a supermarket. But a downturn in the fortune of supermarkets put paid to the latter idea. The owners have said a high-value use for the warehouse, such as retail, bars and restaurants, was still needed to make restoring it affordable. More recently, at the beginning of this year, it was revealed that fresh plans have been revealed for the site, off Stafford Street, which could see the former bonded warehouse and the engine house saved and restored as part of a new multi-million-pound development that would transform the city. Details were in a report sent to Derby City Council planners. The document reveals plans to build up to 300 homes on the site, predominantly comprising houses, with some apartments also planned. The developer also intends to restore the bonded warehouse and the engine house on the site for shops, restaurants, cafs and offices. 6) Friar Gate Bridge, Derby Another eyesore where nothing has happened. The ornate bridge, constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co, was part of the western extension of the Great Northern Railway and opened in 1878. When the line closed in 1967, the Grade II-listed structure began to deteriorate. It was sold by British Rail to the city council for 1 on the understanding it would be looked after by the authority. The Friends of Friar Gate Bridge was formed with the goal of fully restoring the structure, which has been described as in a disgraceful state by Derby Civic Society. It was said in 2022 that it was hoped that Friar Gate Bridge can be renovated under the same scheme as Friar Gate Goods Yard above but so far no detailed plans have been revealed. 7) Debenhams, Victoria Street In 2017, Derby's former Debenhams building was put up for sale by the city council in June, after obtaining it from the previous owners, Intu. It was demolished in 2020 and the site has been used for the building of two large apartment blocks containing 259 flats, the first of which will be occupied in the next couple of weeks, as part of the Becketwell development. 8) Duckworth Square, Derby In 2017, one of Derby's biggest eyesores was set to become a 10 million ice rink by 2020. But the idea was thrown out with a change of council in 2018 and now the area is shaping up as part of the Becketwell development with the construction of a public square adjacent to the two large apartment blocks above on the former Debenhams site. The 200 million makeover of Becketwell will see a public square built as well as a 3,500-capacity performance venue. We send the biggest stories out every day as part of our newsletter.

That pastoral landscape now looks more like the Pacific Ocean in many areas. Months of atmospheric river storms have pummeled the area and saturated the basin's soil, which sits about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, not far from Fresno. The rains have led to floods that damaged towns and deluged farms and have begun to refill what was once a sprawling lake.

High-stakes decisions over where that water travels could resonate across the country's grocery store shelves. In the farming communities that dot the historic lake bed, accusations of sabotaged levees, frantic efforts to patch breached banks and feuds -- common occurrences during flood fights in the area -- have started already, said Matt Hurley, a former water manager for several water districts in the Tulare Basin.",1,,," months of atmospheric river storms have pummeled California's Tulare Basin.

It is heartbreaking, Londoo, 26, said. People should be able to make those decisions when they are ready and not because they are forced into certain situations. Latinas and Black women working to keep abortions accessible in Florida worry the new law will result in more people of color being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term -- which often result in worse economic and mental health outcomes. While reproductive age women of all races and ethnicities are at risk of unintended pregnancy, Hispanic and Black women face a disproportionally higher risk, according to research published in 2020 in the peer-reviewed journal Contraception and Reproductive Medicine. The conditions of our state, people not being able to afford abortion care, these are going to keep people pregnant against their will, ultimately, Florida Access Network co-executive director Stephanie Loraine Pieiro, who heads the only abortion fund led by queer people of color in the state, said. The law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday night will take effect only if Florida's current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court. Bienvenido US, a Hispanic conservative national group, celebrated the news on Friday calling it A PRO LIFE VICTORY! on Twitter. The Radiance Foundation, a faith-based nonprofit group founded by African-American pro-life activist Ryan Bomberger, shared a post on Facebook celebrating the abortion ban saying, We will not stop this humanrights fight until every life is protected from the violence of abortion and the predators who profit from fear and pain. Florida is home to 828,100 Black women of reproductive age. Among the 1.4 million Latinas of reproductive age, 570,000 are economically insecure and 585,200 are already mothers, according to a November report. For Black and brown people in the state, giving birth can present an additional set of dangers and concerns given its high rates of maternal mortality. Some also face systemic barriers such as lack of heath insurance, health care literacy and access to culturally and linguistically competent health systems, as well as discriminatory policies that make it difficult for people to access routine health care, Aurelie Coln-Larrauri, the Florida state policy advocate for the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said. Forcing anyone in marginalized communities to continue their pregnancy, because they cannot terminate them, may actually contribute to an increase of maternal mortality rates in the state of Florida, Coln-Larrauri said. Coln-Larrauri and Piero worry about how many people will forego abortion care because they cannot travel or afford the procedure. This six week abortion ban is effectively a total ban, Piero said, adding that it is often not enough time for people to find out they are pregnant, figure out how to pay for the procedure, secure traveling and lodging logistics, and in some cases child care. It is not realistic, and that is by design, she added. A recent Turnaway Study from demographer Diana Greene Foster, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco, found that women who had been denied abortion access experienced worse economic and mental health outcomes than women who had received care and that 95 of study participants who received abortions said they made the right decision. The new Florida law contains some exceptions, including to save the woman's life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation like a restraining order or police report. In the work Jamarah Amani as done as the executive director of the Southern Birth Justice Network and member of the coalition Black in Repro, she has witnessed how these exceptions do not actually play out in the way that we think they will. She has seen it with the 15-week abortion ban currently in place. There have been situations where people have had to go to other states, or they have had to carry pregnancies against their will, because they did not have proper documentation, Amani, who is also a midwife, said. In cases where the woman's life is at risk, Amani worries about doctors waiting too long to act on behalf of their pregnant patients because it is not always clear how at-risk should patients need to be in order for doctors to avoid litigation, criminal penalties or even losing their licenses. These further restrictions placed on abortion care, make a medically safe practice legally dangerous, and endangers the lives in the process, Coln-Larrauri said. The bill also includes 25 million to expand Florida Pregnancy Care Network Inc., a statewide network of nonprofit groups that provides services by often subcontracting crisis pregnancy centers, which are known to provide inaccurate or misleading information about abortions to pregnant people. What we need is investments in legitimate health care, Amani said, and abortion funds to help people get those early abortions, which will hopefully still be legal. As advocates wait for a Florida court to determine the fate of the new abortion ban, the Florida Access Network will continue debunking the rising abortion misinformation that often follows when a new law is passed and ramp up fundraising efforts to be ready for an increase in patients that may need to travel outside of Florida to get the procedure, Pieiro said. After Texas passed its six-week abortion law months ago, many independent abortion clinics shut down or ended up drastically increasing their prices. Pieiro fears the same will happen in Florida. The abortion care people will need is getting appointments and tangibly helping them pay for travel, Pieiro said. As a mother raising Black children, Amani worries about how these laws are reviving a painful legacy in which our ancestors were forced to breed and not being able to decide anything about their bodies. It is just crazy that in 2023, I am handing that world, again, to my children, she said. It is a matter of life and death, and we want our lives. People that are in power should not be able to make death sentence decisions for any group of people, Amani added. Londoo agrees. People should be able to decide when and if to start a family -- on their own time, when they are ready, and under their own circumstances, she said.",0,,,"Latinas and Black women working to keep abortions accessible in Florida worry the new law will result in more people of color being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. The law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday night will take effect only if Florida's current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge. The Radiance Foundation, a faith-based nonprofit group founded by African-American pro-life activist Ryan Bomberger, shared a post on Facebook celebrating the abortion ban."

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. Tens of thousands of junior doctors went on strike across England on Monday to demand better pay, kicking off three days of widespread disruption at the YOU.K.'s state-funded hospitals and health clinics. Junior doctors -- who are qualified but in the earlier years of their career -- make up 45 of all doctors in the National Health Service. Their walkout means that operations and appointments will be canceled for thousands of patients, and senior doctors and other medics have had to be drafted in to cover for emergency services, critical care and maternity services. The British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, says pay for junior doctors has fallen 26 in real terms since 2008, while workload and patient waiting lists are at record highs. The union says burnout and the YOU.K.'s cost-of-living crisis are driving scores of doctors away from the public health service. TRAINS CANCELED, SCHOOLS CLOSED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AFTER BLIZZARD, HEAVY WINDS HIT THE COUNTRY The union said newly qualified medics earn just 17 an hour. All that junior doctors are asking is to be paid a wage that matches our skill set, said Rebecca Lissman, 29, a trainee in obstetrics and gynaecology. We love the NHS, and I do not want to work in private practice, but I think we are seeing the erosion of public services. I want to be in work, looking after people, getting trained. I do not want to be out here striking, but I feel that I have to, she added. Other health workers, including nurses and paramedics, have also staged strikes in recent months to demand better pay and conditions. NHS figures show that more than 100,000 appointments have already been postponed this winter as a result of the nurses' walkouts. Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said the 72-hour strike this week is expected to have the most serious impact and will cause extensive disruption. He said some cancer care will likely be affected, alongside routine appointments and some operations. UK SCHOOL BLASTED FOR REPLACING GIRLS' BATHROOM MIRRORS WITH 'PROVOCATIVE' POSTERS: 'VERY MEDIEVAL' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters on Sunday it was disappointing that the junior doctors' union are not engaging with the government. The doctors' union said officials have refused to engage with their demands for months, and that a recent invitation to talks came with unacceptable preconditions. The doctors' strike this week will coincide with mass walkouts by tens of thousands of teachers and civil servants on Wednesday, the day the government unveils its latest budget statement. A wave of strikes has disrupted Britons' lives for months, as workers demand pay raises to keep pace with soaring inflation, which stood at 10.1 in January. That was down from a November peak of 11.1, but is still the highest in 40 years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Scores of others in the public sector, including train drivers, airport baggage handlers, border staff, driving examiners, bus drivers and postal workers have all walked off their jobs to demand higher pay. Unions say wages, especially in the public sector, have fallen in real terms over the past decade, and a cost-of-living crisis fueled by sharply rising food and energy prices has left many struggling to pay their bills.",0,,,"Tens of thousands of junior doctors went on strike across England on Monday to demand better pay.

The SCFI came in at 1033.65 points on Friday, up 8 week on week (ww). The China-YOU.S. West Coast route, which comprises 20 of the index weighting, jumped 29 ww, to 1,668 per forty-foot equivalent unit. Freight rates have rebounded strongly on the back of the mid-April GRI general rate increase, due mainly to rate increases on the trans-Pacific, Middle East and Latin American routes, said Linerlytica on Monday. The SCFI, which specifically measures cargo flows from China, is now up 14 from the cycle low of 906.55 points in the week ending March 10. The index suffered its steepest losses last September. Weekly declines this year (before the recent turnaround) have been muted. The various spot indexes do not paint a clear picture, however. They show a plateau at very low rate levels and no direction yet. The Drewry World Container Index (WCI) global composite was flat ww for the week ending Thursday. Unlike the SCFI, the WCI showed Shanghai-Los Angeles spot rates down 4 ww, to 1,674 per FEU. The Freightos Baltic Daily Index (FBX) global composite, as of Friday, was down 2 ww. The FBX China-West Coast assessment was flat ww, at 1,005 per FEU. Platts' North Asia-West Coast North America spot-rate assessment was up 19 ww, to 1,250 per FEU, mirroring the trend seen in the SCFI. In contrast, Xeneta's XSI-C short-term rate index for the Far East to the West Coast was essentially flat ww (down 0.5) at 1,151 per FEU on Friday. Talk of a spot-rate floor raises two big questions when considering the broader outlook for liner earnings: What about contract rates, which are more important than spot rates, with trans-Pacific annual contracts for May 2023-April 2024 about to debut? And what about the massive wave of newbuildings that began hitting the market in March, a deluge of new tonnage that will continue through at least 2025? For context on talk of a market bottom, FreightWaves interviewed Omar Nokta, shipping analyst at Jefferies. Up until recently, you could almost characterize the spot market as 'no bid,' Nokta said on Monday. No matter how much capacity was taken offline, spot freight rates were just not budging. But these GRIs they have just put in look a bit stickier. Zim NYSE: ZIM continues to be the most talked-about stock in my coverage universe, said Nokta, who covers a wide range of shipping equities from tankers to dry bulk to container shipping. With around 90 million in Zim shares bought and sold each day, it is very actively traded, he said. Zim's heavy focus on the Asia-YOU.S. market (mainly to the East Coast) and its high spot exposure make it the go-to name -- it is probably the best way in Western markets to express a view on freight rates. That is one reason why there have been a lot of bets put on it recently. Zim's stock, as with other container shipping stocks, fell hard since the boom-time peak. It is down 70 from its 52-week high. But it closed Monday up 24 from April 6. Nokta said of the liner market in general: It has been so ugly that investors generally think this is as bad as it gets and the bottom we have seen is probably too extreme, because it is destocking of inventories and not reflective of actual demand. And the moment the destock is over you are going to have more activity and that is going to come up against a trans-Pacific market with 20-30 of its capacity removed. Investors are thinking, The industry could have issues over the next two years as new ships deliver, but in the near term, what is going to drive the shares is the end of the destock and beginning of the restock. Shares of container lines like Zim and container-ship lessors like Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL) rose with rate momentum during the boom and fell when rates collapsed from the peak. One of the pitches for container shipping stocks more recently relates to value: that stock prices overshot to the downside and do not reflect the current value of the companies. The value thesis has been easier on the ship-lessor side because there is asset value and there is visibility, said Nokta. For the lessors -- the companies that provide leased tonnage to the liner companies -- both time-charter rates and container-ship asset values have risen off their lows. The Harpex index, which measures global time-charter rates, has been on the upswing since late February. Ship brokerage Braemar reported Monday that the buzz in the container ship chartering market continues and asset prices continue to have some upward momentum ... as charter periods in some sectors noticeably lengthen. According to Nokta, the value pitch on the liner side has been harder because these companies are in a net cash position and they are trading below book value so there is definitely a recognition that they are not expensive, but investors are trying to gauge: How cheap are they? How much should they be pricing in for loss-making periods? One sentiment factor in liner stocks' favor: Liner companies are not behaving in any way like their industry is facing imminent disaster, despite loss-making freight rates and a record-high newbuilding orderbook. From the outside looking in, you would say: They have all paid out monster dividends. They are continuing to order ships. They are time-chartering more vessels. Absent looking at spot rates, you would say everything is fine. But when you look at freight rates, no one is profitable on a mark-to-market basis, so what is happening? I would say liners have a history of being aware of their market's dynamics. They see the trends because they are actually living them minute by minute, Nokta told FreightWaves. They saw what was happening three years ago at the beginning of the COVID boom before a lot of us did. In other words, the liners' current actions may imply that their future prospects are not as dire as today's dismal freight rates suggest. What of the massive orderbook? I would say that a lot of these orders are orders the liners wanted to place four or five years ago but they did not have the cash flow then, said Nokta. The new ships will also be much more cost efficient, he emphasized. I think they are ordering ships in anticipation of replacing their existing portfolio. The liners can lower their unit costs and make the existing fleet more of a shipowners' lessors' problem. Both liners and the container-ship lessors entered this downturn with very strong cash positions and very good balance sheets. As a result, the liners will not have to fight for market share to the degree they did in past downturns, Nokta maintained. Liners typically own around half their fleet and charter the other half. They can take delivery of their newbuildings and let existing charters roll off to the extent necessary, leaving it to the ship lessors to figure out how they are going to redeploy those older vessels.",0,,,"Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) has just risen for the third week in a row after nine months of continuous declines.

The airport in State College, located less than five miles from the campus, was closed to air traffic and passengers while an explosives device team and local police examine the contents of the bag, which was checked on a flight en route to Chicago, Penn State University Police and Public Safety said in a statement. A suspicious looking item was detected by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers in a checked back at the airport, according to TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein. Local police officers and FBI officials are on site, she said. The immediate area was evacuated and a perimeter established. The local police and bomb technicians will be taking a closer look at the bag and its contents, Farbstein said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a ground stop for the airport due to security. As of Friday evening, there was no estimate for when the airport would reopen, police said. The airport closure took place as Penn State students were gearing up for their Spring Break travel plans next week. Buses from the university came to the airport to transport about 100 passengers to the campus, where they were offered shelter and given food, according to police.

An over-the-road tanker truck transporting LPG became overpressurized and exploded, according to officials.

There was no pollution and no hazard to shipping or to the public, ccording to the Harris County Office of Emergency Management. These incidents continue to happen too often in our community, and that is unacceptable, said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.

Grossberg, who worked as a senior producer for hosts Maria Bartiromo and Tucker Carlson, alleged in a new sworn statement obtained by NBC News that Fox lawyers ignored repeated reminders about an additional cellphone in her possession and did not search it during court-ordered discovery. In the statement, Grossberg said she repeatedly told Fox lawyers that she had an inoperable company-issued cellphone that she used during 2020 election coverage. Fox lawyers told her to hang on to the device but never searched it or copied her files, as they did with her other phones, according to the statement. Grossberg was fired in March after she filed a lawsuit claiming that Fox lawyers coerced her into giving misleading testimony in the Dominion case and that she was being made a scapegoat for the network's 2020 election coverage. Fox says she was fired for divulging privileged information. Grossberg, in the new affidavit, said a forensic expert recently pulled two recordings off the broken phone that she recorded using an app called Otter, which simultaneously records and creates text transcriptions of audio files. The recordings, which she details in the affidavit and audio of which was shared with NBC News, are of phone interviews she participated in with Bartiromo: one with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and another with two sources who claimed to know about Dominion voter fraud. She said she used Otter in the normal course of her work as a producer. Recordings are saved in the Otter app, and they can also be shared. Grossberg's attorney, Gerry Filippatos, said the statement would be filed with the Delaware court as early as Tuesday, the day the trial is set to begin. Abby Grossberg stands ready to do her part to ensure that justice is done; that those who are licensed and obligated to tell the truth, and guide others to the truth, do just that. As soon as possible and practicable, Ms. Grossberg will continue to set the record straight by telling all she knows to those who need to know, Filippatos said in a statement. In last week's pretrial court appearances, Dominion attorneys played other recordings Grossberg made as a producer, including one with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that Dominion said they would received from Fox just the previous week. That, along with confusion over News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch's current role at Fox News, appeared to frustrate Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis. Murdoch is Fox News' executive chair, too. He admonished the Fox lawyers for withholding evidence and not being straightforward with the court, and he said the company would have to foot the bill if an additional deposition was necessary. He also said he was considering appointing a special master to investigate legal misconduct by the attorneys over whether Fox misrepresented their discovery efforts. Abby Grossberg is not Dominion's problem. It is not my problem. Abby Grossberg is a Fox problem, Davis said at the hearing last week. It may not show, but I am very uncomfortable, he added. Dominion did not respond to requests for comment. FOX News has complied with its discovery obligations, a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. At last week's hearing, Fox lawyer Michael Skokna said Grossberg had not disclosed the existence of the Otter recordings. In her new statement, Grossberg said that Skokna's claim was absolutely false and that she would told Fox lawyers about Otter in August. I proactively and specifically disclosed to the Fox News attorneys that I used an app called Otter for work purposes during the relevant time period, she said, adding that a Fox attorney then asked her to explain how Otter works. In a filing dated Monday, Fox lawyers added that while they had not known of Grossberg's Otter recordings, they had shared some of Grossberg's Otter transcripts found on email. The Giuliani transcript was shared with Dominion 10 months ago, they said. Grossberg said that she recently asked a forensic expert to review the older phone and that the expert uncovered the recordings of the two interviews. Grossberg's attorney shared the audio with NBC News. The first recording, according to Grossberg's affidavit, made on November 7, 2020, was of a phone interview Bartiromo and Grossberg conducted with Cruz to discuss a planned broadcast appearance. Cruz is heard discussing voter fraud allegations -- including an irregularity in Michigan, which uses Dominion machines in most counties -- but stresses the need for facts and proof. It falls on the shoulders of the legal team that is bringing these cases to ascertain the facts. And it just cannot be, you know, someone tweeted this. It is got to be demonstrable facts that can be laid out with evidence, because that is what a court of law is going to look to. Not just an allegation, but actual facts, Cruz said on the recording. And I hope when Rudy comes on the show tomorrow, he has some of those facts. Cruz did not respond to a request for comment. Grossberg said in her affidavit that the second recording, made on November 13, 2020, was of a background interview Grossberg and Bartiromo conducted with a banker named Doug Anderson, the CEO of Wall Street Capital Partners, and a male source who was granted anonymity to participate. The men discuss conspiratorial claims about Dominion voting machines; Bartiromo promises to help expose as much as we can, while Grossberg presses for more information. Anderson did not respond to a request for comment. Grossberg said in the new statement that after she was fired last month, Fox asked her to return her ID badge and her company-issued cellphone. She said she complied but added that she forgot that she still had the older, broken device at the time. Chris Mattei, a lawyer who sued conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation on behalf of families of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, said Dominion's lawyers may well be able to capitalize on the situation. The better thing that Dominion's lawyers might think about is the extent to which they can use any evidence or cover up as affirmative evidence of something like consciousness of guilt, he said, especially if Grossberg testifies for Dominion. Dominion included Grossberg on a list of proposed witnesses filed with the court. Sometimes evidence of a cover-up or bad faith in litigation -- like that evidence itself -- a jury might find pretty compelling, he said. Grossberg has filed to intervene in the Delaware defamation case, but the judge has not yet ruled on the matter.",0,,,"Abby Grossberg says she found more evidence relevant to Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit.

Recently, a driver using ELD Rider software recorded a ghost co-driver being added to his device within 15-20 minutes after the driver contacted the company to request more hours. The truck driver requested that FreightWaves not link to the video in the article for fear that his voice or truck may be recognized by ELD Rider representatives. Instead, FreightWaves agreed to use screenshots from the video to illustrate how the ghost co-driver process is done. At the time the YOU.S. driver contacted the ELD Rider representative in Serbia, the driver, who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation, had no drive time left on his clock and only 12 hours remaining on his 70-hour cycle before he was required by federal law to take a 34-hour reset. The video, which was reviewed by FreightWaves, shows an alert being sent to the engine control module (ECM) connected to the driver's truck. The alert notified the driver that a representative was logging him off and taking over to edit his logs. He later received a call from ELD Rider confirming that the representative had edited the log to add a co-driver, often referred to as a ghost driver. The video then pans to his device, showing that he now had almost 10 hours of drive time left and around 68 hours remaining on his cycle before he must take 34 consecutive hours off duty before driving again. As of publication, LionEight LLC is listed on the FMCSA registry as the company that owns the ELD Rider software. On background, counsel representing LionEight TMS LLC, said the new entity is entirely separate from LionEight TMS, and was sold to Darex Solutions last year. The sale included all of LionEight's assets, the ELD software and accounts, the attorney added.  LionEight TMS has nothing to do with these devices. LionEight TMS continues to own the rights to the actual name LionEight. Darex is using the name 'LionEight' under the terms of a temporary license agreement it has with LionEight TMS, the attorney said. All of the businesses are listed to the same address in McCook, Illinois, including the new LionEight TMS entity, according to the Illinois secretary of state's business entity website. The attorney said LionEight TMS, which is launching a new product offering in May, has no involvement with the devices or the conduct that FreightWaves uncovered with the help of industry sources familiar with the use of ghost co-drivers. A whistleblower told FreightWaves that representatives of ELD Rider owned by LionEight have been manipulating drivers' HOS logs to cheat the system since 2019, even it LionEight LLC sold the company to Darex Solutions in December. Fleets using automatic onboard recording device systems (AOBRDS) were forced to switch to ELDs by December 2019. Some vendors developed work-arounds to attract customers who wanted to add ghost co-drivers to cheat on HOS logs. Things really got out of hand in late 2019 when AOBRDS were being phased out, an industry source, who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation, told FreightWaves. In a March 16 email to customers, LionEight LLC announced it would be changing its name to Darex Solutions, effective April 3. All of the charges from former LionEight LLC will now be reflected with the new name Darex Solutions LLC and associated with the same bank account, stated the email, which was obtained by FreightWaves. The email, signed by the Darex Solutions LLC Team, formerly LionEight LLC, stated, Additionally, there has been no change in management and in the range of products and services we offer. A source familiar with the situation independently reviewed the recording of the ELD Rider representative adding a ghost driver. The source says the video was forwarded to federal investigators a few weeks before the ELD provider announced it was changing its name. However, FMCSA did not confirm whether it had reviewed the video or was investigating claims about the ELD Rider HOS app and its alleged ghost co-driver feature. FMCSA does not comment on ongoing investigations or enforcement procedures, the regulatory agency said in an email to FreightWaves. However, each device listedregistered as an ELD must meet the minimum requirements established in 49 CFR part 395, Subpart B, Appendix A. FMCSA has a process to monitor ELD regulatory compliance, and those devices found to not meet these requirements will be removed from the ELD registration list. It appears FMCSA, which regulates the trucking industry, is ramping up enforcement to crack down on ELD providers that do not meet federal requirements. The agency has removed five devices from its registry this year, which is more than it revoked in the previous four years, with only two revocations in 2022. The FMCSA removed All-Ways Track ELD from its self-certification registry on Monday. The vendor has until May 26 to make the necessary changes before it can recertify its device. Until then, the agency is urging All-Ways' ELD customers to use paper logs while the issues are addressed. FMCSA revoked two ELD providers, TMS One's ELD One and its sister company One Plus ELD's 1 PL Logs, from its registry two months ago. Executives at the companies providing these two devices have already self-certified another HOS-tracking app, CN ELD, with FMCSA. After FMCSA revoked ELD One from its registry in January, CEO Radu Murzac acknowledged that his device was not in full compliance with the mandate. A week later, 1 PL Logs, which used the same source code as ELD One, was removed from the list of approved devices. When we first came to market, the process to become an ELD provider was relatively new, Murzac told FreightWaves. We navigated this process with the best interpretation of the law as we could. However, we have come to learn that the interpretation and logic we based a few components of our platform on was not in full compliance of the mandate. Sources familiar with ELD One and 1 PL Logs allege customers were able to use a ghost co-driver option. Murzac acknowledges that he has a team of people overseas providing customer support and monitoring services. He said there are many third-party services in the industry that he has nothing to do with that offer ghost driver services. He also said he is aware that some ELD providers cheat the system. Most, if not all, ELDs are probably subject to such manipulations, Murzac said in an email to FreightWaves. According to Illinois secretary of state business filings, a new company called ELD Connection Inc. is owned by Murzac's partner, Karina Hryhoruk. A source familiar with the new company said ELD Connection is currently moving customers over to the new CN ELD platform. In September, the FMCSA began seeking comments from the public on possible revisions to improve regulations governing the use of ELDs and to address concerns about technical specifications that have been raised by compliant ELD providers. This is good news for some ELD providers that have taken it upon themselves to police the industry. Industry insiders and safety groups are critical of FMCSA's decision to allow ELD providers to self-certify their devices instead of adopting Canada's mandate that requires independent third-party testers to vet the companies to ensure their software meets Canadian's technical requirements, which may make them less susceptible to manipulation. Independent third-party testing was not an option in the YOU.S., according to Duane DeBruyne, who served as the FMCSA's spokesman from 2005 to 2021, because Congress did not provide dedicated funding to cover the costs. FMCSA followed the model established by its sister USDOT agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has long made use of self-certification in the myriad of vehicle components it regulates, DeBruyne wrote in an email to FreightWaves. After 16 years, DeBruyne retired as FMCSA's spokesman in early January 2022. He said he is unable to authoritatively comment on the happenings over the past 15 months about why the agency failed to investigate alleged cheating by some ELD providers to skirt HOS regulations. However, he agrees that the regulatory agency appears to be ramping up enforcement to revoke fraudulent ELDs By the end of December 2021, with the number of ELD manufacturers having grown exponentially, FMCSA program staff did begin looking into possible illegal products, DeBruyne said. However, for the period covering the previous 45 months, 'self-certification' of ELDs was a 'non-issue' within the agency, he said. One source described the actions of vendors that take advantage of flaws in FMCSA's self-certification process as the untraceable, perfect crime that is taking place on the federal level at the hands of FMCSA-registered ELD providers. Numerous laws of the federal government of the United States are being broken every day, every hour and every minute by thousands of people, the unnamed source told FreightWaves. The FMCSA's goal of increasing safety on the road and in the work environment will not be achieved if some ELD providers continue to flout the law, the source said. Illegal ELD providers and the trucking companies that use their products are putting the lives and well-being of millions in grave danger, the industry source told FreightWaves. Drivers are often abused by being forced to drive without rest, and tired drivers are much more likely to cause an accident on the road. Do you have a news tip or story to share?

A bomb cyclone is wreaking havoc across an already soaked California, killing at least two people whose vehicles were crushed by falling trees in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said. A dramatic drop in atmospheric pressure triggered the so-called bomb cyclone that swept in from the Pacific Ocean and clobbered the San Francisco area. The storm packed heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 90 mph that knocked down trees, blocking major roadways and highways, officials said. Tens of thousands of utility customers lost power, according to officials. One person was killed and another was injured in the gated community of Rossmoor, about 25 miles east of San Francisco, when a tree fell on a moving car, according to the California Highway Patrol. Another motorist was killed around 1:30 p.m. local time Tuesday when a toppled tree crushed a work van in San Mateo County, about 30 miles south of San Francisco, according to CHP. The powerful springtime storm is also being blamed for the derailment of an Amtrak train near Martinez, about 35 miles east of San Francisco. The train was carrying 55 passengers when it struck a downed tree on the tracks, according to Amtrak officials. No injuries were reported. High wind gusts also caused a tractor-trailer rig to overturn on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, blocking the eastbound lanes and snarling traffic during the evening commute, according to CHP. The winds were so strong in downtown San Francisco Tuesday that it knocked out windows in high-rise buildings, sending shattered glass to the ground, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. San Francisco International Airport recorded wind gusts of 64 mph, while gusty winds reached 74 mph in Oakland. Gusts hit nearly 90 mph between San Francisco and Sacramento. The bomb cyclone developed off the coast of San Francisco Tuesday when the atmospheric pressure dropped 24 millibars in 17 hours, producing the strongest March storm ever recorded in the Bay Area. The same storm system walloped Southern California Tuesday with wind gusts of up to 100 mph in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles. The town of Lytle Creek in the San Gabriel Mountains recorded more than 6 inches of rain, while nearly an inch-and-a-half of rain fell in downtown Los Angeles. The weather system is expected to weaken Wednesday, but most of California will remain under a flood watch and high-wind alerts are expected to persist into the afternoon. The storm, the latest in a series of atmospheric river systems that has nearly eliminated the state's multi-year drought, is expected to move southeast, bringing severe weather to parts of Texas, Alabama and Oklahoma. Severe weather on Thursday and Friday could produce large hail and damaging winds from the Dallas-Fort Worth area to San Angelo, more than 250 miles southwest of Dallas. As the storm moves east on Friday, a possible tornado outbreak could form in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service.",1,,,"A dramatic drop in atmospheric pressure triggered the so-called bomb cyclone.

Following the buzzy release of Netflix's hit comedy drama Beef, one of its stars, David Choe, has drawn controversy for an incident he talked about on a podcast he was hosting in 2014. Clips of the podcast, which feature him telling a story that has been criticized as rape and sexual assault -- but that he later walked back as a fabrication on his part -- have been widely shared since Beef debuted last week. During his now-defunct podcast, DVDASA, Choe said that he performed sex acts in front of a massage therapist named Rose and forced her to do so as well after she had said no, among other instances that he labeled as rapey behavior. Choe, who plays Isaac on the Netflix show and is also known for his graffiti artistry, said during the podcast episode, viewed by NBC News, So I go back to the chill method of: You never ask first, you just do it, get in trouble and then pay the price later. Neither Choe nor Netflix responded to NBC News' request for comment. But following the controversial podcast in 2014, the artist released a statement, denying any truth to the story, saying the podcast is a complete extension of my art. I never thought I would wake up one late afternoon and hear myself called a rapist. It sucks. Especially because I am not one. I am not a rapist. I hate rapists, he wrote in the 2014 statement. Multiple news outlets reported on his response at the time, which was posted on the podcast's now-defunct website. He described the mission of the podcast at the time as, We create stories and tell tales ... It is my version of reality, it is art that sometimes offends people. I am sorry if anyone believed that the stories were fact. They were not! Many social media users are questioning his casting and pointing to specific quotes in the past clips, such as Choe saying that he is a successful rapist. At the time, the comments prompted criticisms from activists and organizations including Advancing Justice -- LA, Center for the Pacific Asian Family, and South Asian Helpline and Referral Agency, who deemed what Choe had described an instance of coercion and an example of sexual violence. Choe's story reflects the harsh reality that men and women alike continue to believe and perpetuate the dangerous myth that coerced sexual activity is not considered assault or rape. By legal definition, you are committing an act of sexual assault when you do not receive consent, the organizations wrote in a statement. Based on Choe's telling, the masseuse's repeated protests, in addition to his physical coercion, indicate that she was not consenting to the acts he requested. While Choe addressed the incident after the podcast's release, the issue came up again in 2017 after a mural he painted was vandalized. Among the messages tagged on it was the word rapist. Choe released a statement on Instagram following the incident, apologizing for the episode and writing that he has ZERO history of sexual assault. In a 2014 episode of DVDASA, I relayed a story simply for shock value that made it seem as if I had sexually violated a woman. Though I said those words, I did not commit those actions. It did not happen, he said. I am deeply sorry for any hurt I have brought to anyone through my past words. Non-consensual sex is rape and it is never funny or appropriate to joke about.",0,,,"David Choe, one of the stars of Netflix's Beef, has drawn controversy for an incident he talked about on a podcast he was hosting in 2014.

1710,02:07.9,7416718903,train,3b27edc7-6ce6-4216-bc47-5693f57b052e,,,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/train-strikes-dates-everything-know-130241721.html,Train strikes: Dates and everything you need to know ahead of next walk-outs,"Members of the RMT union working for Network Rail and 14 train operators are staging more walk-outs and overtime bans in the current round of strikes. Since June 2022, national rail strikes in a tangle of disputes about pay, job security and working arrangements have caused problems for tens of millions of train passengers. Since then, stoppages causing massive disruption for passengers have been called frequently. These are the key questions and answers. The main rail union, the RMT, has instructed all its members working for Network Rail and 14 train operators to strike on Thursday 16 March. In addition, those working for train operators will also walk out on Saturday 18 March, Thursday 30 March and Saturday 1 April. The train firms are those contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators: All the London commuter operators will also be hit: Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected: On 16 March the national strike includes workers at both Network Rail and the train operators. The intention is to knock out most services across Great Britain. Crucially, signalling staff working for Network Rail will walk out, reducing the nation's railway to a rump of some intercity lines and commuter routes. There will also be some effect on the evening of Wednesday 15 March and the morning of Friday 17 March. Thousands of trains will run, but they are likely to be limited to between 7.30am and 6.30pm because of signalling cover. The exact proportion of normal services will vary sharply from one train operator to another. Figures published by the government for the last similar strike, on 4 January, show that Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway and LNER operated between a quarter and a third of usual services. On most commuter services in the London area, the figure was around one in five. Worst performer was Northern, which operated only one in 20 of regular scheduled trains. Among train firms that are not in dispute with the RMT, the proportion of services also varies widely. In Scotland and Wales, where the national operators - ScotRail and Transport for Wales - are not involved, most trains will be cancelled. In Scotland, 19 per cent of scheduled services ran last time, while the figure for Wales was 14 per cent. Grand Central, linking London King's Cross with Yorkshire and Teesside, ran 58 per cent of its planned trains. Heathrow Express did best, with two out of three services running normally on 4 January. A similar performance is expected for 16 March. The strikes on 18 and 30 March plus 1 April will have significantly less impact, as signallers should work normally. Train operators not involved in the dispute should be able to run services as scheduled. On all but the first day of the next round of strikes - 16 March - passengers can expect normal service on: Trains run by these companies are likely to be more crowded than normal on routes usually shared with train operators whose staff are striking, such as London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh and Swansea-Cardiff-Newport. The effects of the Network Rail overtime ban are less easy to quantify. On Thursday 16 March early and late trains linking London with Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam are likely to be curtailed because of the strike by Network Rail signallers. On the remaining three days there should be no impact - but connections to and from London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three train operators (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) will walk out. Workers for both Network Rail and the train operators have been offered a minimum pay rise of 5 per cent for 2022 and 4 per cent for this year (with additional increases for lower-paid staff). But these are contingent on the union accepting a wide range of changes to working arrangements. They have been described as the best and final offers. The RMT is demanding an unconditional pay offer, a job security agreement and no detrimental changes being imposed on members terms, conditions and working practices. The union also describes Network Rail's plans for maintenance as unsafe, unhealthy for our members and unworkable. The general secretary, Mick Lynch, said that after an in-depth consultation of our 40,000 members the overwhelming view was reject these dreadful offers. He said: Our members cannot accept the ripping up of their terms and conditions or to have safety standards on the railway put into jeopardy under the guise of so-called modernisation. If our union did accept these offers, we would see a severe reduction in scheduled maintenance tasks, making the railways less safe, the closure of all ticket offices and thousands of jobs stripped out of the industry when the railways need more investment not less. Our industrial campaign will continue for as long as it takes to get a negotiated settlement that meets our members' reasonable expectations on jobs, pay and working conditions. They are furious that union members were not given the opportunity to vote on the offers and that the RMT is now demanding an unconditional pay rise. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), representing train operators, said: The RMT agreed from the outset that the industry needed modernisation and understood that was how a pay rise could be funded. The leadership have now reneged on that position and say they not accept any reforms. They know that no employer who has lost 20 per cent of its revenue could accept those terms. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's chief negotiator, said: Instead of offering members a democratic vote with a referendum, the RMT leadership is hiding behind a sham 'consultation'. Further strikes will disrupt passengers and cost employees money - while changing nothing as our package of very modest reforms continues. The RMT is well aware of the precarious position of the railway's finances, with no more money to offer more. Network Rail also flatly rejects the assertion that reforms will increase risk, and says in fact they should make passengers and staff safer. It looks unlikely. The government, which will ultimately sanction and pay for the eventual settlement, and the union now appear to have dug in for a war of attrition. The government knows public confidence is being eroded by the unreliability of trains. But the transport secretary, Mark Harper, says: Modernising working practices must be part of reform. On the current offers to members working for Network Rail and the train operators, he says: Best and final means what it says. The railway, he says, is financially unsustainable. Ministers believe cracks are appearing in the solidarity of the union. The RMT leadership, mean, is betting that it can get a no-strings deal - though rail workers are unlikely to recoup the money they have lost during industrial action in the form of higher pay. It is now a question of who backs down first. Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Far from it. Train drivers belonging to the Aslef union staging their eighth walk-out earlier this month in a similar dispute about pay. They, too, are demanding a no-strings offer. Members of Aslef working for London Underground are striking on 15 March, the day before the first RMT strike, in a bid to bring the Tube system to a halt in a separate dispute over changes to working arrangements and pensions.",0,,,"Network Rail and 14 train operators to strike on Thursday 16 March.

Many hospitals in England have already postponed outpatient appointments or non-urgent operations ahead of the stoppage on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The walkout by 61,000 junior doctors will have a bigger impact than any of the strikes held since December by nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists, NHS England said. The action is expected to see some of the most severe strike disruption of NHS services to date and have a huge impact on the drive to reduce waiting lists for elective care, it said. The British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' union, has designed this first of a threatened series of strikes by junior doctors over pay to be as impactful as possible, as a warning shot to ministers. It is seeking full pay restoration of the 26.2 fall in the real-terms value of trainee doctors' pay it calculates they have experienced since 200809. Newly qualified doctors start their careers in the NHS earning just 14 an hour, the co-chairs of the BMA's junior doctors committee told Rishi Sunak in a letter last Wednesday. Campaigning junior doctors have been highlighting on social media that some baristas earn the same or more. On Friday night Steve Barclay said he has written to junior doctors in the BMA inviting them to enter into pay talks after negotiations with other health unions. The health secretary tweeted that he had contacted the trade union asking it to enter into formal discussions about pay, urging it to call off planned strikes. I have written to BMAJuniorDocs inviting them for formal pay talks on the same basis other health unions accepted, including calling off next week's strike, he said. Let us have a constructive dialogue to make the NHS a better place to work and ensure we deliver the care patients need. The union responded that Barclay had not attended pay talks on Friday. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's medical director, said the service had been working very hard to try to mitigate the impact of the 72-hour walkout. But, he added: While we are doing what we can to avoid having to reschedule appointments, there is no doubt that disruption will be much more severe than before and patients who have been waiting for some time will face postponements across many treatment areas. During the strike, hospitals will use consultants to ensure that they continue to provide services involving potentially life-or-death care - such as AE, critical care, maternity services and long waits for operations, including cancer surgery - as close to normally as possible. Meanwhile, NHS bosses have warned Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, that it will remain stuck in perpetual crisis management unless he agrees to fund a massive expansion of homegrown doctors and nurses. The NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts, has written to Hunt asking him to rebut reports this week that the Treasury is seeking to water down targets in the forthcoming and long-awaited NHS workforce strategy. The plan had aimed to train much larger numbers of health professionals to tackle the massive staff shortage facing the service, which has 124,000 vacancies. As the chair of the Commons health select committee last year, Hunt - who was health secretary for six years - argued strongly for the Treasury to commit to publishing regular independent assessments of the number of staff the NHS needs and to expand training places to provide more recruits. One senior NHS source said that, now he is chancellor, Hunt is arguing that the government should not agree to such commitments, which would cost billions of pounds a year to fulfil. He seems to think that any financial headroom he has should be used to pave the way for the Conservatives to offer tax cuts before the next election, and not to train more doctors, nurses and other NHS staff, which is different to what he said before, said the official. The confederation warns Hunt in its letter, which it has shared with the Guardian, that a failure to agree to binding targets for increased numbers of health professionals will see the NHS continue to be understaffed, with all of the implications that brings for patient care, waiting times, the efficiency of services and for staff morale.",0,,,"Walkout will cause even more disruption than recent action by nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists.

The vessel Nautica, which is expected to arrive in Yemen in early May, was purchased by the UNDP from Belgian shipping company Euronav in March to remove more than a million barrels of oil from the deteriorating Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) Safer vessel. An employee of Euronav confirmed to Xinhua on Thursday that Nautica left the drydock in Zhoushan on Wednesday after receiving maintenance and necessary modifications over the past weeks. The FSO Safer, anchored off the coast of Yemen's Red Sea port of Hodeidah, has not been maintained since 2015 due to the conflict in Yemen, Xinhua news agency reported. The decaying and dilapidated supertanker has been referred to as a floating time-bomb that poses a risk of explosion or oil spill, potentially four times as disastrous as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez incident in the Red Sea, according to the UN's repeated warnings. The UNDP statement warned that a major spill would devastate fishing communities along Yemen's Red Sea coast, resulting in the loss of 2,00,000 livelihoods overnight, with fish stocks taking 25 years to recover. It would also lead to the closure of the essential ports of Hodeidah and Saleef, which are crucial for bringing food, fuel, and life-saving supplies into Yemen where 17 million people are in need of food assistance, as stated by the UNDP. The departure of the Nautica, and its onward journey to the Red Sea, is a significant next step in the complex operation to take on the oil from the Safer, quoted UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner in the statement.

(AP) -- A threat aboard a United Airlines aircraft prompted a massive emergency response that shut down Vermont's international airport for about three hours before authorities determined the plane to be safe. The threat was made Sunday afternoon on a flight en route from Newark, New Jersey, to the Burlington International Airport, Burlington police said. After landing, the plane was taken to a separate area on the tarmac. Authorities searched the plane and its 65 passengers with bomb-sniffing dogs, one of the passengers, State Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, told WCAX-TV. The passengers were able to deplane after sitting on the tarmac for almost two hours, Baruth said. Video from WCAX showed emergency personnel lining up the baggage on the ground in front of the aircraft before searching each piece. Baruth said the passengers were taken into a hangar. They isolated us with police at both ends and they do not know whether one of us could be a bad actor, so that does not feel great, he said. The airport was closed for about three hours and no incoming flights were canceled, said Burlington International Airport Director of Aviation Nicolas Longo. He said that by Monday, most passengers had been reunited with their luggage. He said the airplane's crew was able to rest overnight and depart on their regular schedule Monday morning. Longo would not discuss the details of the investigation. He said the FBI was in charge. Authorities did not release details on the nature of the threat, which MyNBC5 reported was found in a bathroom of the aircraft. The station said the pilot then notified air traffic control. Law enforcement authorities found no credible threat on the aircraft. What we have here is a safe group of people. We have a safe plane. We have a safe airport, said Jon Murad, acting chief of the Burlington Police Department. Longo said the airport staff had trained for emergencies and he was pleased by the response.

The strike coincided with the start of the Munich Security Conference, with more than 40 heads of state and 60 ministers expected to attend. In an early sign of the disruption, Romania's foreign minister, unable to board a cancelled flight, will be forced to fly to Austria and then make the more than four-hour drive to Munich, a Romanian embassy official said. It is the latest in a series of strikes and protests that have hit major European economies, including France, Britain and Spain, as higher food and energy prices knocked incomes and living standards following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. About 295,000 passengers are affected by the cancellation of 2,340 flights at Bremen, Dortmund, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Stuttgart airports, according to the ADV airports association. We really have not had such an escalation through strike action, ADV's Ralph Beisel told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. German trade union Verdi announced the strike on Wednesday after it said collective bargaining efforts for ground service staff, public sector officials and aviation security workers had made little progress. The union has pressed for a 10.5 per cent wage increase, or at least 500 euros a month. If nothing is done about pay now, we will all be in for another chaotic summer, Verdi deputy chair Christine Behle told Inforadio on Friday. It is about sending a really strong signal. Among the airlines affected, Lufthansa said it had been forced to cancel more than 1,300 flights and suspend operations at the hub airports Frankfurt and Munich on Friday. The carrier declined to give an estimate of the cost of the strike, but has on previous occasions said such action costs it 10 to 15 million euros (15.5 to 23.4 million) a day.

The village in Dadu district, about 380km (235 miles) from Pakistan's largest city Karachi, was one of the worst affected by last year's catastrophic floods, caused by melting glaciers and record monsoons - both induced by climate change. The floods affected 33 million people, destroyed 2.2 million homes and killed more than 1,700 people. For Haleema Aslam, the floodwaters brought distress and misery as they washed away her mature crops and livestock along with her dreams. Indebted to a local landlord for years, the 45-year-old lost her livelihood in the disaster. Before floods I worked in the agricultural fields from dawn to dusk to raise my five children and raise my livestock to make ends meet. Now there is no land for cultivation and all my livestock - over a dozen goats, four buffaloes and three cows - drowned, Aslam told Al Jazeera. Seven months after the deluge, Aslam still feels the trauma of the August night, followed by days of walking after she was compelled to leave her house. She is among 7.2 million female agricultural workers in Pakistan now exposed to extreme weather events, according to a 2018 report (PDF) by the United Nations. Living in the tents was difficult for me and my family. There were attacks of snakes and other reptiles, especially at night. So we moved back to our house after two months even though our house was submerged. But when we returned, it rained again and drowned our house, forcing us to migrate again, said Aslam. Women forced to stay in open-air tents for extended periods due to natural disasters have faced challenges related to privacy and societal norms, with Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman calling the unprecedented floods the worst humanitarian disaster of this decade. Despite donors pledging 9bn of flood aid to Pakistan, Aslam has not received a cent to rebuild her house. The International Labour Organization (ILO) says disruptions and job losses due to floods affected about 4.3 million workers in Pakistan. According to the ILO data, the percentage of female employment in the agriculture sector is 65 percent, making it the country's biggest employer which contributes 23 percent to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). But women are often denied labour rights and protections, employed without written contracts, and mostly get lower wages than men. Moreover, with Pakistan being one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the agriculture sector remains particularly exposed to extreme weather conditions and their aftermath. Seema Chandio, 43, is another resident of Dital Khan Chandio village whose house and 15 acres (six hectares) of land owned by her family were submerged for three months. Water stood up to seven feet in our house - well above my height. It took nearly three months to recede and we lived like nomads, she told Al Jazeera. When Chandio returned to her village, her house had completely vanished. We had bought seeds, fertilisers and pesticides from the market. All our rice and cotton crops were destroyed, resulting in a huge loss. We purchased the seeds, fertilisers and pesticides again for the next wheat crop, but we were unable to sow on time due to the presence of water that had not receded until January, she said, as she worked on rebuilding her house. Since the floods, my family is under a debt of 300,000 rupees (1,060). This amount does not account for the potential profits that could have been earned from the two crop seasons we lost, she added. Although the floodwaters have receded in most of the affected areas, 1.8 million people still live near dirty and stagnant water, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), leading to a loss of agricultural livelihoods for women for two consecutive crop seasons. My family's bread and butter revolves around farming in which every member takes part. After losing the paddy crop completely, we could only cultivate wheat as water was still standing. It will hurt us the whole year as we would not be able to feed our family without any relief from the government, Chandio said. Labour and gender rights activists say last year's floods that destroyed two consecutive crops resulted in a significant amount of debt for peasants, including women. When monsoons arrived, the standing crops of cotton and rice were washed away. As water did not recede in subsequent months, the upcoming wheat season was also severely affected. The situation has led to losses instead of profits from these back-to-back crop losses. Consequently, women farmers who were unable to work on their farms for six months or more are now burdened with debts, Akram Khaskheli, a farmer, human rights activist and president of a charity group told Al Jazeera. Azra Ameer still lives in a tent. She lost most of her cattle in the floods, leaving her with no means of income to support her family. With her husband sick and bedridden, she faces an uncertain future and an uphill battle to rebuild her life. The flood-related trauma we have faced in multiple forms will haunt us for a lifetime. It has shattered our lives, the 30-year-old livestock worker told Al Jazeera. Experts say that while developed countries set up a loss and damage fund at the 2022 COP27 climate change conference, it does not account for the losses suffered by vulnerable countries such as Pakistan. Any climate fund needs to be proportional to the damage that has been caused by the biggest emitters, and it should be mandatory for the biggest polluters to pledge a portion of their annual budget towards paying reparations and there should be a mechanism to enforce these payments, Osama Malik, an environmental lawyer, told Al Jazeera. However, Malik added that in Pakistan, where financial transparency is dismal, there should also be a mechanism to ensure that money from the loss and damage fund should be utilised properly on flood victims such as female labourers and should not wasted inefficiently or embezzled. In the past, we have seen that whenever a disaster has struck Pakistan, whether in the form of earthquake, floods or even COVID-19 pandemic, much of the funds or aid that came from abroad were utilised by the military without much oversight, resulting in further weakening of civilian institutions. It is hoped that any climate reparation funds will not be utilised in a similar fashion, Malik said.",0,,,"Haleema Aslam is among 7.2 million female agricultural workers in Pakistan exposed to extreme weather events.

Kerry O'Brien, Frank O'Brien, and William Gross reportedly left April 4, and intended to make a provisions stop in Cabo San Lucas, roughly 200 nautical miles across the Sea of Cortez, on April 6 before heading to San Diego, the YOU.S. Coast Guard said. However, there was no record of them arriving in Cabo San Lucas or a report in of their location, the Coast Guard said in a statement Friday. Gross' daughter, Melissa Spicuzza, said the O'Briens invited her father to sail with them and he jumped at the chance because he loves being on the water, according to NBC San Diego.

Each missing American, Spicuzza said, has decades of sailing experience, and the O'Briens have Coast Guard captain's licenses, required for voyages with paying passengers.

A small group of protesters hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and hand grenades, before dispersing to nearby streets. At least 57 people were killed and dozens were injured on Tuesday when a passenger train with more than 350 people on board collided with a freight train on the same track in central Greece. After protests over the past three days across the country, some 10,000 students, railway workers and groups affiliated with left-wing parties gathered in an Athens square on Sunday to express sympathy for the lives lost and to demand better safety standards on the rail network. That crime will not be forgotten, protesters shouted as they released black balloons into the sky. A placard read: Their policies cost human lives. The train, travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki, was packed with university students returning after a long holiday weekend. The disaster has triggered an outpouring of anger, as well as a sharp focus on safety standards. Railway workers, who also lost colleagues in the accident, have staged rotating walkouts since Wednesday to denounce cost-cutting and underinvestment in the rail infrastructure, a legacy of Greece's debilitating debt crisis from 2010 to 2018. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's government has blamed human error for the crash. However, Mitsotakis said on Sunday that human error should not deflect from responsibilities for a long-suffering railway network. As prime minister, I owe everyone, but most of all the relatives of the victims, an apology, he wrote on Facebook. Justice will very fast investigate the tragedy and determine liabilities. A station master in the nearby city of Larissa who was on duty at the time of the crash was charged this week with endangering lives and disrupting public transport.

A consultative ballot of almost 35,000 consultants conducted by the union found that 86 pr cent would be prepared to take part in strike action, raising the prospect of severe disruption to NHS services. The BMA said that while a consultative ballot does not provide a legal mandate for strike action, the poll represents the strength of anger among England's senior doctors and it will move to a statutory ballot in April. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA consultants committee, said: In my 25 years in the NHS, I have never seen consultants more demoralised, frustrated and in despair over this Government's refusal to support the NHS workforce and the patients they serve. The Government is refusing to listen to consultants' concerns, driving many out of the NHS entirely. If the Government truly wants to get the NHS back on track and tackle the record waiting lists, it must support the consultant workforce. Our position is clear - we will not allow the Government to continue to degrade consultants' pay and pensions. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: If this is the strength of feeling from consultants now, the worry is that some could be less inclined to cover shifts during the upcoming junior doctors strikes next week, leaving patient care at increased risk. While it is positive that the other trade unions have agreed to suspend their planned industrial action to enter negotiations with the government, it is important for all parts of the NHS's workforce to have the same opportunity to have their concerns around pay understood. The danger of not doing this is that the war of attrition between both sides will continue and escalate further, which no one wants. Meanwhile, junior doctor members of the BMA will strike for 72 hours from March 13 in a bitter dispute over pay and conditions. But industrial action by paramedics, nurses and physiotherapists has been suspended as union officials enter intensive talks with Health Secretary Steve Barclay over pay. Mr Barclay had previously infuriated unions by exclusively opening talks with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), but the Government last week invited health unions to formal pay talks through the NHS staff council, which traditionally sets NHS pay. Pay for RCN members is covered by the NHS-wide Agenda for Change agreement, which also includes other NHS workers. NHS Providers' chief executive Sir Julian Hartley said: This move by consultants is another worrying development for NHS trust leaders, on top of the looming three-day strike by junior doctors. Strikes by consultants would heap yet more pressure on overstretched services. Patient safety and care is the top priority. Trust leaders urge the government and the BMA to find a resolution quickly.",0,,,"BMA said tens of thousands of senior hospital doctors would vote on potential industrial action on April 17.

Authorities have not yet found the black box of the ill-fated aircraft belonging to the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRAU), sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP), Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh, Durgesh Armon told PTI. On Sunday, the bodies of flight instructor pilot Mohit Thakur and trainee pilot Vrikshanka Maheshwari who were killed in the aircraft crash in Balaghat district were handed over to their families. The bodies of both the deceased have been handed over to their families after completing formalities and the reason for the crash could only be ascertained after the probe, IGRAU spokesperson Ramkishore Dwivedi said. Thakur (24) was a resident of Brungal in Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh and trainee pilot Maheshwari (19) hailed from Gandhidham in Kutch district of Gujarat, he said. The trainer aircraft had taken off from the Birsi airstrip in Gondia district bordering Balaghat at around 3.06 pm on Saturday. It lost connection with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) at 3.11 pm and crashed in the hills near Bhukkutola village in Balaghat, and caught fire, officials had said. Meanwhile, a police officer from MP denied the claim that the aircraft might have crashed due to bad weather in the hilly area, about 40 km off the Balaghat district headquarters. The weather was clear, he said. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com An IGRAU official had said on Saturday that bad weather could have caused the crash. Teams of ATC Gondia and Amethi have not yet reached the crash site, an MP police official said. Meanwhile, Dwivedi said, A two-member Air Safety Team has reached Birsi to probe the crash and the exact reason can be ascertained only after they submit their report. The aircraft involved in the mishap was a Diamond DA-40 type single-engine aircraft and such an aircraft does not have a black box. Moreover, the aircraft had been destroyed completely after the crash.

Maura T. Healey's proposed state budget -- would be an east-west rail park-and-ride stop for the region, boosters say. It is a Palmer stop, said Ben Hood, chair of the Palmer Station Steering Committee. But it is also a UMass stop. It is an east side of Springfield stop. We expect people from Sixteen Acres to come here. The budget item is the first official acknowledgement that east-west rail would have a stop in Palmer. East-west rail is the planned implementation of fast and frequent train service from Boston to Springfield, Pittsfield and possibly as far west as Albany, N.Y. Today, only the Chicago-bound Lake Shore Limited makes the east-west trip once a day and it does not stop in Palmer. Hood's wife, Anne Miller, co-founder of the group Citizens for a Palmer Rail Stop, said the station could draw Boston- or Albany-bound passengers from as far south as Stafford Springs, Connecticut. And the center of the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus is just 20 minutes away with The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority eager to run shuttle buses from a Palmer rail station to the Haigis Mall at UMass. Hood said: A UMass student will have the choice of going to Northampton to get on the Valley Flyer to Springfield or going to Palmer to get a train to Boston. The town of Palmer is also preparing a request for proposals seeking consultants to that study and design work, Hood said. Palmer touts itself as the town of seven railroads and is still a hub for east-west and north-south freight traffic. But it has not had passenger service since 1971, shortly after the old Penn Central went bankrupt. When Amtrak took over, it eliminated the stop. Hood said the stop would be near the town's historic train depot, now the Steaming Tender restaurant, an H.H. Richardson design built in 1883. But Miller said anew station would be built to modern Amtrak standards with a longer platform raised to allow wheelchair access. It would have a small building for restrooms and cleaning equipment but plenty of parking. The cost of a Palmer station, per the capital costs appendix of the East-West Rail Passenger Study in January 2021, was 12.4 million. The east-west project money is coming from revenues created from the Fair Share Amendment, Miller said. Healey included 4 million for the study and design of a Palmer station as well as 8.5 million for track improvements in Pittsfield in her proposed budget released Wednesday. YOU.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield, said the budget proposal demonstrates Healey's commitment to the east-west rail project he is backing, and has backed, on the federal level. It is a commitment she related when she was my guest at the State of the Union and it is a commitment she reiterated the next day when she met with the delegation, said Neal, dean of the state's congressional delegation. I think the biggest task before us now is track improvements, Neal said Thursday. Once we do that, everything else will fall into place. State Rep. William Smitty Pignatelli, D-Lenox, said the Pittsfield work would create a side track, allowing passenger trains stopped at the Pittsfield station to get serviced, replenished or to wait overnight for another run to get off CSX's main east-west rail line and out of the way. To me, it shows that she is committed to making the kind of investments we need in Pittsfield and Palmer to kick this thing off, he said. The budget is also an official acknowledgement that east-west rail will extend to Pittsfield, or possibly as far west as Albany as Amtrak would like. Amtrak, which would run east-west rail trains and sell the tickets, wants to link busy stations on Boston and Albany-Rensselaer and has identified improvements it wants to see on a route which is owned by freight railway CSX. Three cheers for Gov. Healey and Lt. Gov. (Kim) Driscoll, said state Rep. Todd M. Smola, R-Warren, whose district includes Palmer. Very early on they have seen the value of a project we have been working on for some time. Smola said the budget still has to go to the state House of Representatives and the State Senate. But, as ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, he will be part of the conference committee that will have final say. The state legislature last year set up an east-west rail commission charged with hearing public input, with coming up with a governance system and applying for federal funds. But the commission has only had two of its six required meetings and its report is due March 31. Smola said the supplementary budget now winding its way through Beacon Hill would extend the deadline for that state commission. Pignatelli said he is worried that the commission is losing focus. It is up to commission members to keep their foot on the pedal. We cannot let any delays happen, he said. In December, the state Department of Transportation and rail companies Amtrak and CSX Corp. applied this week for 108 million in federal transportation money to help fund improvements along the 53 miles of railroad between Springfield and Worcester. It is through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program. In June, Springfield Union Station received 1.75 million from the CRISI program for track upgrades including additional platforms, additional crossover tracks, storage tracks, a new layover facility, Neal said he expects to hear word on the 108 million CRISSI grant at about the end of this month. Meanwhile, the federal commitment to the project remains strong. The president is very excited about the infrastructure program, Neal said. I was just with the president (Wednesday night) in Baltimore where he spoke very enthusiastically about the infrastructure law. Speaking with the YOU.S. House Democratic Conference, President Joe Biden cited a rail project in Baltimore, especially the rebuilding of a 100-year-old rail tunnel. It is going to change transportation not only on the Northeast Corridor. But instead of 30 miles an hour, it is going through there at 100 miles an hour. And it is a 4 billion investment. And guess what? We are going to let everybody know you did it. These are the signs we are going to put up, Biden said. We are renaming it the Frederick Douglass Tunnel.",0,,,"The Palmer rail stop could get a 4 million boost under Gov. Maura T. Healey's proposed state budget.

A tropical cyclone is forecast to be the most powerful storm to hit Australia in eight years, bringing extraordinary wind speeds that could take some Western Australia residents by surprise. Tropical Storm Ilsa will cross the northwest Pilbara coast, where cyclones are common. It is expected to make landfall between the iron ore export town of Port Hedland and the Wallal Downs Station cattle ranch. The storm is projected to bring wind gusts of up to 196 miles per hour, according to meteorologists. The category 5 cyclone strengthened over the Indian Ocean on Thursday and was expected to maintained that destructive level early Friday, per the Australia Bureau of Meteorology. FORT LAUDERDALE FLOODING FORCES AIRPORT TO CLOSE, LEAVES DRIVERS STRANDED FOR HOURS Category 5 cyclones have mean wind speeds exceeding 124 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 174 miles per hour. The last category 5 storm in Australia was Cyclone Marcia in 2015. That storm caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in Queensland. The Category 5 Cyclone Veronica did not cross the Pilbara cost in March 2019, but damaged infrastructure and disrupted the region's mining and offshore gas industry. Ahead of this cyclone, police have closed the highway along the Pilbara coast, and officials expect that the North West Coastal Highway will be impassable due to flooding. WEATHER OFFICIALS RETIRING NAMES FIONA, IAN FROM LIST OF TROPICAL CYCLONE NAMES Many in Ilsa's path have evacuated the area, including ranchers, miners, indigenous locals and tourists. People who were living in structures not built to withstand a Category 4 storm were told to leave, according to Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm. He said that extra emergency workers, essential supplies and aircraft have also been sent to the region.

THE GOVERNMENT WILL be asked to approve plans to appoint the Dublin Airport Authority (daa) as the operator of counter-drone technology at Dublin Airport. Flight activity at the Airport was briefly suspended last Thursday due to drone activity, the sixth such disruption in as many weeks. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan came in for scathing criticism from Ryanair's Michael O'Leary last week, when the airline boss said that anti-drone technology is a reasonably easy solution that would only cost around 100,000. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan and Junior Minister Jack Chambers will today ask Cabinet to task daa with purchasing counter drone technology. Ministers will also be asked to consider plans to conduct a wider examination of the need of counter drone technology to protect key state infrastructure such as other airports, energy generation and transmission facilities, defence forces facilities, Government buildings and water infrastructure. It is understood an existing state agency will be tasked with leading this work. Following the decision today, there will be a short period where training is undertaken and the technology is delivered to Dublin Airport. No primary legislation is required to enable its use at the airport, it is believed. Operations at Dublin Airport have been suspended on six separate occasions since late January, resulting in safety risks to aviation, diverted and delayed flights and severe disruption to passenger journeys. Chambers yesterday told Newstalk's Hard Shoulder that Dublin Airport should have the counter-drone technology in place within a number of weeks. In a statement this evening, daa CEO Kenny Jacobs said: We are glad the State has made a decision on this important issue. Given this is a state-wide issue, we remain of the view that the ultimate owners of this must be An Garda Sochna or the Department of Defence. However, we are already progressing this at pace in the interests of the public safety and to prevent travel disruption. Exact timelines cannot be confirmed just yet given the requirement to identify and procure the most suitable technology, engage with the Irish Aviation Authority on its use and train those that will ultimately deploy it. Advertisement He added: But we are moving very quickly, and we will have this technology in place as soon as possible. Education Separately tomorrow, Education Minister Norma Foley will update Cabinet today on the new primary curriculum framework which sets out that children will spend more time learning foreign languages, science, technology and their wellbeing. The new primary curriculum compiled by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is due to be published this week. It maps out an overhaul of the curriculum which will see children in third class onwards spending one hour a week to learn a language that is not English or Irish. There is a new focus on science, technology, engineering and maths education, while children will spend up to three hours per week on wellbeing programmes. With much debate centered around the role religion plays in out national schools, the subject is to be reduced by half an hour, to two hours per week, with students also set to be taught ethical and multi-belief education. In addition, Justice Minister Harris will seek Government approval today give the go-ahead to a major student accommodation project at DCU. An allocation of 40 million will go towards building the new 405 bed building on campus, with 30 of the project to be ring fenced for students from a disadvantaged area at a reduced rent. The minister will also confirm work is ongoing with UCD, Trinity and UCC on similar projects and he expects to revert to Government with further proposals shortly. The Minister will state this policy will help more student access accommodation and also relieve some of the pressures in the housing market. Similar Government support has been provided for University of Limerick, University of Galway and Maynooth University, with Government approval provided for these projects in November. Meanwhile, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly will ask Cabinet to sign off on the Health (Amendment) Bill 2023, which will abolish the statutory public inpatient charges of 80 per day, up to a maximum of 800 in a year. The measure, which was announced in last year's budget, will mean people will no longer be charged when accessing public inpatient care in our public hospitals.

The blockbuster trial -- originally set to begin in a Delaware court on Monday before being delayed by one day -- will determine whether Fox Corporation can be held liable for false claims made on Fox News, the media company's namesake cable TV property, that Dominion's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election. Dominion's lawsuit seeks 1.6 billion in compensatory damages, an amount that experts said would likely be whittled down substantially depending on the jury's judgment or in an out-of-court settlement. The media company contests any claims of liability or damages sought by Dominion, with a Fox spokesperson calling the lawsuit a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights. In the event Dominion wins its case, said Lyrissa Lidsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of Florida, the jury is highly unlikely to award Dominion all the money it is seeking for what it says is the reputational damage exacted by Fox News' broadcasts. In theory, Lidsky said, the jurors could also impose punitive damages to punish Fox for extremely wrongful conduct and award an even higher financial penalty than Dominion asked for. But she said she had seen no evidence thus far that suggests there are going to be damages at that magnitude, even though the damages may be very large. There is a litigation strategy to ask for more than you think you can really get to anchor the number high, Lidsky explained. With more than 4 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of the end of 2022, Fox could probably cover even the maximum amount that Dominion is seeking without having to sell any of its existing assets to do so. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Fox said it did not expect the ultimate resolution of any claims from the suit to have a material adverse effect on its business. Wall Street analysts say the publicly traded company's stock is likely to take a hit as a result of the suit. Bank of America Securities estimated in a March 28 note that for every 500 million in damages, shares of Fox Corporation would lose about 1 per share. The company's stock, which was trading at 33.62 late Monday morning, has fallen by more than 10 since Dominion filed its lawsuit in March 2021, a period in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 2. BofA Securities suggested that the lawsuit was likely to keep Fox's stock from moving substantially over the course of what is expected to be a six-week trial as legal proceedings continue to unearth details about debates inside Fox over its airing of falsehoods about Dominion. At a minimum, the constant barrage of negative headlines should be an overhang on near-term investor sentiment, the BofA Securities analysts wrote. The Fox spokesperson did not comment on the business impact of any damages it might have to shoulder or on its stock outlook. The case has also raised scrutiny on the media company's editorial strategy as signs have emerged of gaps between what was reported on air and what some insiders -- apparently with an eye on Fox's business -- indicated they knew to be true. Details from the case show Fox News personalities growing increasingly concerned about losing viewers to competing network Newsmax in the days following the 2020 election. Texts and emails disclosed in Dominion's filing suggest that Fox hosts then pushed back against efforts to set the record straight on the outcome of the election -- allegedly to keep viewers from changing the channel. Following an instance in which a Fox reporter noted that there was no evidence of voting system fraud, prime time host Tucker Carlson texted fellow Fox anchor Sean Hannity calling for her to be fired. It is measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke, Carlson texted on November 12, 2020. The company's 2019 decision to exit its TV and movie businesses may have added pressure to hang on to viewers, said Gabriel Kahn, a journalism professor at the University of Southern California. After Disney purchased the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox for 71 billion in 2019, the remainder of Rupert Murdoch's media company -- known henceforth as Fox Corporation -- became focused on its news, sports and business broadcast operations. After the deal, Kahn said, they doubled down on polarization and audience fragmentation, adding that it became absolutely, existentially important to keep that audience engaged. Still, Fox News dominates the cable news rankings. According to Nielsen live plus data, The Five, Tucker Carlson Tonight and Jesse Watters Primetime were the three most-watched cable news shows in 2022. Over that time, Fox's advertising revenue grew by almost 9. The relationship between editorial decisions at Fox and the company's business strategy, Lidsky said, could be relevant in the case as Dominion tries to prove that Fox aired false information with reckless disregard -- part of the legal standard that will be key in determining whether Dominion was defamed. A business incentive to ignore the truth or falsity of what they were putting out there, that might tend to show reckless disregard, Lidsky said.",0,,,"Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox Corporation for $1.6 billion in damages.

It has pitched the needs of tillage farmers and the rapidly growing brewing industry against the desire of locals to protect the rural character of their area, and to limit further heavy truck movements on roads already under severe pressure from the quarrying operations in their area. But, as the value of Irish whiskey exports soars, exceeding 1bn for the first time last year -- and with Irish Distillers, unconnected to this situation, but planning a 250m expansion of its Midleton distillery nearby which will lead to a near 50 increase in its demand for barley and malted barley -- it is a row likely to be seen again. Many residents gathered at the site of the proposed grain storage facility last week to demonstrate their anger, and said they have written to the board calling for a reversal of the decision ahead of the deadline later this week, for the lodging of a possible judicial review. They say many of the issues cited by the board in its decision to refuse planning to another applicant for a much larger truck haulage depot operation on the same site in 2007 are still valid. They say they have serious concerns about the development's potential impact on the designated Metropolitan Cork greenbelt, on the rural character of the area, of its impact on the road network and road safety in an area already struggling to cope with heavy trucks linked to several extensive quarry operations, and on the potential for noise, pest, and dust nuisance. They conducted their own 12-hour traffic survey last week which they say shows, unofficially at least, a 50 increase on traffic volumes compared to the applicant's figures, some of which they say were gathered during covid, and do not reflect the reality on the ground. They said: No matter how it is dressed up, and whatever boxes have been ticked off to make it technically viable for planners to give permission, getting up to 30,000 tonnes of barley in and out of this site annually is going to have a huge negative impact on us residents. In a statement, Owenacurra Agri said the company had engaged with concerned locals in the area prior to submitting the planning application. All issues of concern have been dealt with through the planning process at both Cork County Council and An Bord Pleanla. The company would like to take the opportunity to thank all those in support of this project, it said. The site in Barryscourt is about 1.25km south of Carrigtwohill, about 1km along a local road from the N25. The 15th century Barryscourt Castle, which is undergoing restoration, is about 850m to the north west. The site was previously owned by BECAUSE Transport, which was refused planning in 2007 on four key grounds -- including its location in the greenbelt -- for a large haulage depot with parking for 100 trucks and 54 cars and a truck servicing building. It was considered at the time that the industrial nature of the depot would contravene specific objectives in the then county development plan to preserve the character of the greenbelt, and to reserve it generally for use as agriculture, open space, or recreation. It was shot down also because of its location in an unserviced rural area, at a significant distance from the strategic road network, and on grounds that the proposed development could endanger public safety as the local road network was inadequate to cater for the substantial increase in truck movements likely to be generated by the depot. Owenacurra Agri's successful plan The site changed ownership and was eventually acquired in early 2020 by father and son, Maurice and Cormac Smiddy, who run Midleton-based Owenacurra Agri, a division of Southern Fuel and Farm Supplies. Owenacurra Agri lodged a planning application with Cork County Council in March 2021 for the construction of a large 2,827 sq m agricultural grain store, with three storage bays, a silo, elevators, conveyors, and a drying and air handling plant on part of the site. No mock-up images showing the proposed structure were included in the application. Some 46 submissions were made, most objecting to the development, many flagging a range of planning policy and road safety issues, which were also flagged in 2007. One submission highlighted the scale of the proposed building in a rural setting, which at four storeys high, and four to five times as long, it said could be compared to an industrial unit normally found in industrial estates. Following a request for further information on a range of issues, including the development's potential impact on roads and traffic, a raft of documents were submitted, including a visual impact assessment with CGI images of the proposed structure, and planning was granted in November 2021 with 44 conditions. Decision appealed That decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanla by Pat and John Ahern, who live close by, by Frank and Catherine Brennan, and by Caroline Harte, whose submission residents say represents the vast majority of the 46 submissions made to the council. An observation was also made by An Taisce, flagging concerns about the potential visual impact on Barryscourt Castle. The appeals argued that the grain store should be considered a commercial, and not an agricultural operation, they raised concerns about its impact on roads and road safety, on the visual character of the area, on nearby homes, of potential overshadowing of adjoining fields, as well as potential noise, dust, and pest nuisance. Residents also pointed out that any road improvements since the rejected project in 2007 have been minor and cosmetic, and they pointed out that since, a major EU cycling route has been now designated nearby. Inspector's report In her report, An Bord Pleanla inspector Siobhn Carroll noted that since the Cork County Development Plan 2022-2028 came into effect last June, the subject site is located outside of the area which is designated as prominent and strategic metropolitan greenbelt and is located on unzoned rural lands. She said the development plan refers to agriculture and farm diversification and seeks to encourage the development of sustainable agriculture and related infrastructure including farm buildings. Ms Carroll added: I would consider that the proposed agricultural grain store does come within the scope of related agricultural infrastructure. She accepted that the applicant had provided a clear case for the specific requirement for the grain store at this location, and said she considered it as an appropriate use to this rural area. She said the proposal for green cladding on the warehouse and tree screening would reduce the visual intrusion upon the surrounding landscape to low to imperceptible. She also said she was satisfied that the surrounding road network can accommodate the traffic levels which would be generated by the proposed development. She recommended a condition imposing certain noise limits on the facility at certain times, the need for a comprehensive noise survey to be undertaken by the applicant during each grain drying season, and a condition dealing with dust emissions, dust control, and directing that there shall be no open storage of grain on the site. However, residents said all the conditions in the world will make little or no difference, and they expressed concerns that operations at the site could expand in the future. The roads are not designed to accommodate current HGV traffic, not to mention the additional haulage of up to 30,000 tonnes of barley.

It has pitched the needs of tillage farmers and the rapidly growing brewing industry against the desire of locals to protect the rural character of their area. Many residents gathered at the site of the proposed grain storage facility last week to demonstrate their anger, and said they have written to the board calling for a reversal of the decision."

It is the first time Italy has resorted to such a drastic measure since 2011, the height of the European migrant crisis. Italy's Ministry for Civil Protection and Maritime Policies said the measure was necessary due to the surging numbers of people coming to Italy since the beginning of the year, plus overcrowding in facilities in hotspots like the tiny island of Lampedusa. Since the beginning of the year, some 31,000 migrants have arrived in Italy according to data from the Interior Ministry - more than triple the year before. Many were either rescued by Italian military boats or humanitarian ships or reached Italy's shores without any assistance. The number of arrivals is expected to carry on soaring as the weather improves in the spring and summer, with 3,000 people making landfall in the last five days alone. The state of emergency -- which will last for six months -- will dispense initial funding of 5 million euros. Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government says this will be used to create new structures, suitable both for sheltering as well as the processing and repatriation of migrants who do not have the requisites to stay. New facilities will mean Italy can identify and repatriate more people who are not allowed to stay, as Rome continues its years-long effort to crack down on illegal immigration. Known as CPR in Italy, they are marred with controversy. For years, NGOs and human rights groups have criticised what they call inhumane and degrading conditions inside migrant facilities. While the last time Italy declared a state of emergency over illegal immigration was in 2011 -- during the fourth government of media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi -- the country has recently declared a state of emergency over other issues. One was declared in 2020 over the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for the government to mandate by decree and temporarily bypass the long parliamentary process for funding and regulations. Meloni's government is currently trying to pass a series of policies targeting migrants. Measures under consideration will speed up the process of identifying and processing individuals who do not qualify to stay in Italy. They could also abolish or modify rules around the special protection status granted to asylum seekers who cannot be considered refugees but cannot be expelled because they are considered at risk. Though requirements around special protection status used to be strict, a 2020 reform extended it to anyone who suffers persecution in their country of origin because of race, sex, gender, identity, citizenship, religion, political opinion, and personal or social conditions. In 2022, some 10,000 people qualified for special protection status in Italy. Meloni's government claims restricting access to it will deter migrants from making the perilous journey from North Africa to Italy, which would help prevent tragedies like the one near Cutreo, in the southern region of Calabria, when 93 died after a horrific shipwreck in Feburary. The Italian government says the state of emergency is just a temporary fix to a problem which requires a European-wide solution. According to Matteo Salvini, now Deputy Prime Minister, Europe needs to wake up and intervene: for years it has been talking without ever moving a finger, and now it is the time to show that there is a community, a Union, and solidarity does not fall just on Italy, Spain, Greece or Malta. The far-right politician called for Europe to contribute to Italy's efforts to cope with migrant arrivals, saying that rescue efforts, as well as processing procedures, are unsustainable for the country economically, culturally, socially. But while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently declared that it is clear that migration is a European challenge that requires a European solution, Italy says it has not yet received the support it needs to face the growing influx of migrants.

Israel has attacked Aleppo airport several times in recent years. (File) Damascus: Israeli warplanes struck Aleppo airport before dawn Tuesday, causing significant damage that halted flights to and from Syria's war- and quake-battered second city, the defence ministry said. The airport has been a major conduit for aid flights since a February 6 earthquake devastated swathes of southeastern Turkey and neighbouring Syria, and they too were brought to a stop, a transport ministry official said. At exactly 2:07 am (2307 GMT Monday), the Israeli enemy carried out an air attack from the Mediterranean west of Latakia targeting Aleppo international airport, Syria's defence ministry said in a statement. The damage forced authorities to close the airport to all flights, the ministry added. There was no immediate word on any casualties. More than 80 aid flights have landed in Aleppo over the past month with relief supplies for quake-hit areas, transport ministry official Suleiman Khalil told AFP. It is no longer possible to receive aid flights until the damage has been repaired, he said, adding that the strike had put the runway out of service. Aid deliveries have been diverted to Damascus and Latakia airports, a ministry statement said. An Israeli military spokesperson declined to comment on the reported strike. It marked the second Israeli attack on government-held areas since the devastating quake struck Turkey and Syria, killing more than 50,000 people in the two countries. On February 19, an Israeli strike killed 15 people in a Damascus district housing state security agencies. Israel has attacked Aleppo airport several times in recent years, with a strike last September putting it out of service for a few days.

(Credit: Raymond Rodriguez via Storyful) A tornado tore through a Southern California community on Wednesday, injuring one person and damaging structures. The National Weather Service Office in Los Angeles said that the rare twister was an EF1, a measurement on the Enhanced Fujita Scale that indicates it had winds of 86 to 110 mph. It touched down shortly before 11:15 a.m. PT in Montebello, and was the strongest tornado to hit the Los Angeles metropolitan area since March 1983. The agency said its path was 50 yards wide and that it was on the ground for two to three minutes. CALIFORNIA HAMMERED BY STRONG STORM, AT LEAST 2 DEAD Alex Gillman, a spokesman for the city, said one person was hurt and taken to the hospital. He did not know the severity of the injury. The National Weather Service said 17 structures were damaged, with 11 significantly impacted and red-tagged as uninhabitable. A tree was uprooted and a power pole was snapped with the transformer ripped off. The tornado primarily ripped through an industrial warehouse and commercial business district. Cars there were damaged and a near-total roof collapse occurred in one building. Warehouse roofing material collapsed and an HVAC unit was ejected from the top of the building. Skylights were broken and wood cross beams came down. ARMY CORP INVESTIGATING NEW ORLEANS FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM AFTER DRAINAGE PUMP CORRODED IN 5 YEARS It got very loud.

Dressed in a heavy blue jacket, Mr Putin was shown on Russian state television descending from a military helicopter in south Kherson and greeting senior military commanders. It is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information, Mr Putin told the commanders. It comes as reports suggest that French president Emmanuel Macron is working on a set of secret plans with China which could bring an end to Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Mr Macron has reportedly deployed his foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne to work in tandem with China's top diplomat Wang Yi to establish a framework that could bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table by this summer. 08:12 , Katy Clifton Vladimir Putin has visited military headquarters in Russian-controlled Ukraine, the Kremlin said this morning, where he discussed the war with a general from Russia's airborne troops who has reportedly taken up a powerful new role in the invasion. Moscow claims to have annexed four Ukrainian regions but its forces are locked in a grinding artillery battle in the eastern Donbas with heavy losses on both sides, while they have been forced to pull back in southern Kherson, which Mr Putin visited. Dressed in a heavy blue jacket, Mr Putin, 70, was shown on Russian state television descending from a military helicopter in Russian-held Ukraine and greeting senior military commanders. The Kremlin said Mr Putin attended a military command meeting in Kherson region. He heard reports from commanders of the airborne forces and the Dnieper army group and other senior officers on the situation in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. It is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information, Putin told the commanders, including colonel-general Mikhail Teplinsky, commander of Russia's airborne troops. British military intelligence said on Sunday that Teplinsky had been given a major role in the war. Teplinsky, commander of Russia's corps of airborne troops, the VDV, has highly likely returned to a major role in Ukraine, British military intelligence said. Teplinsky is likely one of the few senior Russian generals widely respected by the rank-and-file. 15:52 , Emily Atkinson Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops in the small eastern city of Avdiivka on Tuesday, thanked them for their service and was briefed by commanders on the battlefield situation, his office said. Avdiivka has been one of the main targets of a Russian winter offensive which was intended to reinvigorate Moscow's full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, but has made only small territorial advances in the east. Video footage released by Zelensky's office showed him addressing troops in combat gear and handing them awards in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse with sandbags packed against at least one of the high walls. I have the honour to be here today, to thank you for your service, for defending our land, Ukraine, our families, he said. I wish you only victory - this is what I wish for every Ukrainian, this is what is very important to all of us. Zelensky also visited a hospital where he met wounded soldiers and handed out awards. 15:24 , Emily Atkinson Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will discuss the Ukraine Black Sea export deal with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres when they meet in New York next week, Russia's envoy said on Tuesday. Of course, he will be raising that during his bilateral, Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters. 14:35 , Emily Atkinson French president Emmanuel Macron is working on a set of secret plans with China which could bring an end to Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, reports suggest. Mr Macron has reportedly deployed his foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne to work in tandem with China's top diplomat Wang Yi to establish a framework that could bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table by this summer. Sources familiar with the French initiative told Bloomberg that future talks would depend on several conditions, including a successful Ukrainian spring offensive that would boost Kyiv's position during negotiations. Bloomberg claims that official from Mr Macron's office had confirmed the plan for Mr Bonne to speak with Mr Wang. Romania looked set on Tuesday to follow three other countries in banning Ukrainian grain imports, a setback for Kyiv as it tries to unblock exports through eastern Europe and salvage a wartime deal on shipping grain from the Black Sea. Failure to resume exports into eastern European countries or secure an extension of the Black Sea grain deal would trap large amounts of grain in Ukraine, hitting its exports and causing further economic problems for Kyiv as it battles Russian troops. Talks between Kyiv and Warsaw went into a second day after European Union member states Poland, Hungary and Slovakia imposed import bans to protect their markets from an influx of cheaper supply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party increased pressure on Kyiv by saying it would ask the coalition government to approve an emergency decree enforcing a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports though it wants transit to continue. 12:58 , William Mata A Russian judge on Tuesday upheld the detention of jailed American journalist Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested on spying charges as part of a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on dissent amid the war in Ukraine. Mr Gershkovich and the US government vehemently deny the allegations. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter is the first US correspondent since the Cold War to be detained in Russia on spying allegations and his arrest rattled journalists in the country and elicited outrage in the West. Dozens of journalists crowded into the courtroom to catch a glimpse of Mr Gershkovich, who looked calm as he stood inside a glass cage to appeal his detention. Russia's federal security service detained the 31-year-old in Yekaterinburg in March and accused him of trying to obtain classified information about a Russian arms factory. Gershkovich, his employer and the US government deny he was involved in spying and have demanded his release. Evan is a member of the free press who right up until he was arrested was engaged in newsgathering. Any suggestions otherwise are false, the WSJ has said in a statement. Last week, the US officially declared that Mr Gershkovich was wrongfully detained. Russia has accused the ambassadors of Britain, the United States and Canada of interfering in its internal affairs after they condemned the treason conviction of a prominent opposition politician and it warned them they risk expulsion in future. On Monday, a Moscow court jailed Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza - who holds Russia and British passports - for 25 years after convicting him of treason in a trial he and the West said was politically-motivated. It was the harshest sentence of its kind since Russia invaded Ukraine. Kara-Murza, 41, for years successfully lobbied Western governments to impose sanctions on Russia and individual Russians for purported human rights violations. He also condemned what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. The ambassadors of Britain, the United States and Canada made a joint appearance in front of TV cameras on the steps of the Moscow court after his verdict to condemn the ruling and demand his release. British ambassador Deborah Bronnert delivered her remarks in Russian so that Russian-language TV channels could potentially broadcast them. Russia's Foreign Ministry said the diplomats' behaviour was unacceptable. 12:00 , William Mata Ukraine will try to unblock exports of food and grain through Poland in a second day of talks in Warsaw on Tuesday after some of its staunchest allies in central Europe imposed bans on its products. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have recently banned imports of Ukrainian grains and produce to protect their markets from an influx of cheaper supply. Ukraine's exports via these countries have risen due to Russia's invasion, which has blocked some of its Black Sea ports. Bottlenecks caused by slowed rail shipments or a lack of railcars have exacerbated the problem, trapping large quantities of Ukrainian grain in Central Europe which has lowered prices and hurt sales by local farmers, turning up the heat on governments. 11:30 , William Mata Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko held a meeting with the Russian-installed head of Ukraine's Donetsk region on Tuesday, the state-run Belta news agency reported. It follows a meeting between Mr Lukashenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier in the month (pictured below). Belarus has been a key backer of Russia as many western nations have turned against the Kremlin after the invasion of Ukraine. Hired by the Wall Street Journal shortly before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year, Gershkovich had been reporting on Russia for more than five years at the time of his arrest. The 31-year-old is a fluent Russian-speaker, the son of emigres who left the Soviet Union for the United States during the Cold War. What were the circimstances of his arrest? The FSB security service said on March 30 it had arrested him for trying to gather secrets about Russia's military-industrial complex during a trip to Yekaterinburg, 1,400 km (880 miles) east of Moscow. His newspaper said it last heard from him the previous day when he arrived at a steakhouse in the city. He was brought back to the capital and charged with espionage, for which he faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He has denied the charge, which is also rejected by his newspaper. What do the United States and Russia say about the case? President Joe Biden has called Russia's treatment of Gershkovich totally illegal. The United States last week officially designated him as wrongfully detained, effectively saying that the spy charges were bogus and the case was political. The Kremlin says Gershkovich was caught red-handed, but Russia has yet to publish any evidence to support that. Where is he being held? Gershkovich is in pre-trial detention at Moscow's Lefortovo prison, where the FSB and its predecessor, the Soviet KGB, have traditionally held those suspected of spying or other grave crimes. YOU.S. ambassador Lynne Tracy was able to visit him there for the first time on Monday but gave few details, except that he was healthy and bearing up well. In a handwritten letter dated April 5 to his parents, Gershkovich said he was reading, writing, taking exercise and not losing hope. What happens next? Tuesday's hearing is essentially procedural - about how Gershkovich should be detained as he awaits trial, not about the substance of the charges. Investigators are still working on the details of the case, which could drag on for months or years if the example of fellow American Paul Whelan is anything to go by. Whelan, a former Marine, was arrested in December 2018, held for 18 months in Lefortovo and jailed for 16 years in June 2020 on spying charges. He too is designated by Washington as wrongfully detained. 10:30 , William Mata Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will appeal on Tuesday against his arrest and detention in a former KGB prison in Moscow on charges of espionage, according to court documents. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 30 it had detained Gershkovich in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and had opened an espionage case against him for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military industrial complex. Gershkovich, the first YOU.S. journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, and the Journal have denied he was involved in espionage, as has Washington. According to a public Russian judicial document, a Russian court will hear on Tuesday a complaint filed by Gershkovich against the decision to keep him in custody in Lefortovo prison while the case is being investigated. 10:00 , William Mata The G7 drew together on Tuesday to criticise China's coercion of Taiwan and Russia's threat to station nuclear weapons in Belarus, promising to intensify sanctions on Moscow for its war on neighbouring Ukraine. The strength of the solidarity between the G7 foreign ministers is at a level not seen before, Japan's foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a news conference after hosting a meeting of the group in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa. The show of unity comes after French president Emmanuel Macron this month said the European Union should reduce its dependency on the United States and cautioned against being drawn into a Taiwan crisis. Beijing views Taiwan as Chinese territory and has not renounced the use of force to take the democratically governed island. 09:30 , William Mata Russian forces are stepping up their use of heavy artillery and air strikes in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces said on Tuesday. Fighting in and around Bakhmut has for months been the epicentre of the war in Ukraine. Currently, the enemy is increasing the activity of heavy artillery and the number of air strikes, turning the city into ruins, General Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a statement. He said Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, remained committed to taking Bakhmut at any cost but was suffering significant losses in the battle for the city. Reuters could not confirm the battlefield situation. Russia says Ukrainian forces have also suffered heavy losses in Bakhmut. 09:00 , William Mata Poland and Ukraine will resume negotiations early on Tuesday to try to reopen the transit of food and grains, the Polish agriculture minister told public radio station PR1. Reuters reported two countries held talks on Monday over bans by central eastern European countries seeking to shelter their farmers from the impact of an influx of cheaper Ukrainian grain. Some Black Sea ports were blocked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and large quantities of Ukrainian grain has been trapped in Central Europe because of logistical bottlenecks. We are talking with the EU as well as with Ukraine to find solutions. We want these products to go to Europe, but go deep into Europe, agriculture minister Robert Telus said. We talked yesterday, there were long talks. Today we are also sitting down for talks...These are typically technical talks to find a solution and let this transit go to Europe, he added. 07:30 , Katy Clifton Russia's defence ministry has said this morning that two Russian strategic bombers - those capable of carrying nuclear warheads - carried out routine patrol flights over the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, off Russia's Far East. The statement was reported by the TASS news agency. 07:17 , Arpan Rai A new Pentagon leak has found that Egypt revoked its plans to share thousands of rockets with Russia after talks with senior US officials and instead offered to provide artillery shells for Ukraine. The idea to give rockets to Vladimir Putin was ditched in early March by Egyptian president Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, reported the Washington Post. The US ally then decided to sell 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine via Washington despite the ammunition stockpiles running low in the US. Egypt's president had reportedly ordered 40,000 rockets to be discreetly shipped to Russia, according to some of the classified US intelligence documents that were recently leaked on social media. Discussions between high-level Egyptian officials about the sale of weapons to Russia were found in the series of classified files, reported The Washington Post. The leaked documents made their way to gaming social media platform Discord in February and March. 07:04 , AP Slovakia became the third European Union country to ban food imports from Ukraine on Monday, deepening the challenge for the bloc as it works to help Ukraine transport its grain to world markets, reports Vanessa Gera. Slovakia followed Poland and Hungary, both of which announced bans Saturday on Ukrainian food imports until 30 June. They did so in response to rising anger from farmers who say that a glut of grain in their countries is causing them economic hardship. The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, manages trade on behalf of the 27 member countries and objects to them taking unilateral or uncoordinated measures. EU investigates after 3 countries ban Ukraine grain imports 06:58 , Arpan Rai Russia is likely reorganising its forces and diverting its troops and ammunition in the direction of Bakhmut, the British defence ministry said today as it noted heavy fighting along the Donbas front line. However, there is a realistic possibility that Russia has reduced troop numbers and is decreasing offensive action around Donetsk city, most likely to divert resources towards the Bakhmut sector, the MoD said in its latest intelligence update. It added that Bakhmut has witnessed creeping advances by Russian MoD and Wagner Group forces. The frontline in the town centre largely follows the main railway line, the MoD said. Ukraine is generally holding Russia's envelopment from the south along the line of Korsunskovo Street, the old main road west out of town. For both sides, the exact sequencing of any major drawdown of their units around Bakhmut has become a critical question, with Ukraine wanting to free-up an offensive force while Russia likely aspires to regenerate an operational reserve, the ministry said. 06:40 , Arpan Rai More than 80,500 Russian war crimes, crimes of aggression by Moscow's forces have been recorded in Ukraine, the war-hit country's prosecutor general's office said. The Russian forces have committed 80,840 war crimes and crimes of aggression in Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February last year, the prosecutor general's office said yesterday. 06:35 , Arpan Rai The Group of Seven industrial powers have warned of severe consequences if nuclear weapons are used in Ukraine as their foreign ministers met in Tokyo today. The group, which comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, called Russia's threat to put nuclear weapons in Belarus unacceptable. Any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine would be met with severe consequences, the G7 said. The alliance said that they are more united than ever as they also slammed China's added pressure on Taiwan in addition to Russia's threat to station nuclear weapons in Belarus. The G7 communique highlights how the dual issues of Russian military intervention and fears of similar action by China against Taiwan have been a focus of the three-day meeting. 06:11 , Andy Gregory American journalist Evan Gershkovich, a 31-year-old reporter for The Wall Street Journal, has been arrested and detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

This is the first time we have had consular access to Evan since his wrongful detention over two weeks ago, said Lynne Tracy in a short statement in Russian on Telegram. He feels well and is holding up. We reiterate our call for Evan's immediate release. 04:51 , Arpan Rai Vladimir Putin is again helping the Wagner Group of mercenaries by providing arms and ammunition along with political recognition after the conventional Russian military forces failed to meet a 1 April deadline to capture Luhansk and Donetsk, experts monitoring the war said. Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin is seemingly regaining some favour with Russian president Vladimir Putin, likely as a result of the Russian conventional military's inability to accomplish the tasks Putin had set for it during the winter offensive in Donbas, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the Russian offensive in Ukraine. It added that the Wagner forces are likely receiving reinforcements, ammunition, and political recognition - which is a stark deviation from the Kremlin's previous efforts to expend Wagner forces and Prigozhin in Bakhmut since at least January 2023. On the battle field, Wagner has been asked to train mobilised personnel to reinforce Wagner's positions in Bakhmut. Prigozhin also confirmed that Russian airborne forces (VDV) are operating alongside Wagner and indicated that Wagner is actively receiving artillery shells. Prigozhin advocated for Wagner to receive more artillery shells, which indicates that Prigozhin has reestablished his supply of ammunition from the Russian ministry of defence, the US-based think-tank said. The extent of Putin's trust and favour for Prigozhin is unclear at this time, but it is likely that Putin halted the Russian MoD's efforts to avenge Wagner by denying Wagner reinforcements and ammunition, the ISW said. 04:20 , Arpan Rai Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine is readying for a second Ramstein meeting of what he referred to as an anti-war coalition. The first round of Ramstein discussions happened in January this year, which saw defence leaders from across the world gathering at Ramstein Air Base in Germany as they hammered out future military aid to Ukraine. By the way, we are already preparing for another Ramstein meeting. I held preparatory meetings. And we expect solidly grounded decisions that will meet the prospects on the battlefield. Quite ambitious prospects, which we are approaching with all our might. Moreover, we are approaching them not only for ourselves, not only for Ukraine but also for our entire anti-war coalition, Mr Zelensky said. He added: The aggressor must lose. And this is our joint responsibility with our partners - to gain more time for peace, that is, to be as active as possible now in providing weapons and ammunition to speed up our joint victory. Russia is once again holding up Ukrainian grain in the Black Sea and blocking the grains onboard at least 50 ships, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. The European Union will continue facilitating exports through the EU solidarity lanes on Ukraine-EU land borders, the top official said, adding that the route has brought 25 billion tons of grain to the world. This is the second time Russia has been accused of blocking grain shipment from Ukraine after invading the country in February last year. In May last year, satellite images showed two Russian carrier ships loading up mounds of grain in Ukraine even as the global food supplies remained threatened by Moscow's invasion. 03:02 , Reuters Moldova has warned Russian politicians not to meddle in its internal affairs, after barring a Russian delegation from entering the country ahead of a regional election. The delegation led by Rustam Minnikhanov, governor of Russia's Tatarstan region, had been due to attend a forum in semi-autonomous Gagauzia region, which holds elections on 30 April to name the head of its government. Moldova, which applied to join the European Union last year alongside its neighbour Ukraine, has repeatedly accused Russia of trying to destabilise the country, something Moscow denies. Mr Minnikhanov arrived in an official Tatarstan government plane but was not allowed off the aircraft. Police said in a statement his trip aimed to bolster support for a pro-Russian candidate standing at the elections. Supporting a candidate at local elections in Moldova is not a valid reason and the authorities ask Russian bureaucrats to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of our country, the border guard service said. 01:53 , Andy Gregory Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has claimed during a visit to Brazil that Moscow wants its war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible. At a news conference with his Brazilian counterpart Mauro Vieira, Mr Lavrov thanked Brazil for its understanding of the genesis of the situation in Ukraine and said Russia had an interest in the conflict ending as soon as possible. Russia has repeatedly said that any settlement of the conflict must acknowledge the realities of its unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions, which its armed forces partly control. Tuesday 18 April 2023 00:41 , PA British nationals are not safe in Russia, a senior MP has warned, after a British-Russian opposition leader was jailed for 25 years by a Moscow court. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, urged the government to call any British nationals living in Russia home. She described the sentencing of outspoken Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza as a farce and said ministers should be working to get him out. New Zealand premier Chris Hipkins has announced he will attend the upcoming Nato summit in July, while Australia's leader said he was still considering whether to travel. Both countries have a decades-long relationship with the military alliance which has taken on greater importance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with both attending last year's summit in Madrid as non-member participants. Mr Hipkins said he would seek to advance a trade agreement with the European Union while at the July summit in Vilnius. Local media previously reported that Australia's Anthony Albanese would not travel to the summit, but he told ABC on Monday that no decision had been made, adding: I have not had a chance yet to talk to the Nato secretary general ... I will give it consideration. I attended last year in Madrid and subject to logistical arrangements, then I would be very pleased to accept the invitation. Monday 17 April 2023 21:51 , Andy Gregory Russia's foreign minster has thanked Brazil for its efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine ahead of a visit with president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose remarks on Vladimir Putin's war have unnerved Washington. Sergei Lavrov and Brazil's foreign relations minister Mauro Vieira addressed journalists after a meeting in Brasilia, discussing plans to boost meat exports to Russia and secure fertiliser imports for Brazilian farmers. Mr Lavrov will meet later on Monday with Lula, who has proposed forming a group of nations not involved in the Russia-Ukraine war to broker peace and discussed the matter in China with counterpart Xi Jinping last weekend. The United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace, Lula said upon his return. We are trying to build a group of countries without any involvement in the war, that do not want the war and defend world peace to have a discussion with both Russia and Ukraine, he said in separate remarks to journalists. But we also have to talk to the United States and European Union. That is, we have to convince people that peace is the way. Monday 17 April 2023 21:04 , Andy Gregory Though it remains unchallenged for now, the United States cannot take the US dollar's continued role as the go-to currency for world trade for granted, the president of the European Central Bank has warned. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Christine Lagarde warned that a more splintered and less efficient world economy will make it harder for central banks to contain inflation. Her speech comes as China, Russia and other countries seek to wean themselves off dependence on the US, which has sought to use its dominance to impose sanctions, most notably on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine last year. Lagarde: US-China split may weaken growth and fuel inflation Monday 17 April 2023 20:14 , Andy Gregory The wife of a British-Russian opposition leader jailed for 25 years has said she is baffled that those involved in his trial have not yet been sanctioned by the UK. Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to prison by a court in Moscow after he was convicted of treason and denigrating the Russian military in proceedings the Kremlin critic called a show trial. The dissident's wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, said that while she was grateful for the support of the Foreign Office, which has condemned the decision, she feels the UK should do more. I would very much like to see the British Government actually doing something in Vladimir's case, Ms Kara-Murza said. I would like to see the British Government introduce sanctions against the violators of my husband's rights. Canada has already introduced sanctions even though he is not a Canadian citizen, as have the US and Latvia. She added: I know that the UK authorities have had a list of the violators for months, so I am honestly baffled that these sanctions have not been introduced. Monday 17 April 2023 19:33 , Andy Gregory Ukrainian infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov will visit Turkey on Tuesday to discuss the status of a deal that allows the safe wartime export of grain from several Ukrainian Black Sea ports, the Turkish defence ministry said on Monday. Kubrakov will meet Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar in the central Turkish city of Kayseri, a ministry statement said. The UN-brokered Black Sea grain export deal was renewed for 60 days last month, but Russia has been signalling it may not agree to extend it further unless the West removes obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertiliser. Ukraine said on Monday the grain accord was in danger of shutdown after Russia blocked inspections of participating ships in Turkish waters. Ukrainian Black Sea ports were blockaded after Russia's invasion last year, but access to three of them was cleared last July under a deal engineered by the United Nations and Turkey. Kubrakov will visit at the invitation of Akar, the ministry statement said, adding that ministers will discuss several bilateral issues including the Black Sea grain initiative. Monday 17 April 2023 18:47 , Andy Gregory The Wagner mercenary group has captured two districts in the centre and northwest of Bakhmut, Russia's Defence Ministry claimed today. Bloody battles unprecedented in recent decades are taking place in the middle of the city's urban area, Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern military command said on Saturday. Our soldiers are doing everything in bloody and fierce battles to grind down the enemy's combat capability and break its morale. Every day, in every corner of this city, they are successfully doing so, he told the 11 television channel. Volodymyr Zelensky's forces have clung on in the frontline city in a seemingly successful bid to inflict heavy losses on Vladimir Putin's armies, but Britain's Ministry of Defence warned on Friday that Ukraine had been forced to concede some ground after being bombarded with particularly intense artillery fire last week. Russia's attack on the Donetsk city has been re-energised, amid greater cooperation between troops with Moscow's defence ministry and the Wagner mercenary group, the ministry said, citing UK intelligence. Ukrainian forces face significant resupply issues but have made orderly withdrawals from the positions they have been forced to concede, it added. Monday 17 April 2023 18:00 , William Mata Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will appeal on Tuesday against his arrest and detention in Moscow's most notorious former KGB prison on charges of espionage, according to court documents - Reuters has said. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 30 it had detained Gershkovich in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and had opened an espionage case against him for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military industrial complex. Gershkovich, the first American journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, and the Journal have denied he was involved in espionage, as has the United States. According to a public Russian judicial document, Lefortovo District",0,,,Vladimir Putin has visited military headquarters in Russia-controlled Kherson. Discussed the war with a general from Moscow's airborne troops. The general has reportedly taken up a powerful new role in the invasion. It comes as reports suggest French president Emmanuel Macron is working on a set of secret plans with China which could bring an end to Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Mr Macron has reportedly deployed his foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne to work in tandem with China's top diplomat Wang Yi.

Protesters clashed with police in the Greek capital Athens after a passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided with a freight train on Tuesday evening in Tempi, near the city of Larissa, leaving at least 46 people dead and scores injured. The death toll is expected to rise. The Greek transport minister resigned in the wake of the tragedy, while a rail workers union is going on strike, accusing the government of disrespect in the sector. Another 52 people remain in hospital as a result of the crash, which left toppled carriages and scorched debris in its wake. Six of the injured being treated are in critical condition due to head wounds and serious burns, state-owned public broadcaster ERT reported Thursday. Most of the passengers involved in the accident were young, a local hospital told ERT. The accident came soon after a holiday weekend. The identification process of the dead is ongoing alongside recovery efforts involving firefighters and ambulance workers, with the focus on the first carriages of the passenger train, Greek authorities said.

Vasilis VerveridisEurokinissimotionteamAFPGetty Images 'Pain has turned into anger' Greece has a weak record of railway passenger safety compared with other countries in Europe, recording the highest railway fatality rate per million train kilometers from 2018 to 2020 among 28 nations on the continent, according to a 2022 report from the European Union Agency for Railways. In an extraordinary meeting, the Greek federation of rail workers decided unanimously to launch the 24-hour strike on Thursday to highlight poor working conditions and chronic understaffing. It accused the federal government of disrespect towards railways for causing the tragic crash, saying more permanent staff, better training and mainly the implementation of modern security systems, are permanently thrown in the bin. Separately, another 24-hour strike was announced by Greek metro workers, who said in a statement: There are no words to describe such tragedy. Greek transport minister Kostas Karamanlis said the railway system the government inherited was not up to 21st century standards as he stepped down from his role Wednesday. In a televised address after visiting the crash site, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the collision was mainly due to tragic human error. He said the transport minister's decision to resign was honorable, and added that the heads of Hellenic Railways Organization and its subsidiary ERGOSE have also submitted their resignations.

The loudest and most disruptive sounds come from military sonar, oil exploration and industrial shipping. These sounds are proven to disorientate and harm marine mammals, fish, turtles, invertebrates and cephalopods, who all use sound to communicate, find their way and hunt. In Cartagena Port in southern Spain, maritime traffic is the primary source of continuous noise, and it is officially an 'underwater noise pollution area'. Part of this traffic also crosses a Special Area of Conservation spanning 154 082 hectares, an area around the size of London. 'We want to reduce the impact these sounds have on the marine environment both in the port and beyond it', says LIFE PortSounds project coordinator Javier Muoz Bozzo. Finding the sources of the noise Project partners are mapping and assessing the influence of marine traffic and the impact of the resulting underwater noise on biodiversity. In particular, the team is monitoring the abundance, distribution and physiological state of three six cetacean species: the bottlenose dolphin, pilot whale and striped dolphin. Around 200 cetaceans have already been observed; definitive results will come at the end of 2023. They are also developing a tool to recover data from specially placed hydrophones. This data will help them make predictive scenarios to identify the noise sources and introduce measures to deal with the vessels that may interfere with biodiversity. 'We will assess whether the proposed mitigation measures will improve the conservation status of the three species while boosting their populations and reproductive rates,' adds Mr Muoz Bozzo. Introducing a speed limit The project team is developing and implementing noise mitigation measures to benefit the species. For example, as a port authority, they can regulate the speed of vessels. To this end, they plan to cut the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) by up to 10 dB by reducing the average speed of large ships from 20 to 10 knots. This speed limit should lessen average continuous noise to levels that do not impact the three cetacean species. It is also expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions. A working group will regularly assess the mitigation measures and adapt as necessary. The project hopes to apply the project's mitigation measures and noise management tool to other port authorities.

An RDG spokesman said: The RMT leadership's decision to put Network Rail's deal to its membership is a welcome development, but train operating staff will rightly be asking why their union continues to deny them the opportunity to have their say on our equivalent offer. Instead of inflicting more lost pay on its members and disruption to our passengers, we are calling on the union to call off their strikes and meet us for urgent talks to resolve this dispute. The RDG said its offer includes pay rises of at least 5 for 2022 and 4 for this year, with a lump sum payment for last year's increase. The Government and the rail industry insist reforms to working practices are needed to afford higher salaries as the sector's finances have been badly affected by the drop in passengers caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Ministry of Railways reveal,"The Ministry of Railways tweeted what the 'X' on the back of a train denotes. (Image: RailMinIndiaTwitter) The Ministry of Railways has answered a 'Did you know?' nugget about trains on Twitter today. For those wondering what the 'X' mark on the back of the train means, the Ministry has an explanation. Did you know? The letter 'X' on the last coach of the train denotes that the train has passed without any coaches being left behind, the ministry wrote with a photo of the sign on the train. The letter 'X' denotes that it is the train's last coach. Railway officials get a confirmation that a train has passed in its entirety without any coaches being left behind, the picture reads. Indian Railways is one of the largest railway networks in the world and is owned and operated by the government of India and was established in 1853 by the British colonial government. The first railway line in India was built between Mumbai (then Bombay) and Thane in 1853, covering a distance of 34 kilometers. This line was later extended to cover other parts of the country, and by the early 20th century, the Indian railway network had become the largest employer in the country. During the early days, the Indian Railways faced several challenges, including a lack of resources, technical expertise, and political opposition. However, the network continued to expand and improve, and by the 1940s, it had become a crucial part of India's transportation infrastructure. In the decades following independence, Indian Railways underwent significant modernization and expansion, with the introduction of new technologies, electrification of tracks, and the construction of new lines and stations. Today, Indian Railways is a major contributor to the country's economy, providing employment to millions of people and connecting various regions of India.",0,,,"The letter 'X' on the last coach of the train denotes that the train has passed without any coaches being left behind.

Under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) investment scheme, Beijing has invested billions of dollars in Pakistan since 2015. Despite continued threats from Pakistani militants, private companies have flocked to the border to undertake contracts for large-scale infrastructure initiatives. According to the police, a warehouse complex for the Dasu hydropower project in the Kohistan district of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, located 180 kilometers (110 miles) north of Islamabad, was destroyed in a pre-dawn blaze on Tuesday. It was a huge fire, stated a Rescue 1122 official who was present at the scene. Initially, the flames were very high and we had to call for fire brigade vehicles from two other districts. It was quite a big storehouse, and apart from oil drums, stationery and machinery were also stockpiled there. That is all been destroyed in the fire, he told AFP. The construction of the Dasu dam was assigned to China Gezhouba Group Company by Pakistan's water ministry in 2017. The camp was occupied by Chinese engineers, surveyors, and mechanics; however, neither police nor Rescue 1122 reported any casualties. An electrical malfunction is suspected to have triggered the fire, as per a police official's statement. Earlier in July 2021, a bus carrying employees to the Dasu site was bombed, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals, including nine Chinese laborers, with Beijing claiming it was an intentional attack. Islamabad initially attributed the explosion to a gas leak, but security measures at the location were significantly increased following the incident. Despite the close economic relations between China and Pakistan, the security of Chinese workers in Pakistan has been a persistent concern for Beijing, as militants who oppose foreign influence often target Chinese nationals. Following the Taliban's return to power in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan has witnessed a significant increase in militant attacks in its western regions, which coincidentally are the same areas where China is concentrating its investments.",0,,,"A fire engulfed the camp of a Chinese company responsible for overseeing the construction of a remote hydropower dam in north-western Pakistan.

The FAA told The Hill that the pilot of a Learjet 60 took off without clearance at Boston's Logan International Airport at the same time that JetBlue Flight 206 was preparing to land on an intersecting runway, according to a preliminary review by the department. The agency said the incident occurred right before 7 p.m. on Monday, when an air traffic controller instructed the pilot of the Learjet to wait on the runway while the JetBlue jet landed on an intersecting runway. Instead, the pilot of the LearJet began a takeoff roll, causing the JetBlue airliner to take evasive action. The Learjet was operated by a private charter company, Hop-A-Jet, according to the FAA. The FAA will work to determine exactly how close the two jets came to each other. The incident in Boston follows a similar close call in Texas earlier this month -- an event that is also under investigation.

They are describing the rescue as a frantic effort involving no less than three ships which had responded to a mayday call. At 0100 local time, the MRCC Cape Town received a radio call from the crew of the fishing vessel Olivia Marie reporting that their 105-foot ship was on fire. The vessel registered in South Africa shows according to its AIS data that it had departed Hout Bay, south of Cape Town, on April 5. The MRCC reports that the crew said they were abandoning ship after the fire had begun in the engine room and that the whole vessel was now ablaze. The fire was said to be spreading quickly. The crew was getting into a small life raft despite strong winds and high seas and urgently requesting assistance. Several vessels were in the area and the MRCC coordinated with them to organize the rescue. A Liberian registered bulk carrier, AquaExplore (179,000 dwt) was inbound toward St. Helena Bay Anchorage and diverted. She was the first on the scene but SAMSA reports the vessel was unable to recover the fishing boat crew from the raft. The bulker however remained on-scene. Next to arrive was a smaller fishing boat, the 62-foot Umfondini, also registered in South Africa and operating out of neighboring Gordons Bay. The vessel was able to rescue the crewmembers from their raft. It left the raft and burning fishing boat heading for shore with the crew. All crew were safely transferred to the Umfondini with the prevailing winds reported to be South-westerly at 15 knots and a water swell of up to 2.6 meters (approximately 8.5 feet). The AquaExplore proceeded with its normal voyage, with the bulker arriving at its destination later in the day reports SAMSA. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), a volunteer lifesaving organization, also put a boat out to assist with the effort. The rescue boat was able to rendezvous with the fishing vessel with the crew from the burning ship. They transferred the crew to the NSRI Simon's Town craft. The rescue boat brought the crew back to their station and arranged for them to be transported back to Hout Bay. SAMSA is also issuing a navigation warning asking vessels in the area both to proceed with caution and to also report any sightings of the drifting fishing boat and its life raft. A third fishing boat, Langenberg, spotted the wreck of the Olivia Marie seen drifting approximately 3.5 nautical miles from its original position with the force 5 winds pushing the wreck toward shallow waters. SAMSA is also warning that some debris has been spotted in the water along with the drifting life raft. They are requesting assistance in the recovery of the Olivia Marie and its lift raft. Efforts are continuing to salvage the abandoned vessel.",1,,,"Fishing vessel Olivia Marie caught fire overnight south of Cape of Good Hope near Cape Town. 26 crewmembers were rescued and brought to shore.
