Losses were said to be millions of dollars. A report said apart from the warehouse, one truck two forklifts, a concrete mixer and other machines were destroyed. Owner of the Pallet and Brick Factory claimed fire officers from the Sangre Grande Fire Station took more than an hour to respond and when they arrived they went into the compound of XTRA Foods. I had to go across to XTRA Foods and tell the fire officer the fire is next door, he claimed. He said by the time the fire officers arrived on his compound on Eastern Main Road Turure, Sangre Grande, the entire warehouse and one house was engulfed in flames. However, the officers contained the fire from spreading to nearby houses with the assistance of fire appliances from Arima. Alix Ramdass Sand and Gravel Company Limited supplied portable water to the fire tenders. Sampson said the fire began around 11.45 am. He was unable to say how it started. He used to supply pallets to AS Bryden and Sons. The fire has left eight employees out of a job. Asked if his company was insured he said I cannot say yes or no, I have to ask my sister. All I know is that the damage will run into millions. Natasha Hamilton, a mother of two and single parent whose house was destroyed in the fire, said everything was burnt. She said school books and uniforms belonging to her children who attend North Eastern College and Guaico Government Primary respectively, were also destroyed. She is now appealing for assistance. I am traumatised as well as my two children. Family members have pledged to give lodging but cannot say for how long, she said. The fire officers said they had no water problem, but by the time they arrived at the warehouse it was already engulfed in flames and the best thing they could have done was to contain the fire from spreading to nearby houses.

The latest action follows a port pilots' strike, which ended this morning, and disruption in France as demonstrators protest against the president's plan to reduce the pensionable age. Stefan Genth, CEO of the HDE retail association, called on the German government to lift the Sunday driving ban this weekend to allow logistics firms to bring forward some shipments and avoid supply chaos. Leader of the EVG union Martin Burkert said industrial action was a sharp sword that we also handle very responsibly. Pointing to the fact that Germany has few strike days compared with other countries. Mr Burkert said the dispute pursued by EVG and the Ver.di union centred on demands for pay and collective agreements. Monaco-based website Connexion is reporting that some refineries in France have been affected by the disputes, with some regions limiting fuel sales, and some flights lost due to air traffic controller disruption. Yesterday's protests in France caused disruption to freight, according to ferry operator DFDS. Director Chris Parker told The Loadstar: We have had some instances where customers' journeys have been affected when protesters block the roads. We are monitoring the situation closely and contacting freight and passenger customers with advice about what is open and what is not. At the moment, we do not have issues on any of our routes. While PO Ferries also reported no issues and advised freight operators that should disruptions occur, it would advise customers via Twitter and by text. In the UK, a port of Dover spokeperson advised: The port is still open, with minimal disruption expected.

Hundreds of schools closed in the first strike by members of the National Education Union on February 1. Councils admit the full picture of school closures will not be known until the day of the strike but have begun to publish lists. Parents are being advised to contact their child's school and check media and schools' social media for the latest up-to-date information Union members initially suspended further strikes while talks continued with the Welsh Government but then rejected a new pay offer from education minister Jeremy Miles and will now strike again on March 2. Two further strike days are planned for March 15 and 16. Read more: Wales faces massive shortage of specialist physics and chemistry teachers The renewed offer would have given teachers a further 1.5 pay rise plus a one-off cash bonus also equivalent to 1.5 of a teacher's salary in addition to the initial 5 pay offer. Union members said that was just not good enough and you can read more details of that here. Some local education authorities have published lists of schools they know will shut when teachers walk out on Thursday, March 2, but have conceded there may be more and those lists are likely to change. Councils said they will not know until the day of the strike which schools will be running normally or not. Staff do not have to tell head teachers if they plan to walk out so the full situation will not be clear until then. A work to rule by school leaders, who have also rejected the new offer on grounds it does not address working conditions, means heads will not provide cover for striking teachers. Online learning will not be provided Cllr Phil Wynn, lead member for education at Wrexham Council, summed up the situation across Wales and said: We understand parents' concerns as there will inevitably be disruption on Thursday, March 2, and we are working with schools to manage this in the best way possible. The full extent of the industrial action, however, will not be known until the day itself. Members of the NEU will take their protest to the Senedd on March 2 with a strike day rally from 11.45am. Joint general secretary Mary Bousted will speak at the rally expected to be attended by hundreds of striking teachers. The strike coincides with teacher strikes in England and head teachers and school leaders who are members of the National Association of Headteachers Cymru have also rejected the latest offer. Members of the NAHT Cymru said the renewed pay offer from the Welsh Government was too vague and did not address their concerns over workload. The heads' work to rule means tasks they will not do include providing cover for striking teachers or information on who is striking. They will also restrict their availability to receive or respond to calls and emails before 9am or after 3pm.

So far three schools have confirmed they will shut, 12 will be partially shut, and four have said they will be fully open. The situation for all other schools in the county are not known and the council did not name those that would be shut, partially shut, or open. Conwy The council warned the full impact will not be known until strike day but as of last thing on Monday, February 27, it has been told 11 of its 63 schools will be shut, 16 partially shut, 16 open, and the impact on the rest was not known. The council said in a statement: Decisions on whether to close schools during industrial action have been taken by the head teacher of a school following a risk assessment. Schools have contacted parentscarers direct with information specific to local circumstances. The education service is advising parentscarers to follow the information provided by their child's school. We are awaiting information from 20 schools.

As a local education authority we have met with the heads of the county's primary, secondary, and special schools in order to prepare and discuss the main issues that may arise. The impact of the strike will vary from school to school. We sympathise with the concern this may cause for pupils and their families and we are working closely with our schools so that they can provide appropriate and consistent information to parents and pupils in advance. The full extent of the industrial action cannot be known until the day itself. As a council we are committed to working with the Welsh Government and the unions to resolve this dispute and to ensure that any action disrupts as little as possible on the provision of education in the county. Wrexham Cllr Phil Wynn, lead member for education, said: We understand parents' concerns as there will inevitably be disruption on Thursday, March 2, and we are working with schools to manage this in the best way possible. The full extent of the industrial action, however, will not be known until the day itself. Head teachers are preparing risk assessments based on the information they have in order to assist them in making a decision on whether or not to close, partially close, or remain open. They will endeavour to give as much notice as possible to parents. Parents are advised to look out for communications from their child's school and to take the necessary action. Anglesey A council spokesman said: We are liaising with head teachers to assess how the latest industrial action will affect our schools on March 2. Assessing the impact of the industrial action is, of course, hampered by the fact that teachers do not have to inform their head teacher that they are unavailable for work until the morning of March 2. However we will continue to work with schools to ensure that we have as clear a picture as possible. Schools will be informing parents directly with regards to their intention as soon as they are able to. Flintshire A council spokesman said: The full extent of the industrial action will not be known until the day itself. We advise parents to look out for communications from their child's school directly and to take the necessary action. Elsewhere Wales' two largest local education authorities, Cardiff and Swansea, said they could not give any details of school closures until nearer the time. In the last strike most schools in both cities shut. NEU members said they are striking to save education which faces a teacher recruitment and retainment crisis after years of pay erosion and increased workload. Teachers are leaving the profession for better-paid jobs, the union said. Schools across Wales have reported difficulty recruiting in core subjects such as maths and English as well as the sciences. NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: The offer of an additional 1.5 added to teachers pay, plus an additional 1.5 lump-sum, is simply not good enough and fails to address either the cost of living crisis, spiralling inflation, nor the damage done to pay since 2010. We have a clear mandate for strike action that is now rescheduled for March 2 in schools across Wales. Nasuwt Cymru has also now rejected the new pay offer with that union warning it is committed to a further industrial action ballot of members in Wales unless there is an improved offer. A ballot of members after the first pay offer of 5 did not get enough votes across the threshold for a strike at that time.

There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Only 2017, with 503 tornado reports, and 2008, with 523, had more at this point in the year. Pinning down how tornado activity will change in a warming world -- if at all -- is an active area of research, and more data is needed. But a picture is emerging of how risks are changing across parts of the country, particularly in areas where social factors compound vulnerabilities to extreme weather. This year's active start can be blamed, at least in part, on the mild winter conditions experienced across much of the country, said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Severe Storms Laboratory. Warmer-than-usual winters create the type of atmospheric instability in early spring that is a key ingredient for severe storms, including those that spin up tornadoes. If you do not get the cold fronts across the Gulf, all you need is a little bit of wind to bring in a lot of warm, moist air, Brooks said. And this has been a year where cold fronts really have not gotten that far south. The southern part of the YOU.S. was not particularly cold this winter. This dynamic is why tornadoes in the South occur more commonly in the cooler months, from late fall through winter and into early spring. It is also why this part of the country may become more vulnerable as the world warms. A study published last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that supercell storms, which can produce violent tornadoes, will increase as the world warms. These storms are also projected to hit Southern states like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee more frequently in the future, according to the research.",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/tornado-season-2023-strong-start-rcna78394,0,"There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday.

According to the McCown report, which covers the top ten US container ports, import throughput last month fell a record 28, to 1,454,438 teu, the lowest level since March 2020, as extremely weak demand was exacerbated by the Chinese New Year falling ten days earlier than last year. Meanwhile, imports at US east and Gulf coast ports declined 18.7, to 809,375 teu, with only the port of Houston recording an increase, 12.7 year on year, to 141,946 teu. The west coast ports were also impacted by the continued coastal shift to the east and the unresolved west coast labour situation. The port of Los Angeles saw a startling 41.2 collapse in container imports, to 249,407 teu, demoting it to third in the import rankings behind New YorkNew Jersey, with 280,652 teu, and San Pedro Bay neighbour Long Beach's 254,970 teu. During a cargo news briefing on Friday, LA's executive director, Gene Seroka, said vessel calls in February were down to 61, compared with 93 in the same month of last year, and no fewer than 30 blanked sailings in the month. The demand is just not there, he said. US warehouses remain largely full, retailers must clear inventory levels before the next wave of imports arrive, but with the economy on everybody's mind and consumers continuing to feel the pinch of inflation, older inventories are simply not moving fast enough. All this, he added, amid reports in the US media of retailers deciding to destroy stock they could not shift even with heavy discounting. Mr Seroka said that while he expected March volumes to be better, throughput would be around a third down, quarter on quarter, and would remain lighter than average in the first half of 2023. Indeed, McCown report three-month data is now showing a 21 decline in import volumes, a further decrease on the 17.2 negative of last month. And there was further evidence of the global slowdown in the big drop in empty equipment being shipped back to Asia, with the port of Los Angeles processing 156,035 teu for export during the month, versus 338,251 teu the previous year. Nevertheless, Mr Seroka said, there was some reason for optimism from its close monitoring of purchase orders - which he explained typically convert to shipments from Asia 90 to 100 days later. We are starting to see a little bit of an uptick in the middle of the year, he said. Meanwhile, US exports continued their recent gains, recording an overall 4.6 increase to 789,037 teu in February, for a trailing three-month gain of 8.7. According to the McCown report, the ports with the strongest export performance in February were Houston, up 41.7 to 116,265 teu, Charleston, up 12.2 to 61,448 teu, and Norfolk, up 8.8 to 96,399 teu. Los Angeles was the weakest, with a loss of 13.7, to 82,404 teu, followed by Oakland, with a drop of 9.4, to 56,475 teu.",https://theloadstar.com/west-coast-ports-suffering-as-us-container-imports-plunge-by-37/,0,"US container imports in February were massively down from the highs of the previous year.

Judge John Hughes adjourned the case for the directions of the DPP to be given. Mr Guzauskas, of Ridgewood Close, Swords, Co Dublin, is charged with one offence under Section 43 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988. He is accused of knowingly causing a false alarm by flying an unmanned aerial system (drone) into the critical area of Dublin Airport which interfered with the operation of an aerodrome. The offence is alleged to have happened at Naul Road on July 2, 2022. Garda Paul Murphy told Judge Hughes he arrested the accused at Dublin Airport garda station at 2.57pm today for the purpose of charge. He was charged at 4.08pm and made no reply after caution. The accused was handed a copy of the charge sheet, the garda said. He had no objection to bail subject to conditions. Asked how far Mr Guzauskas lived from the airport, the garda said it was 2km as the crow flies but further to drive. The judge also asked if the accused had any upcoming reason to be near the airport. Defence solicitor Donal Quigley said his client would be flying from the airport for a holiday in July. Judge Hughes granted bail in the accused's own bond of 500, with no cash lodgement or surety required. Under conditions, Mr Guzauskas is prohibited from owning or flying a drone at any time, for any reason anywhere within the state, and is not to take part in any way in the operation of a drone. He must not attend within 2km of Dublin Airport without the consent of the garda. He is to reside at the address on the charge sheet and notify gardai of any proposed change of address. Mr Guzauskas must submit a phone number at which he is contactable 24 hours per day. He is also to surrender passport within 24 hours, undertake not to apply for any other travel documents and not leave the state without permission. The judge granted free legal aid after hearing the accused was a separated father-of-two and worked for a removal company. Gda Murphy said the DPP had given preliminary directions to charge Mr Guzauskas and sought an adjournment for an investigation file to be sent. The case was adjourned to March 21. Mr Guzauskas has not yet indicated how he intends to plead to the charge. The accused is the second person to appear before the court in recent weeks on a charge related to drone-flying near the airport. Earlier this month, Eric Brills (50) of Holywell Dale, Swords, was charged with flying a drone in a critical area close to Dublin Airport, which was likely to interfere with the safety of aircraft in flight. Mr Brills' charge was under Section 3 of the same Act and followed an incident on January 24 this year. That case, which has also been adjourned, was unrelated to Mr Guzauskas's charge.",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/man-caused-false-alarm-by-flying-drone-into-critical-area-at-dublin-airport-court-told-42353262.html,1,"Ainis Guzauskas (41) is charged with one offence under the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988.

Passengers spent 16 hours on a plane only to return to their departure point because of a fire at the destination airport. An Air New Zealand flight bound for New York on Thursday was forced to make a YOU-turn and head back to Auckland Airport in New Zealand because of an electrical fire in Terminal 1 at JFK Airport, an airline spokesperson told Insider. JFK Airport said on Twitter that an electrical panel failure in the terminal caused a power outage, as well as a small isolated fire, which was extinguished straight away. The incident meant that inbound and outbound flights were affected, the airport tweeted on Thursday. Terminal 1 was closed on Thursday and remained shut on Friday because of electrical issues, per tweets by JFK Airport. The Port Authority was working with airport operators to restore flight operations as soon as possible, the tweets said. The Air New Zealand flight turned back over the Pacific Ocean, almost halfway between New Zealand and the US West coast, according to tracking site FlightAware. The Air New Zealand spokesperson said the airline apologized for the disruption caused. Diverting to another US port would have meant the aircraft would remain on the ground for several days, impacting a number of other scheduled services and customers, the spokesperson said. Passengers were rebooked onto the next available flight to JFK Airport, the spokesperson added. JFK Airport did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The power outage at JFK Airport also caused other flights to divert to their departure airports on Thursday. These included two ITA Airways flights from Milan and Rome, and a Korean Air flight from Seoul, per FlightAware. Flights to nowhere can occur when an aircraft is unable to land at its destination. Passengers on an Emirates flight in January took a 13-hour trip to nowhere because of heavy rain and major flooding at Auckland International Airport, meaning the plane could not land.

Delta Air Lines Inc and EasyJet Plc are among airlines joining forces with KLM, which accounts for close to 60 of traffic at Schiphol, to safeguard the future capacity of the airport, according to a joint statement published on Friday. The Dutch government announced last year it is planning cut the Amsterdam hub's flight capacity in a bid to reduce noise pollution. The cabinet will impose a limit of 460,000 flights this year with the ultimate goal of reducing the capacity to 440,000 by 2024. ALSO READ: Air France-KLM sees robust bookings after better-than-expected Q4 The brewing confrontation comes amid increasingly tense relationship between airports and airlines. Last year, traffic across hubs in Europe endured chaotic weeks of disruption because of a lack of ground personnel, forcing airlines to cut capacity. KLM said earlier this month that operations last year were held back as a result of the disruptions at Schiphol. Amsterdam's Schiphol airport lost 28 million last year despite what it called a strong recovery in traffic, and the hub's efforts to mitigate the chaos led to additional costs of about 120 million, it said. KLM said the government's decision to cut back operations is unnecessary and violates national, European and international legislation.

So far, the fire is believed contained in the aft end of the vessel not reaching its cargo of jet fuel and diesel and there has not been an oil leak. However, the fire is continuing to burn with spectators along the shoreline posting photos of the burning ship which is less than two miles from the coast. The tanker Greta K (24,768 dwt) was inbound for the port of Leixes, having already boarded her pilot when the fire was reported around 3:30 p.m. Marinha Portuguesa is monitoring the situation reporting that Port Authority was able to quickly send three tugboats to the vessel. In addition, the Port Captain for Douro and Leixes sent two additional tugboats to assist. They have evacuated 12 of the 19 Filipino crewmembers aboard the vessel. The other seven have remained aboard to assist in the firefight. Local media is reporting that the fire was contained at the stern and suspected to have started in the engine room. Black smoke is seen billowing from the stern. The fireboats are spraying water on the aft sections of the ship while others were assigned to cool the tops of the cargo tanks. The teams are concerned that there could be a secondary ignition and trying to prevent the fire from reaching the cargo. There is no crude aboard, but they have not yet reported how much fuel the vessel is carrying or the volume of cargo aboard. The Greta K is registered in Malta.

At least 900,000 barrels per day (BBLd) of France's 1.15 million BBLd refinery capacity is offline due to strike action. This has a supporting impact on refined product prices and a weakening impact on regional crude prices, said Hillary Stevenson, Senior Director, Energy Market Intelligence for Industrial Info. Operations at all but one of the six operational oil refineries in France have been impacted by the strikes. TotalEnergies SE's (NYSE:TTE) (Courbevoie, France) 119,000-BBLd Feyzin Refinery was running at half capacity. Previously, the European Union's embargo on Russian oil products went into effect on February 5. Ahead of the sanctions, European gasoil (diesel) stocks increased in preparation for the shutoff of Russian supplies, hitting a 15-month high at the beginning of the year, according to consultancy Insights Global (Breda, Netherlands). Gasoil stocks declined last week, according to the consultancy, but stocks remained higher year on year, as Europe is going through stocks built up before 5 February. The French strikes remain a going concern for the market's supply... Strikes at French refineries have cut deeply into France's refined products output, including gasoil. The strikes were staged in protest to an increase in the retirement age in France. Stevenson said Exxon Mobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) (Irving, Texas) 191,000-BBLd Esso Refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, is undergoing a plantwide turnaround outage until mid-May, thus exacerbating the fuel situation in Europe. While the prices of other oil-based commodities have declined in recent days due to banking-related market woes, the price of gasoil has remained stable, Stevenson noted. However, she said, gasoil supplies in Europe are about to get very tight due to the refinery strike in France and the planned refinery outage in the Netherlands.

When Britain opted to leave the EU customs union, French officials began thoroughly checking the passports of British travelers, much as they would check the documents of any foreign nationals arriving from third countries. That manual process has had an impact on the throughput rate for cross-channel passenger transport, according to the Port of Dover, contributing to delays during surges in travel activity. This occurred over the weekend as thousands of Britons headed to Europe by bus and ferry for their spring break vacations. The Port of Dover declared a state of emergency when a combination of bad weather, higher-than-expected traffic volume and customs delays on the French side led to some passenger buses experiencing a wait of up to 18 hours. Port officials at Dover cited lengthy French border processes and sheer volume for the delays. In an interview on Sky News on Sunday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman played down the disruption as a weather event. I do not think it is fair to say that this is an adverse effect of Brexit . . . We have had many years now since leaving the EU, and there is been, on the whole, very good operations and processes at the border, she said. Braverman was a leading proponent of the Brexit Leave campaign in the run-up to the referendum in 2016, and continued to run on delivering Brexit opportunities in the Tories' leadership contest last year. On Monday, a spokesman for the administration of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak allowed that passport controls played a role in the delay. We recognize there are new processes in place - that is why authorities were given a long time to prepare for the new checks, the spokesman said. And we are in discussion with our French counterparts about how we can further improve the flow of traffic. Another pro-Brexit leader, former Brexit transition negotiator Lord Frost, admitted in a statement Monday that since Brexit the processes have got a bit more laborious. If we want to control movement into the UK . . . then we must expect the EU to control movement into the EU. We cannot have it both ways and we should be honest about that, he said. This coming November, France will also institute fingerprint and biometric scans for arriving UK nationals, the same protocol it plans to apply to other citizens of third countries.

They were killed when a passenger train, on route from Athens to Thessaloniki with more than 350 people on board -- many of them young students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent -- crashed head-on into a freight train shortly before midnight Tuesday, outside the town of Tempe in central Greece. According to a report on Thursday by public broadcaster ERT, 52 people remain in hospital in Larissa as a result of the crash. Six people are in critical condition due to head wounds and serious burns. Residents in Larissa lined up to give blood, many waiting more than an hour in heavy rain. The rescue and recovery operation is ongoing amid the completely destroyed and crushed rail carriages. Rescuer Konstantinos Imanimidis told Reuters on Thursday, It will be very difficult to find survivors, due to the temperatures caused by fires that developed in the carriages... This is the hardest thing, instead of saving lives we have to dig out bodies. On Wednesday, the government announced three days of national mourning, while asserting that the disaster was, according to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, mainly due to a tragic human error. The station master in Larissa, a worker with over 40 years' experience on the railways, has been arrested. But the attempt to pin the blame on a single individual has been widely rejected, fuelling protests and a rail strike against the New Democracy (ND) conservative government. Workers know that the rail network has suffered years of austerity cuts, including mass job losses. Much of the network, especially in northern Greece, is not automated, relying on manual signalling. The station master was charged Thursday with dangerous disruptions of transportation, and may face charges of manslaughter through negligence, bodily harm through negligence and dangerous interventions in means of transportation. But evidence is already emerging throwing doubt over claims that human error is to blame. Kathimerini reported that when the station master appeared before an investigative magistrate in the town of Larissa Thursday, He allegedly claimed that during his shift he gave an order to change the tracks on the railway network so that the two trains would not move on the same line but that the system apparently did not respond. The newspaper added, This version of events is supported by a photograph from the stationmaster's logbook that shows he instructed the fatal Inter City 62 train to continue its journey to Neos Poros, apparently not knowing that the freight train was moving on the same piece of track right toward it. More evidence points to the catastrophic implications of having sections of the rail system that rely totally on manual intervention, with no implementation of automated rail systems widely used internationally. Kathimerini noted, A colleague reportedly said in an interview with the media that before the fatal accident another train had come to a standstill at Tempe. And that in order to move the stalled train to the nearest station there were changes to the tracks, but the network was not later restored to its previous state. The deaths prompted angry protests in Athens, in Thessaloniki where many of the people who died lived, and in Larissa near to where to crash occurred. In Athens, hundreds of mainly young protesters demonstrated on Wednesday outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train, the privatised company responsible for maintaining Greek railways. They were attacked by riot police, who fired tear gas and stun grenades. Protesters then marched to the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square where police attacked again. In Larissa, a silent vigil to commemorate the victims of the crash was held. Speaking to the AFP news agency, Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, said, The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff. The arrested station master should not pay the price for a whole ailing system. Larissa-based doctor Costas Bargiotas said, This is an inadmissible accident. We have known this situation for 30 years. The BBC reported, Families have given DNA samples to help identification efforts, with the results expected on Thursday. One of those, a woman called Katerina searching for her missing brother, a passenger on the train, shouted 'Murderers!' outside the hospital in Larissa, directing her anger towards the government and the rail company. On Thursday, rail workers in the Federation of Railway Employees began a nationwide 24-hour strike to protest the deaths and the unsafe conditions on Greece's rail network. A statement by the union said, Pain has turned into anger for the dozens of dead and wounded colleagues and fellow citizens. Successive governments, it added, had ignored repeated demands to improve safety standards. The rail network required hiring permanent personnel, better training and, above all, modern safety technology. These proposals had always ended up in the trash can. Lines 2 and 3 of the Athens Metro were also suspended for the duration of the rail workers' action due to a solidarity strike by members of the Athens Metro Workers Union. That evening, striking workers protested outside Hellenic Railway headquarters in Athens, with thousands then marching to Syntagma Square, with young people joining them -- to protest in front of the parliament. The train deaths are the result of social crimes for which every political party of the ruling elite shares responsibility. It is their leaders who should be in the dock facing charges. Under-resourcing and destaffing of an already below standard rail network was acceleratedover the last decade with the privatisation of the state-own railway, TrainOSE, by the pseudo-left SYRIZA government in 2017-18. SYRIZA was brought to power in 2015 on a wave of protests and strikes after five years of savage austerity. They then trampled on this mandate, imposing, as ND and the social democratic PASOK did before them, a devastating austerity programme. The privatisation of key national economic assets and infrastructure was the price demanded in return for any further loans by the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund. SYRIZA carried their instructions out to the letter. TrainOSE was sold off as part of the third austerity package imposed after 2010, with the rail privatisation and sale of other state assets expected to raise 6 billion euros by 2018. It was bought by Ferrovie Dello Stato Italian, the Italian state-owned railway holding company, for just 45 million. SYRIZA's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, at a lavish ceremony in Corfu, presented this as a glorious success. Naftemporiki, the daily financial newspaper, reported, Tsipras explained that the importance of the investment lies in the fact that the country has been spared a great financial burden... in the price itself, but even more so in the size of the investment it will make in the Greek economy, in the Greek railway, amounting to 500 million euros. Tsipras's lies were soon exposed, with the newly privatised firm, renamed Hellenic Railways, making no investments to upgrade the rail network. The reality, as SYRIZA knew well, was that Ferrovie Dello Stato Italian was planning only vast profits. Ferrovie's CEO Renato Mazzoncini described buying TrainOSE as a strategic move for the group. It is not so much about buying a piece of Greece at reduced price, but rather about a strategic expansion operation in view of the major investment in the Athens-Thessaloniki line, which is part of the European corridor project. The European corridor project would be worth about 3 billion, said Mazzoncini. The horrific human cost was confirmed in an EU report last year on Railway Safety and Interoperability in the EU. Greece was the only member state entirely without train protection systems that are widely considered one of the most effective railway safety measures for reducing the risk of collisions between trains. Post-privatization, Greece's rail network is one of the most dangerous in Europe. From 2018 to 2020, according to the European Union Agency for Railways, Greece recorded the highest railway fatality rate per million train kilometres among 28 European nations. On Thursday, the Financial Times reported, Fifteen days before the worst railway crash Greece has seen in decades, the European Commission had referred the country to the European Court of Justice for 'failing to fulfil its obligations' from 2015 to the present day under the Single European Railway Area Directive regarding infrastructure investments and emergency procedures.

Scientists explain how warming climate affects tornado activity,"The mid-South is at a 25 greater risk of tornado threats, an expert said. As the earth's temperature climbs, so does the threat of extreme weather events such as drought, wildfire, hurricanes and tornadoes -- all occurring more frequently at higher strengths, according to climate scientists. More violent and widespread tornado activity -- like the line of severe storms in recent days that killed dozens of people -- is expected in the future as global warming persists, experts told ABC News. At the start of the weekend, a powerful storm system unleashed a line of violent tornadoes across 14 states. At least nine EF3 tornadoes -- wind speeds ranging from 136 to 165 mph -- were confirmed to have touched down in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Delaware on Friday and Saturday. While such events have occurred in the past, the evidence points to climate change contributing to the frequency and magnitude of tornado behavior, Walker Ashley, an atmospheric scientist and disaster geographer at Northern Illinois University, told ABC News. This is a representation of what we might perhaps expect to happen in a particularly active tornado season as we move forward in a warming climate regime, said Jana Houser, associate professor of meteorology at Ohio State University, of the recent deadly tornado activity. Simulations of the atmosphere indicate that, as global temperatures continue to rise, so do the chances that the fundamental ingredients for a severe thunderstorm will be present, Ashley said. With more moisture, atmospheric instability -- the gasoline for storms -- and wind shear, the unique dynamical force that allows the twister to become organized -- strong storms, hail and tornadoes are more likely, Ashley said. Outbreaks just happen to occur with a lot more of these ingredients coming together, he said. Not only do the fundamental ingredients exist at a higher rate, but they are also occurring across large areas, Ashley said. While severe weather has always existed, climate change appears to be the because of the greater magnitude of impacts when it comes to severe storms, Walker said. The geographic location with the most frequent tornado activity tends to change year over year, Houser told ABC News. One year the Southeast may get slammed with tornadoes, while another year the activity could be concentrated further west, she added. Overall, the research indicates that an environment supportive of the formation of tornadoes is expanding in the southeast, the experts said. A 2018 study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Northern Illinois University found that tornadoes are slightly declining in the Great Plains and increasing in the east. Recent simulations indicate that the area that produces the most significant tornadoes will be east of Interstate 35 -- including the mid-South, the Ozark plateau and the lower Ohio Valley, Ashley said. The areas west of I-35, Oklahoma, Kansas, the Dakotas, eastern Colorado and west Texas, will slightly decline, Ashley said, adding that those who live in the mid-South are at 25 greater risk of tornado threats. It is not so much that Tornado Alley will no longer apply to a large swath of the Central YOU.S., but that other regions are beginning to catch up to the tornado production rates that are more typical of the Central Plains, Houser said. If the frequency of tornadoes were measured purely by touchdown points, the Great Plains would easily clock in the most in the world, Ashley said. But tornadoes are typically measured by landscapes and how much damage they because. Another factor driving the because of increased impacts from tornadoes is the expanding bullseye effect, in which rural communities between the large cities in the south -- Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville -- have rapidly increased in population over the past 50 years, Ashley said. In past decades when a tornado formed in those areas, it may not have hit anything. The odds of something being hit by one of these events is going up substantially, Ashley said. It is projected to continue to increase, just because people continue to build out. It is just the natural occurrence of development in the United States. An unusual aspect of the recent tornado activity is how far north lines of twisters are forming -- especially in what is traditionally a cooler season, Houser said. It is not common to see tornadoes in places like Iowa, Illinois and New Jersey in this time of year, she added. American Meteorological Society expects that with the changing climate tornado season will escalate outside of the traditional peak season, which is March through May, according to a study published earlier this year. Meteorologists can predict favorable tornado conditions further out than ever before -- up to 10 days in some cases -- which is quite the mathematical feat, Ashley said. It is remarkable that we have been able to take what is a fluid atmosphere, which interfaces with a rotating planet, and take mathematical equations, and plug them into a model, Ashley said. But, they will probably never get to the point where they can predict with certainty when a tornado will form, namely because scientists do not really have all of the full complete picture of what makes a storm produce a tornado, Houser said. It is incredibly difficult to pinpoint when and where a specific ongoing storm is going to make a tornado -- even a couple of hours before, Houser said. A herculean effort would involve a plentitude of weather balloons and the ability to locate an atmospheric needle in a haystack -- a relatively small scale phenomena, she added. And because they are so small-scale, tornadoes are incredibly sensitive to small nuances in environmental conditions. You are dealing with something that is only, in many cases, tens of yards wide, at most, two and a half miles wide, Ashley said. That is tiny, compared to the entire global atmospheric system. In order to survive a tornado, the best thing to do is to be inside a sturdy structure, in the basement or an interior bathroom or closet, the experts said. The worst place to be is somewhere fully exposed, where flying debris can hit and kill you, or in a manufactured or mobile home. These houses are just not built to withstand even minimally strong tornadic winds, Ashley said. The leading because of death in a tornado is blunt force trauma, Houser said -- so appropriate attire, such as hard-soled shoes and bicycle helmets, is essential for survival in some cases. The truth is that if you prepare and do the right thing, your chances survivability is almost 100, Ashley said. Now if you do not do the right thing, you can certainly increase your odds of death and injury substantially, though.",https://abcnews.go.com/US/tornado-alley-shifting-due-climate-change-scientists-explain/story?id=98347077,0,"The mid-South is at a 25 greater risk of tornado threats, an expert says.

According to officials, crews are currently accessing interior spaces to extinguish hot spots and look for standing water. In the coming days, responders will ensure that the vessel is safe for investigators to board and for salvage work to proceed, including the removal of the reported 55,000 gallons of diesel onboard. The Coast Guard and NTSB will conduct an investigation into the because of the fire. The fire on the Kodiak Enterprise started early Saturday morning as the vessel was docked at Trident Seafoods in the Hylebos Waterway in Tacoma, Washington. The fire appears to have started in the forward portion of the 276-foot ship and later spread through entirety of the vessel, prompting fears of damage to the vessel's freon tanks. Although the smoke coming from the vessel has decreased, air monitoring has continued as a precaution. Particulate levels at the incident site and in nearby neighborhoods have not shown levels of concern. Dewatering operations are ongoing in order to improve stability as firefighters continue to apply water to the outside of the vessel to cool the hull. The vessel is currently surrounded by three layers of containment boom, and responders and equipment are staged and ready to respond if pollution is observed in the waterway. Vessels can request to transit the safety zone established on the Hylebos Waterway, and commercial traffic should contact Seattle Traffic on VHF-14.

Falling trees have killed two people in California as storms, damaging winds, rain and snowfall continue to batter the western US state. High-wind warnings and advisories were in effect from the Mexico border through Los Angeles and up into the San Francisco Bay area, where gusts of up to 97 kilometres per hour (60 mph) were forecast for some spots. Much of the region along with parts of Arizona and Nevada were under flood watches and advisories on Wednesday caused by the continued rain and snow melt, the US National Weather Service said. Our rivers, streams and creeks are flowing at near capacity. Any more rain that we get today is only going to cause more flooding or worsen the flooding that is ongoing, said Bill South, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Hanford, California. In Northern California's Bay Area community of Portola Valley, a man driving a sewer truck was killed when a tree fell onto his vehicle on Tuesday, the California Highway Patrol said. Fire officials in neighbouring Contra Costa County also said a large tree killed the passenger and injured the driver of a passing car. Mountain snow that forecasters said will be measured in feet fell on the central and southern parts of the state, as intense hail was reported in Sacramento, the state capital in the north. Trees and power lines were reported downed in the San Francisco Bay Area. More than 118,000 customers in California were without power by Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.US, a website that tracks utility outages. An Amtrak commuter train carrying 55 passengers struck a downed tree and derailed near the East Bay village of Porta Costa on Tuesday. The train remained upright and nobody was injured, Amtrak and fire officials said. Wind gusts reached 122 kmh (76 mph) - a level classified as hurricane force by the National Weather Service - in Santa Cruz mountain communities, including Boulder Creek. Resident Frank Kuhr waited for hours on Tuesday afternoon at a downtown supermarket for crews to remove large trees that were blocking a highway. Trees are down everywhere, Kuhr told The Associated Press news agency. The wind has been unbelievable. Branches were flying through the air, and folks could hear trees just falling and cracking. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said on Tuesday that it had 22 sites available across 12 counties to provide impacted Californians with shelters and other resources. The office said it was proactively coordinating the prepositioning of flood fighting personnel to be available if needed. The National Weather Service said the storm is a Pacific low pressure system interacting with California's 12th atmospheric river since late December. The latest storm follows months of intense weather in California that saw flooding ravage the state. California's persisting wet weather this winter, which included atmospheric rivers and February blizzards powered by arctic air, comes after years of droughts and wildfires.

All dates for March and April, and the services affected","Bid to end train strikes fails as union refuses to put 'best and final' 9pc pay rise offer to members Commuters are facing fresh travel chaos over Easter after rail workers voted to stage further strikes over next month and April amid an ongoing row over pay. Union leader Mick Lynch said workers will be taking sustained and targeted industrial action over the next few months, after blaming the Government for failing to allow train companies to make new, better offers. Mr Lynch, who heads up the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT), said: The Government can settle this dispute easily by unshackling the rail companies. However, its stubborn refusal to do so will now mean more strike action across the railway network and a very disruptive overtime ban. It comes days after the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT) rejected train operators' best and final 9pc pay rise. Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, had last week signalled he was not willing to allow train operators to sweeten their deal with better terms on pay. It dashed hopes that the RMT was nearing pay deals from both train operators and Network Rail. The Telegraph recently revealed that Mr Lynch had been facing pressure from members to avoid further strike action. What are the new train strike dates? The RMT announced this afternoon that rail workers at 14 train operators are due to stage four days of walkouts: Thursday March 16Saturday March 18 Monday March 20Saturday April 1 National Rail staff are also planning to strike on March 16. The RMT says it represents around 40,000 workers across National Rail and the 14 train operators, meaning major swathes of the train network will grind to a halt. Disruption is also expected to come from a planned overtime ban by National Rail workers who are members of the RMT. Which train companies will be affected? There are 14 train companies which will be affected by the staff walkouts, and it is expected that these will be the same ones which have been hit by earlier walkouts. These are: Chiltern Railways Cross Country Trains Greater Anglia, LNER, East Midlands Railway, c2c, Great Western Railway, Northern Trains, South Eastern South Western Railway Transpennine Express, Avanti West Coast, West Midlands Trains GTR (including Gatwick Express) Why are rail workers going on strike? Unions are demanding pay rises for their members who are battling soaring inflation, although train operators are limited in how much they can offer, given they require a mandate from the Government. Train bosses are also under pressure to cut costs to balance the books, after a slump in the number of people commuting into city centres every day. This means they are looking at introducing more technology. Union bosses have said they cannot accept so-called modernisation efforts, as it would result in a severe reduction in scheduled maintenance tasks, making the railways less safe, the closure of all ticket offices and thousands of jobs stripped out of the industry when the railways need more investment not less. Will I be able to get a refund if my train is going to be cancelled? In previous strikes, National Rail has said that, if a train journey is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled, passengers are entitled to a change or refund from wherever they bought their tickets. Customers with season tickets have also been able to claim compensation through the delay repay scheme, while National Rail has said that weekly season tickets which have not started yet can be refunded, although a 10 admin fee may apply.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/02/20/train-rail-strikes-2023-dates-march-april-rmt/,1,"Rail workers at 14 train operators are due to stage four days of walkouts.

Thirty-eight cars derailed on a train traveling from Madison, Illinois to Conway, Pennsylvania. Some of the cars that derailed were carrying vinyl chloride, a volatile carcinogen. Faced with the possibility of an uncontrolled explosion, shrapnel from exploding cars, and seepage of chemicals into the water, the governor, Mike DeWine, authorized a controlled burn. The resulting conflagration was visible many miles away. Both the liquid and the solid contaminated waste will stay in Ohio and be treated at various sites. Environmental officials said that air quality in East Palestine was normal. Yet, people continue to report respiratory problems and a general feeling of malaise. The EPA is continuing to provide updates concerning home re-entry screenings and air quality from 15 stations around the town. Many people live near rail lines, including here in St. Cloud. Many lines sweep through pretty countryside with rivers and fields. The damage done to the land around East Palestine is difficult. But even more tragic is the possibility that cancer rates will increase in the town in the future. Rivers in the area may be contaminated for years, with fish unable to live in the polluted water. There are many people now pointing fingers. The workers on many railways were recently stopped by law from striking. They point to longer hours and longer trains, less staff and less safety, as the rail companies try to squeeze more profits out of the system. The time required to inspect a rail car was halved recently to 90 seconds. While making efforts to compensate the town's citizens for having to temporarily vacate their homes, there has been criticism of the company's willingness to talk with them about their response. Not a single executive from Norfolk Southern showed up. Politicians have taken turns using the town as a platform for expressing their views and criticizing their opponents. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is promoting rail reform. Some of his proposals have found favor with rail union advocates. One such idea would be a new rule requiring at least 2 conductors on every train. This would make goods that travel by rail more expensive, of course, and squeeze rail company profits. Some of that would eventually pass back to farmers in higher costs of sending their goods to market. Governor Mike DeWine, meanwhile, has not requested federal help with the cleanup, insisting instead that Norfolk Southern tear up all the track at the crash site and decontaminate the land underneath. Even though the company is paying local residents, both he and nearby Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro are threatening lawsuits. The EPA is imposing other costs on the company. OSHA has taken over the investigation. Mechanical failure (a faulty bearing) is believed to have caused the explosion of several cars. Rather than seeing who can blame the company the most, I worry about the next possible accident. We were influenced the last couple of years by supply chain issues, which railways (along with ports and truckers) were asked to solve. As a result these companies, including Norfolk Southern, saw substantial increases in revenues and profits. Pressure to unsnarl supply chains may have caused the firm to cut corners and keep workers working longer hours and not necessarily firing poorly performing workers. Such pressures may have caused us to ignore railroad workers' concerns. It is clearly time to have them heard now and address the problems that have cropped up. After two years of such extraordinary pressure on transportation systems, can we be sure another accident will not happen?

But no imminent work action can happen because the federally controlled negotiating process still has a long way to go. The Air Line Pilots Association said voting for strike authorization will begin Tuesday. Getting rank-and-file permission to call a strike is a common union tactic that typically gives its bargainers more clout at the negotiating table. The pilots are frustrated by what they perceive as slow progress over two years. The FedEx (NYSE: FDX) pilots' contract became eligible for changes in November 2021, although talks began six months earlier. Management and the union have been bargaining through the auspices of the National Mediation Board for the past seven months after direct negotiations failed to produce an agreement. Officials say they have resolved retirement and quality-of-life issues but are still at odds over pay levels. At a time when our pilots should be joining our company in celebration of its 50th anniversary, we are instead forced to apply additional pressure to management in an effort to secure a new contract, said Capt. Chris Norman, chair of the FedEx Master Executive Council. We do not make a decision like this lightly, but we intend to send a strong and unified message to management that our pilots are willing to go the distance to achieve the contract we have earned. Under federal rules designed to prevent work interruptions in critical interstate commerce, workers are prohibited from striking and companies from locking out workers until a lengthy series of bargaining steps, including federal mediation, are completed. The federal mediator has the power to hold the parties in mediation indefinitely. The negotiation process can take more than a year at this stage. If no progress is made, the National Mediation Board (NMB) at some point may release the union to a 30-day cooling-off period during which negotiations can still take place but no strike or lockout can occur. If the NMB determines the parties have reached an impasse it can propose that the remaining issues be sent to a special panel for binding arbitration. Arbitration in the airline industry is rare because both sides must agree to it. The law allows the president to create an emergency board to investigate a labor dispute and issue a report within 30 days if the parties reject binding arbitration. That is followed by another 30-day period to consider the board's recommendations and reach an agreement. If no agreement is reached at the end of the cooling-off period, the parties may take action, such as a strike or lockout. FedEx remains focused on reaching a comprehensive agreement. With that in mind, we remain committed to bargaining in good faith with our pilots to achieve an agreement that is fair to them, our other team members, and all other FedEx stakeholders, the company said in a statement. ALPA's call for a vote of its members has no impact on our service as we continue delivering for our customers around the world. Several factors are influencing each party's bargaining position and relative power. Amid the COVID crisis and supply chain disruptions two years ago, e-commerce and air cargo were in extremely high demand and all-cargo operators enjoyed unrivaled profits. But e-commerce and international growth cooled off significantly last year. The softness in volume combined with an underutilized infrastructure network contributed to significant declines in operating income in the fiscal year first quarter and stirred management to implement a 6 billion cost-cutting and restructuring campaign. That includes parking aircraft, flying fewer flights and outsourcing more airlift to third parties. And there is always the prospect of federal intervention that could prevent the union from getting everything it seeks through collective bargaining. In December, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring all freight rail unions to ratify the labor agreement that union and railroad negotiators had reached in September. UPS pilots last year ratified a two-year contract extension.

(AP) -- A major industrial fire fueled by tons of scrap plastics in an Indiana city has been fully extinguished, although an evacuation order for people living nearby remains in place, the city's mayor said. Richmond Mayor Dave Snow tweeted Thursday night that the fire chief of the eastern Indiana city had informed him that the fire has been fully extinguished ahead of schedule. Officials had said earlier Thursday that the fire, which began Tuesday afternoon, was close to being extinguished at the 14-acre former factory site in Richmond, a city of 35,000 about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Indianapolis, near the Ohio border. People are also reading... An evacuation order for at least 1,500 people living within a half-mile was still in effect Friday morning, but Snow said in his tweet that we are now able to turn our attention to collecting air and water samples to determine when the evacuation order can be lifted. Fire Chief Tim Brown was not available Friday morning to provide an update, another fire official said. A message seeking an update was left Friday morning for Snow, whose assistant said he was in a meeting. Clouds of black smoke marred the spring sky after the fire began Tuesday. By Thursday afternoon, the smoke was lighter and less dense after progress in dousing the fires. Brown said Thursday that the site had six buildings full of plastics floor to ceiling and wall to wall but that he expected the fires to be out by late Thursday or Friday morning. Tests on debris that landed outside the fire zone showed some evidence of asbestos, according to the YOU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which urged residents not to disturb anything they found. On Thursday, Richmond officials disclosed more details about the city's dealings with a man who was operating the business where the fire occurred. They said that Seth Smith was barred from accepting more plastics for resale following a 2020 cleanup order, but that he was allowed to keep selling a vast collection still on hand. Smith told the city in 2019 that he sends scrap materials to 29 countries, according to meeting minutes of the Unsafe Building Commission. I own a bunch of trailers, Smith told the commission. I set the semis at these facilities and they fill them up with their scrap materials. When I started in 1987, there was only 4,000 plastic companies. Now there is over 47,000 plastic companies. It has got out of control, but now I have a plan. A judge in 2020 affirmed a cleanup order after city inspectors found fire sprinklers missing and fire hazards among stacks of bulk packages of plastics. Warehouse roofs had holes and there were no utilities. Although Richmond officials apparently were trying to work with Smith, Snow said the plastics dealer was at fault for the fire. Snow said Smith told the city to speak to his attorney about the fire. The Associated Press could not reach Smith through phone listings. Ron Moore, a lawyer who has represented him, declined to comment Thursday. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

According to the report, there had been no attack on the station, nor was fire opened. Denying the possibility of a terror attack, the report stated that the station was located in the safest place and there are two security check posts in front of the police station. It added that five personnel were also present for the security of the police station. There was no report of anyone entering the police station. It is yet to be decided whether the explosions were a result of a short circuit or the result of human oversight, the report shared. The report shared that the CTD police station in Swat had a warehouse in the Malakand region. This warehouse had 300 to 400 kilogrammes of explosives which exploded due to the explosions. It further stated that two suspected terrorists who had been brought in for investigation were also killed in the blast. The explosives had also been brought from Bajaur, Dir, Swat, and Buner and also included mortar shells, IEDs, and detonators. Earlier, it had been reported there were two explosions in the station. The report on Tuesday stated that the first explosion took place at 8:20am while the second explosion took place at 8:25am. It added that the first explosion was minor, while the second explosion detonated all the explosives. Talking to Geo News, CTD DG Khalid Sohail said that the incident took place in the old office of the CTD, and most offices and people had already been relocated to a new place before the explosions. He said that only a few officers were present in the building at the time of the incident, adding that the loss of civilian lives occurred due to the outward force of the explosion. Sohail said shock waves from the explosions caused the complete collapse of the building. Among those killed, three were civilians, five were prisoners, and nine were policemen. The hospital administration said that 10 out of the 51 people injured are in critical condition. Inquiry teams are still looking into what actually caused the explosions, he said.

The new cease-fire attempt came as alarm was growing that millions of Sudanese were on the brink of disaster from the past five days of warfare between the country's two most powerful generals. The fighting grew less intense in the first hours after the cease-fire took effect at 6 p.m., with sporadic clashes continuing in the city center, said Atiya Abdalla Atiya, secretary of the Doctors' Syndicate, who is still in the capital. But he said neither side has provided guarantees to his group to facilitate movement of health care workers and ambulances. Desperate residents of the capital have been running out of food and other supplies as they sheltered in their homes from the gun battles, bombardment and airstrikes on the streets outside. Hospitals have been damaged and forced to close or have been overwhelmed by wounded, with staff exhausted and medical supplies depleted. Increasingly, armed fighters have turned to looting shops and robbing anyone who dares step outside. Nearly 300 people have been killed in the past five days, the YOU.N. health agency said, but the toll is likely higher because many bodies lie uncollected in the streets. After the failure of Tuesday evening's truce attempt, hundreds gave up on trying to hold out for calm and fled their homes throughout the day Wednesday, even as explosions and gunfire shook Khartoum and the adjacent city of Omdurman. Residents of multiple neighborhoods told The Associated Press they could see men, women and children leaving with luggage, some on foot, others crowding into vehicles. On Wednesday evening, the army and its rivals, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, separately announced that a new 24-hour truce had begun. Prospects for the cease-fire were uncertain, however, as residents said they continued to hear sporadic shooting and explosions. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called for both sides to stand by a truce, renounce violence and return to negotiations. She said the army and the RSF are responsible for ensuring the protections of civilians and non combatants. Until now, army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo -- former allies against Sudan's pro-democracy movement -- seem determined to crush each other in their struggle for power. The explosion of violence between their forces, which began Saturday, has challenged international efforts to bring calm. Tuesday's cease-fire attempt failed even after YOU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to each general by phone and after pressure from their regional allies. Egypt, which backs the Sudanese military, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to the RSF, have been calling on all sides to stand down. Throughout the day Wednesday, the two sides battled around the main military headquarters in central Khartoum, which the RSF has tried repeatedly to capture, and the nearby airport. Residents said the military was pounding RSF positions with airstrikes. The army's monopoly on air power has appeared to give it an edge in fighting in Khartoum and Omdurman, enabling it to take several RSF bases over the past few days. But tens of thousands of fighters from the paramilitary force are fanned out across neighborhoods. Residents say armed men, mostly in RSF uniforms, have raided homes, offices and shops in neighborhoods across Khartoum. They roam in small groups from house to house, from shop to shop and loot everything, said a resident of the upscale neighborhood of Kafouri in northern Khartoum. They storm your house and take all valuable things at gunpoint. The resident said many families began to take up arms to defend their properties. He and his brother guard their home at night, he said. You do not have another option. Another resident, in the Arab Market, area said men in RSF uniforms broke into mobile phone shops in the market and looted anything they could carry. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Both sides in the conflict have a long history of human rights abuses. The RSF was born out of the Janjaweed militias, which were accused of widespread atrocities when the government deployed them to put down a rebellion in Sudan's western Darfur region in the early 2000s. Darfur has also seen heavy clashes in the past five days. The aid group Doctors Without Borders, or MSF after its French name, said armed men raided its compound in Nyala in Darfur, stealing vehicles and office equipment and looting a warehouse storing medical supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its office in Nyala was also looted, with one vehicle taken. Foreigners, including diplomats and aid workers, have also been trapped by the fighting, German media, including the DPA news agency, reported that three A400M transport planes were dispatched to evacuate German citizens from Khartoum, but turned around Wednesday due to security concerns in the city. Japan said it was preparing to send military aircraft to evacuate about 60 Japanese nationals. In Brussels, Dana Spinant, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, confirmed reports that a senior EU official had been shot and wounded in Sudan. Spinant did not provide details. The New York Times identified the official as Wim Fransen, a Belgian national. Separately, gunmen broke into the EU ambassador's residence and assaulted him this week, but a spokeswoman said he is back at work. Hospitals in Khartoum are running dangerously low on medical supplies, often operating without power and clean water, the ICRC said in a statement. Dozens of health care facilities in Khartoum and around the country have stopped functioning because they are close to clashes, the Sudanese Doctors' Syndicate said Wednesday. At least nine hospitals were bombed, it said. Our urgent priority is to get medical assistance to hospitals and try to make repairs to their water and power lines so they can treat the wounded, said Patrick Youssef, the ICRC's Africa regional director. But fighting has made it impossible to reach the facilities. The YOU.N.'s World Health Organization said Wednesday at least 296 people have been killed and more than 3,000 wounded since fighting began, without offering a breakdown of civilians and combatants killed. The Doctors' Syndicate, which monitors casualties, said Tuesday that at least 174 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded. The conflict between the military and the RSF has once again derailed Sudan's transition to democratic rule after decades of dictatorship and civil war. A popular uprising four years ago helped depose long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir. But Burhan and Dagalo jointly carried out a 2021 coup. Both generals have a long history of human rights abuses, and their forces have cracked down on pro-democracy activists. Under international pressure, Burhan and Dagalo recently agreed to a framework agreement with political parties and pro-democracy groups. But the signing was repeatedly delayed as tensions rose over the integration of the RSF into the armed forces and the future chain of command.  Magdy reported from Cairo.

No fatalities were immediately reported, but at least three people were injured in the storm, officials said. It was awful ... a lot of homes were destroyed, LaGrange Mayor-elect Willie T. Edmondson told CNN affiliate WSB. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency Sunday. A storm that swept through Troup County, Georgia, left severe damage in the city of LaGrange. WANF I have issued a State of Emergency order following the severe storms and tornadoes that struck this morning, Kemp tweeted. As we continue to monitor the weather and work with local partners to address damage throughout the day, I ask all Georgians to join us in praying for those impacted. Across the region, more than 20 million Southerners are at risk of severe storms Sunday. A tornado watch has been issued across parts of Alabama, including Montgomery and Troy, and parts of Georgia, including Columbus, La Grange and Macon, until 1 p.m. Threats include the possibility of strong tornadoes, hail the size of tennis balls and damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. The storms will then push east into the Carolinas by Sunday afternoon, posing a threat of damaging winds. A marginal risk for severe storms also includes parts of central Illinois and Indiana. And a batch of fresh storms - capable of producing very large hail, tornadoes and fierce winds - is expected to form across parts of eastern Texas on Sunday afternoon before pushing into Louisiana, Mississippi, and eventually Alabama through the afternoon and evening. 26 killed in a wave of severe storms President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration Sunday for parts Mississippi on after tornado-spawning storms shredded homes and killed 26 people across the South.

Tornado decimates Mississippi town, and now the 'city is gone' An EF-4 tornado flattened much of the community of Rolling Fork, which endured maximum wind gusts of 170 miles per hour, weather service Meteorologist Bill Parker said. EF-4 and EF-5 tornadoes are considered 'violent' and extremely rare, and make up only about 1 of all tornadoes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The last EF-4 tornado to hit Mississippi was on April 19, 2020. An aerial view of the town of Rolling Fork on Saturday. Cheney OrrReuters The storms nearly leveled some neighborhoods and knocked power out for thousands, officials said. As the tornado tore through Rolling Fork, one thought raced through resident Shanta Howard's mind: Lord, I do not want to die, she told CNN affiliate WAPT. Drone footage showed homes leveled and reduced to piles of wood, vehicles tossed around and trees splintered. Rolling Fork Mayor Eldridge Walker, who leads the town of about 2,000 people, said the city is gone. US Rep. Bennie Thompson came to a similar conclusion. The police department is destroyed. City Hall is destroyed, Thompson said. The county courthouse is damaged. The fire department is devastated. There is no grocery store that is operable in the community. Resident Noel Crook surveys the damage Saturday in Silver City, Mississippi. Hannah MattixThe Clarion-LedgerAP As search-and-rescue efforts continued, the community's only hospital was offline Saturday. Those injured were taken to the nearest hospital over 50 miles away, Thompson said. We have been finding several casualties, said Sharkey County Supervisor Jessie Mason. It is just an ongoing process and it is going to be a long road ahead. Rolling Fork Vice Mayor LaDonna Sias said residents hid from the destructive tornado, taking cover in closets, in tubs and under pillows as the storm roared outside. It seemed like forever until that noise stopped, Sias recalled, describing stepping out to see homes destroyed and hearing people screaming. Sias' own home was destroyed in the tornado. It was just totally devastating, she said. Even though we lost everything, this stuff can be replaced. Material things can be replaced, but to lose a loved one - it was just heart wrenching, Sias said.

A contractor who worked at the Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill died of blastomycosis recently, the Public Health Delta  Menominee Counties said Friday. The health department began investigating an outbreak at the mill last month after sick employees, ailing from pneumonia-like symptoms, tested positive for a fungal infection called blastomycosis. Brian Peterson, the mill's vice president of operations, said in a statement that they were deeply saddened by the death. The contractor has not been identified by the company or health officials. Anyone who works at our facility is part of our team, and we are keeping this individual, their family, coworkers and friends in our thoughts and close to our hearts, Peterson said. Billerud said last week it would be temporarily suspending operations at the mill for up to three weeks for the safety of its employees and contractors. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus that primarily lives in moist soil and decomposing organic matter, such as wood, and it spreads through the inhalation of spores, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can include fever and cough, and people with more weakened immune systems may have more severe cases. The infection can spread to the lungs and other organs, the CDC says. A total of 21 cases have been confirmed by the public health department since March, and more than 70 probable cases have been reported. Of those cases, 12 people have been hospitalized in the outbreak, according to Public Health Delta  Menominee Counties. Billerud, a multinational paper and packaging company based in Sweden, said in a statement to NBC News last week that it has implemented several recommendations from public health experts since the outbreak was identified. Its Michigan mill was founded in 1911 as the Escanaba Pulp and Paper Co. on the bank of the Escanaba River in the state's Upper Peninsula. The river connects to Little Bay de Noc off Lake Michigan. Blastomyces, the fungus responsible for the infection, is typically found in the areas surrounding the Great Lakes, as well as the Ohio, Mississippi and Saint Lawrence rivers, according to the CDC. More than 800 people are employed at the mill, which can produce about 730,000 tons of paper annually, according to Billerud's website.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/1-person-died-fungal-outbreak-michigan-paper-mill-infected-nearly-100-rcna80053,0,"A contractor who worked at the Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill died of blastomycosis.

It is a horrifyingly normal disaster.","An explosion and fire at a dairy farm on Monday in the Texas panhandle has been called the deadliest cattle barn fire ever recorded: it left one worker in critical condition and killed 18,000 cows. The because of the fire, which occurred at South Fork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, 75 miles northwest of Lubbock, is still under investigation by the state fire marshal. In an interview with a local news station, Castro County Sheriff Sal Rivera said it may have been caused by the facility's manure management equipment. It is possible that it overheated and the methane and things like that might have ignited and spread out with an explosion and a fire, he said. Fires on large-scale animal farms, or factory farms, are surprisingly common. Over the last decade, at least 6.5 million farmed animals, mostly chickens, perished in barn fires in the US, according to Washington, DC-based nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute (AWI). The fires are part of a broader pattern of mass casualty events on factory farms, where 99 percent of America's meat, dairy, and eggs are produced. Some are the result of human or mechanical error, but many stem from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, blizzards, and extreme temperatures, like last summer's scorching heat wave in Kansas that killed thousands of cows who were subsequently dumped in a landfill. Disease outbreaks, too, result in mass death or culling on farms. The Dimmitt fire, however, was unusual in its scale. Because the farm was enormous -- with reportedly 19,000 cattle, it was among the biggest dairy farms in the country -- it killed an order of magnitude more cows than are typically killed in fires, enough to fill 26 football fields, according to a USA Today analysis. For context, the largest number of cows killed in a single fire between 2018 and 2021 in the US was 548. What is so striking about this incident in Texas is just the sheer number of animals that were on the operation in one building to begin with, said Allie Granger, a policy associate with AWI. Frank Brand, who operates the South Fork farm, said he could not provide comment when he was reached by phone Thursday. High death tolls could be more likely in the future as mega-factory farms proliferate, packing ever more animals into cramped warehouse-sized sheds. From 1992 to 2017, the number of US farms with 1,000 or more dairy cows has more than tripled, even as the total number of dairy cows has remained about the same. Fires at livestock and poultry production and storage properties are quite common and have been for years, the National Fire Protection Association reported earlier this year. Animal farms do not have the same fire codes and safety requirements as buildings designed for humans. Farms often lack fire alarms and sprinklers, and they are filled with flammable materials like hay. Barn fires are typically caused by malfunctioning heating or electrical systems, according to the NFPA, and are more common in colder states in the Midwest and Northeast. Fires at large, industrial-scale facilities are particularly concerning because they can wipe out so many animals at once. Chicken factory farms can house hundreds of thousands or even millions of animals each year, so a single fire at one of these facilities can account for the majority of barn fire deaths in a year. Chickens account for about 92 percent of the 6.5 million animals killed in barn fires, with pigs comprising about 2 percent and cows less than 1 percent. The true number is likely significantly higher, AWI notes, because not all states have the same reporting requirements, and because farm animals are property with essentially no legal protection from suffering. Media reports of these incidents often focus on financial losses to farm owners, rather than the immense suffering of farmed animals who burn to death. Fires are not totally avoidable, but more state agencies could help mitigate the risk by adopting the National Fire Protection Association's Fire and Life Safety in Animal Housing Facilities Code, which requires fire protection measures on farms. The latest edition, published in 2022, requires annual fire hazard inspections, contacting emergency services when alarms go off, fire drills, employee training, and minimum spacing between buildings. Only a few states have adopted the code for farms. Meat, dairy, and egg producers themselves could implement relatively straightforward reforms to prevent fires, according to Granger: conduct proactive fire safety inspections alongside fire officials and experts, ensure equipment is routinely checked and maintained, and institute worker training and emergency planning. Unfortunately, the industry has not taken upon themselves to adopt the code and their own standards and guidelines that they use as a part of their certification programs or auditing programs, Granger said. The reporting system for barn fires could also be improved in order to better understand its scope -- fire officials often fail to include the number of animals who have died in their incident reports. The more fundamental problem, though, is factory farms' size, which can make for disturbingly high death counts from fires and other disasters, and can make them harder to prevent and contain. That was evident, for example, in last year's bird flu outbreak, in which the poultry industry resorted to exterminating tens of millions of farmed birds through a ghastly method called ventilation shutdown plus, essentially killing them via heatstroke. In a letter last May, Gwendolen Reyes-Illg, a veterinary adviser to AWI, urged the nation's largest veterinary association to advocate for restrictions on factory farm size, arguing that the spread of mega-factory farms was contributing to the use of that cruel method because meat producers found it impractical to deploy other cull methods in such large facilities. For many types of natural disasters and disease outbreaks -- although not for barn fires unless they began as a wildfire -- meat producers receive taxpayer-funded reimbursements to recoup their losses, and there is been recent movement in Congress to hold the livestock industry accountable for such disasters. Late last year, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced a bill that, among other provisions, requires large meat and egg producers to prepare for disasters and pay the costs of dealing with them, including cleanup and disposal of animal carcasses. The idea is that forcing the industry to internalize some of its risk would prevent producers from inflicting harm for free. The bill stands little chance of moving through this Congress, but it is a sign, among others, that the public health and environmental problems wrought by factory farming are becoming increasingly difficult for Washington to ignore. For America's big agricultural states, including Texas -- where everything's bigger -- the Dimmitt tragedy should be a wakeup call about the risks of a food system increasingly dependent on super-sized factory farms.",https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23683141/texas-farm-fire-explosion-dimmitt-cows-factory-dairy,1,"18,000 cows were killed in a fire at a Texas dairy farm on Monday. The cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state fire marshal. Over the last decade, at least 6.5 million farmed animals, mostly chickens, perished in barn fires in the US. 99 percent of America's meat, dairy, and eggs are produced on factory farms, where fires are surprisingly common. The fire killed an order of magnitude more cows than are typically killed in fires, enough to fill 26 football fields."

While port executives have sought to downplay the potential of a significant job action, fears of disruptions have already been weighing on people while recent events are only serving to increase the concerns. ILWU Local 13, the union's largest local on the West Coast, has continued to disrupt operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's largest port complex, writes the Pacific Maritime Association in a statement released on April 13. While the union is using new tactics, the result is the same: the disruption of terminal operations. The PMA which represents employers at the 70 terminals located in the West Coast ports is detailing a series of complaints, writing Together, these illegal work actions have disrupted activities at some of the largest and most active terminals in the United States, which play a critical role in the movement of cargo to and from markets throughout the nation. Among the tactics they are citing as being used by the Local are unilaterally delayed the standard dispatch process, which is jointly administered by PMA and ILWU. They are accusing the ILWU of refusing to let the PMA participate in the labor dispatch process, resulting in slowing the start of work on each shift. They also say the union has forced crucial cargo handling equipment to be taken out of operation at several key terminals. These latest issues follow last week when members of Local 13 did not show up for their assigned shifts on Thursday, April 6, in the afternoon and again for morning shifts on April 7. Terminals across both ports were forced to suspend operations for approximately 24 hours due to a shortage of workers. The PMA also repeats its position that the Local stopped complying with a contract provision, about a month ago that permits staggered shifts during breaks for meal periods. The goal is to permit cargo to continue to be received and delivered without interruption during the break periods. For its part, the ILWU Local 13 said last week's labor shortage was due to a monthly union meeting on Thursday evening, which this month involved the swearing in of a newly elected president of the local. Friday, they noted, was a religious holiday where some workers wanted to be with their families. Longshore workers at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach (Ports) are still hard at work and remain committed to moving the nation's cargo, said the ILWU Local 13. Asked to comment on the labor issues during his monthly update, Gene Seroka, Executive Director of the Port of Los Angeles, on Wednesday, April 12, sought to downplay last week's disruptions saying it was a slow period due to the holiday. He told reporters, I do not see a widespread labor disruption at any time in the future. Seroka however said last week's actions were a call to action, reiterating his position for months that a settlement needs to be reached as quickly as possible. He said after last week all eyes are on the contract negotiations and the time has come to get a settlement to remove uncertainties and the fear of wider disruptions to supply chains and the nation's economy. While saying he expected soft volumes in the second quarter, Seroka said he sees signs beginning to appear and forecasts a moderate increase by the third quarter. The National Retail Federation has also said they expect volumes to continue monthly increases, but they also warned of the dangers to the recovery from labor actions at the West Coast ports. The retail trade association expressed its concerns before last week's job actions and today's statement from the PMA.",https://maritime-executive.com/article/pma-accuses-ilwu-local-of-illegal-disruptive-actions-at-socal-ports,1,"International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Local 13 continues to disrupt operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, writes the Pacific Maritime Association.

When she highlighted the same, it was in vain. She was later sacked by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) as well but her fight for flight safety continues. Mangala Narasimhan (54) was an air traffic controller (ATC) and Aviation Safety Officer posted at Mumbai airport when she noticed several air safety violations. Since the lives of thousands of passengers were at stake, she took up these issues with her higher ups, but in vain. Among other things, gross violation of height restriction rules by buildings coming in the way of the take-off and landing funnels of the airport was particularly worrying her. When a PIL was filed by a lawyer at Bombay High Court, she was made a respondent, in which capacity she placed all the facts before the judges. She was rewarded by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) by being sacked. In an interview, Mangala spoke to S Balakrishnan on her fight for flight safety. Excerpts: What prompted you to start the fight for flight safety? A childhood incident was responsible for it. I was only 17 years old studying in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu. My elder brother, an NDA graduate whom I hero worshipped, was an air force navigator on AN32 transport aircraft. Once when I returned home from school, I found him crying like a child on our mother's lap. He was sad that some of his colleagues were killed in an accident at Ludhiana. It was a nine aircraft formation and he was in aircraft number 3. Aircraft number 6 and 7 collided during the final approach of landing. The year was 1983-1984. That scene at my home left a deep impression on me. I realised how important flight safety was. I subsequently cleared the exams to become an ATC; a job that I regarded as a mission aimed at flight safety. Many of the air accidents could have been avoided if necessary precautions had been taken. My repeated warnings from 2012 onwards about latent dangerous conditions at Mumbai airport's main Runway 0927 and Calicut airport were ignored by the authorities. The same latent dangerous conditions at Calicut airport's runway resulted in an accident on August 7, 2020, in which 19 innocent passengers and the two pilots were killed. The accident was blamed on pilot error. The pilots are dead and cannot defend themselves. But the fact is that the authorities ignored my warnings and that was the reason for the loss of lives. Mumbai airport's main runway 09  27 is still unsafe. You have been accused of violating the organisational chain of command in AAI. Please comment. Air safety does not need any celebratory protocol. If your immediate superior does not respond to your warnings, then you are at liberty to approach the higher ups. The safety of lakhs of passengers is at stake. It should not be compromised on bureaucratic red tape. I only functioned like a conscientious ATC official. What specific air safety issues did you take up? With respect to Mumbai, air safety violations are in four categories: unsafe runway conditions, violations of rules framed by international civil aviation safety organisation, AAI and the DGCA, tall buildings within a 20-km radius of the airport and non-reporting of air safety incidents to me by Mumbai ATC. More than 85 of accidents take place during take off or landing when the reaction time for the pilot is very less. How many buildings are violating air safety norms in Mumbai? An AAI  MIAL Obstacle survey in 2010-11 revealed 439 obstacles on the take-off and landing paths alone. In between buildings were not considered. Apparently, the 2020 survey revealed 1,140 obstacles in the narrow take off and landing funnels. In 2014 a PIL was filed by a lawyer in Bombay High Court on this issue and in 2018 I was permitted to file a fresh petition. The matter is still pending. Is it true that you were sacked by the AAI? The HC judgment permitting me to file a petition was passed on April 6, 2018, and 10 days after that I was dismissed by the AAI. I have challenged my illegal dismissal. I am certain I will win because my fight is for air safety. When a passenger dies in a crash, his entire family suffers. Powerful builders tried to win me over and even told me that my objections would be overruled by the powers that be. I am certain that the HC will give weightage to the safety of passengers and not to the interests of builders and those who protect them.",https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/mumbai-airports-main-runway-is-still-unsafe-says-mangala-narasimhan-former-aviation-safety-officer,0,"Mangala Narasimhan (54) was an air traffic controller (ATC) and Aviation Safety Officer posted at Mumbai airport.

After the government rested its case, Michel's lead lawyer, David Kenner, delivered a 25-minute statement that leaned heavily into his client's upbringing and commercial success -- a stark contrast to the government's approach in late March when federal prosecutors gave their opening statement. While prosecutors last month alluded to Michel's successful album in the 90s, they generally avoided discussing his celebrity status. Kenner took the opposite approach Monday, reminding jurors that Michel had grown up in poverty before founding the Fugees with Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean and achieving wealth and fame by age 25. Kenner then moved on to describing the first couple of chance meetings between Michel and his absent co-defendant Jho Low, a Malaysian billionaire who is suspected of stealing billions form a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB. Low has not been arrested and remains an international fugitive. Michel saw Low spend ridiculous amounts of money on celebrity friends, real estate, entertainment companies and other ventures, Kenner said. Michel has been charged with felonies alleging his participation in a conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions using foreign money, witness tampering and failure to register as a foreign agent of the Chinese government. The most serious of the charges carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Michel has pleaded not guilty to all charges. During their opening statement, prosecutors portrayed Michel as cash-strapped and willing to do the bidding of a foreign government in exchange for a payday. Kenner did not deny that Michel was paid for work he did with Low, but told jurors Monday there was nothing illegal about the payments. The evidence will show that making money, even if you consider it greedy, is not a crime, he said. Kenner also told jurors that Michel, Low and others involved in their alleged scheme to lobby the Trump administration never agreed to violate the Foreign Agent Registration Act by concealing their efforts. Such a conspiracy never, ever existed, Kenner said. Kenner also stressed to jurors that FARA is a law that is violated when individuals fail to disclose political work on behalf of foreign interest. This is not a James Bond spying kind of statute, he said. It is not cloak and dagger kind of stuff. No one in Michel's orbit told him that he needed to register as a foreign agent, Kenner said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/lawyers-former-fugees-member-pras-michel-present-defense-conspiracy-tr-rcna80139,0,"Defense lawyers for Pras Michel begin presenting their case in federal court.

CNN,"CNN -- The footage quickly spread on social media, as these things often do. Tiger Woods gingerly walking towards his caddie after an approach shot, seven cautious steps in the miserable Augusta rain which told us more about the limitations Woods says he faces than words ever could. He did not grimace - a single-minded champion like Woods would not - but plenty watching the clip would have as they saw him struggling to walk. He was just about managing to play the game he had once dominated. At this point, Woods was nine-over at The Masters, dropping shots at nearly every hole in the third round to leave him bottom of the leaderboard. He had previously squeezed through the cut with a three-over overall score at the halfway mark. This clearly was not the Woods of old, but it is been quite some time since we saw that powerful, athletic, all-conquering version of the 15-time major winner. Many would have quit there and then. For Woods, who famously won the 2008 US Open with a fractured leg, that came the next day as organizers announced he had withdrawn before the resumption of the rain-hit third round. Woods explained minutes later on Twitter that a foot injury (plantar fasciitis - a tissue inflammation that causes pain in the heel) was the because of the discomfort we had seen. His body weakened by multiple surgeries and injuries, the elements were against him. The cold and rain do not suit a man who needs an extensive warm-up routine to get his body to acquiesce to the demands of tournament golf. Or, perhaps, the weather saved him from himself. I hate to say this but yesterday (Saturday) at the end of this show I was just hoping that he would not make the cut, that he would just finish one outside, Sky Sports analyst Butch Harmon said. Not because I do not want to see Tiger Woods play, we always want to see Tiger Woods play, but you could just see he was in agony trying to get around there and it was not a surprise at all to be honest that he had to withdraw. The schedule, too, became unkind for the former world No.1, and the undulating course was already a challenge for his right leg, held together by rods, screws, plates and pins after a serious car crash in 2021.

Mark BakerAP Masters 2023: The best pictures from Augusta Prev Next An early wake-up on Saturday to finish a second round, which had been suspended Friday because of the weather, before taking to the tee again later in the day to start the third round, was a physical test. For Woods to play more than 18 holes in a day - which would have been the requirement on Sunday as organizers tried to complete a rain-hit tournament in the scheduled four days - seemed, at best, optimistic, even without injury. He has played just one competitive tournament this season and told reporters in the build-up to The Masters that he does not play or practice much anymore. In the end, he managed 14 holes on Saturday (seven in the second round; seven in the third) and his body could do no more. Had Woods completed four rounds at Augusta, questions would still be asked about his future. He had suggested last week that this could be his final Masters appearance and admitted that he was in constant pain during the opening round on Thursday. But now we wonder not only if Woods will ever again attempt to negotiate Augusta's hilly terrain, but also whether he will tee off at another major. We know all about Woods' past: the 15 major titles, the 82 PGA Tour wins, the millions earned, the skill, the determination, the affairs he admitted to before the world's media, the multiple back injuries, the surgeries, the redemptive 2019 Masters win, and the career-threatening car crash. Woods has gone from top of the world to rock bottom and back again. But aged 47, the future is uncertain. He is no longer the best golfer around. He is no longer one of the best. The truth is, it is unclear how good he now is or how good he still could be. Tiger Woods walks to the green on the 13th hole during the third round of the Masters. Matt SlocumAP Woods spoke of completing four rounds at Augusta National last year as a small victory, but also told reporters last week: I just have to be cognizant of how much I can push it. It is been a tough, tough road. I do not know how many more (Masters) I have in me. Will he continue to put his body through tournament golf just to be an also-ran? Can the greats ever become accustomed to being average? Not that Woods will ever just be a regular player, as the headlines his Masters withdrawal generated testify. Arguably, he is still the biggest draw in the game. Harmon told Sky Sports that he thought Woods would play another major. If you look where The Open is this year Royal Liverpool it is fairly flat ... US Open in LA - yes, the LA Country Club's got some hills and stuff. The difficulty here Augusta National is the walk, it is just such a tough walk for everybody and so I think it had to happen for his sake. Will we see him again? Gosh I hope so ... Can he ever win another one? I would never say Tiger Woods cannot do something because every time we think that, he proves us wrong - he did a few years ago right here at Augusta.",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/10/golf/tiger-woods-future-spt-intl/index.html,0,"Tiger Woods withdraws from The Masters with a foot injury. Woods was nine-over at the halfway point of the third round. Woods had previously squeezed through the cut with a three-over overall score. Woods won the 2008 US Open with a fractured leg, that came the next day as organizers announced he had withdrawn before the resumption of the rain-hit third round in Augusta, Georgia. The 15-time major winner said he was suffering from plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the heel."

Ancient Babylonian treasures, painstakingly unearthed, are slowly disappearing again under wind-blown sand in a land parched by rising heat and prolonged droughts. Iraq is among the countries worst-hit by climate change. It endured a dozen major sandstorms last year. When the storms clear, layers of fine sand cover everything, including the Sumerian ruins of Umm al-Aqarib, the Mother of Scorpions, in the southern desert province of Dhi Qar. Sandstorms have slowly begun to reverse years of work there to unearth the temples' terracotta facades and many priceless artifacts, said archaeologist Aqeel al-Mansrawi. Archaeologists in Iraq have always had to shovel sand, but now the volumes are growing. After a decade of worsening storms, sand at Umm al-Aqarib now covers a good part of the site, that dates back to around 2350 BECAUSE and spans more than five square kilometers, he said. In the past, the biggest threat was looting of antiquities at the ruins, where pottery fragments and clay tablets bearing ancient cuneiform script have been discovered. Now the changing weather and its impact on the land, especially creeping desertification, spell an additional threat to ancient sites all across southern Iraq, said Mansrawi. In the next 10 years, he said, it is estimated that sand could have covered 80 to 90 percent of the archaeological sites. Last year, a study published in the journal Antiquites found that climate change is affecting archaeological sites and landscapes around the world. As well as desertification, extreme weather events such as increased rainfall, coastal erosion and rising sea levels have threatened archeological treasures globally.

The safety advisory from the Federal Railroad Administration stopped short of telling the railroads exactly what to do. Instead, it encouraged them to make sure the detectors are getting inspected often enough by trained employees and that the railroads have safe standards for determining when to stop a train or park a railcar when a warning is triggered. The National Transportation Safety Board has said the crew operating the Norfolk Southern train that derailed outside East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border on February 3 got a warning from such a detector but could not stop the train before more than three dozen cars came off the tracks and caught fire. The Federal Railroad Administration said overheating bearings likely caused at least four other derailments since 2021. The Ohio derailment forced half the town of about 5,000 people to evacuate for days as toxic chemicals burned, leaving residents with lingering health concerns. Government tests have not found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area. The EPA opened an office in the town Tuesday to help address residents' questions. For trains containing hazardous materials, the potential consequence of a derailment is catastrophic, and allowing a train transporting a hazardous material to continue to operate, without restriction, after an HBD (hot bearing detector) alert is likely not appropriate, the FRA advisory said. Norfolk Southern officials did not immediately respond to the advisory. After the NTSB issued its preliminary findings last week, the railroad said the derailment had prompted it to inspect all of the nearly 1,000 trackside heat detectors on its network. That was on top of regular inspections it normally does on those sensors every 30 days, Norfolk Southern said. Dave Clarke, the former director of the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee, said the safety advisory was not surprising. This is just FRA proposing the obvious, in my opinion. I doubt if any Class I (major freight railroad) was waiting for this, he said. But railroad labor groups welcomed the move. Unions say the major freight railroads have become riskier because workers are spread so thin after deep job cuts over the past six years, inspections are being rushed, and preventative maintenance may be neglected. There are no federal regulations guiding wayside detectors, including their placement along tracks or temperature thresholds. There is not even a federal definition of wayside detection technologies, said Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all rail unions. Rail workers are eager to see a complete set of federal regulations on the installation, operation, testing, repairs, and maintenance of all wayside detection technologies, including defect detectors. In the Ohio derailment, the bearing that failed got hotter as it passed three detectors before the crash but did not get hot enough to set off a warning until the last detector, according to the NTSB. The FRA said railroads should consider developing ways to analyze temperature trends those sensors spot to help identify potential problems sooner. The Association of American Railroads trade group said the industry has a strong track record of pushing for safety improvements and tough tank car standards to prevent hazardous materials spills. The group said the widespread use of these detectors is an example of the industry's commitment to safety. Professor Allan Zarembski, who leads the University of Delaware's rail engineering and safety program, noted that overheating bearings because only a handful of the more than 1,000 derailments each year, indicating that the existing system already finds nearly all such problems. There is great political pressure to do something now -- knee-jerk reaction, 'Do something now. We have got to do something now.' But I am not convinced the knee-jerk reaction is going to do a lot of good, Zarembski said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg proposed a number of safety improvements last week, but the industry has been pushing to delay any major changes until after the NTSB completes its investigation a year or more from now.",https://globalnews.ca/news/9518668/ohio-train-derailment-federal-regulators-railroads-examine-track-detectors/,1,"The Federal Railroad Administration says overheating bearings likely caused at least four other derailments since 2021.

Hundreds of thousands of workers in various industries went on strike in what could be the biggest walkout since the current wave of industrial action started last year. Members of several trade unions have taken action, mounting hundreds of picket lines amid ongoing anger over issues including pay, jobs, pensions and conditions. The Tube strike by drivers in the Aslef and Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) unions has resulted in no service on any Tube line, according to Transport for London. The Docklands Light Railway and Elizabeth line were also part-suspended because of the strike - as huge crowds were pictured cramped in tunnels at Tottenham Court Road station - with the mass shutdown resulting in an increase in road congestion. Separately this morning, there were also delays between Watford and London Euston due to an trespasser; Watford and Clapham Junction due to a points failure; Charing Cross and London Bridge due to overrunning engineering works; Bromley North and Grove Park due to a delayed driver; Twickenham due to a signalling fault; Margate and Herne Bay due to a broken down train; and Reading due to a signalling fault. TomTom said at 8am the average time it took to drive 10km (6.2 miles) in London was three minutes longer than normal at that time, at 21 minutes and 17 seconds. There were huge queues at Tottenham Court Road this morning, where the Elizabeth Line is still running Large queues form for buses outside London Victoria railway station today as the strike begins People queue for a bus outside Stratford railway station in East London early this morning London Underground trains sit unused at Northfields depot in West London this morning A passenger walks past closed gates at Stratford station in East London this morning The geolocation technology company added that there were 1,419 traffic jams in the capital stretching for a total of 1,065km (662 miles). Who is taking part in the Budget Day strikes These are the sectors affected by the Budget Day walkouts today: Civil service Around 130,000 members of the Public and Commercial Services union and thousands of civil servants in Prospect are involved in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. More than 130 Government departments, agencies and sites - including the British Museum and British Library, as well as the Border Force - will be affected. Education Members of the National Education Union in England will strike as part of a long-running dispute over pay. The strike will continue on Thursday, causing huge disruption to schools. Universities More than 70,000 staff members of the University and College Union (UCU) will begin the first of three successive days of strike action across 150 universities in the UK. The UCU is currently in negotiations with the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents 144 employers, via the conciliation service Acas. UCU members are set to strike for another three days from Monday next week. London Underground Drivers in Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport union will strike in a dispute over pensions and conditions. Tube services will be crippled all day, with a knock-on effect likely on Thursday morning. Health Junior doctors in the British Medical Association will strike for the third successive day in a row over pay. BBC Members of the National Union of Journalists at BBC Local in England will strike in protest at programme cuts. Advertisement Those striking today include teachers, university lecturers, civil servants, junior doctors, London Underground drivers and BBC journalists. Despite talks being held between unions and the Westminster Government, the public sector strikes remain deadlocked. Some of the strikes, such as those by teachers, will only be held in England as progress has been made in Wales and Scotland. This morning, an Aslef organiser denied that London Underground workers were striking to earn more pay. Finn Brennan, its district organiser for the London underground, told LBC: 'This is actually the first time Aslef have taken action across the underground since 2015. It comes after our members voted by 99 per cent in favour of the strike. 'It is not a strike about pay, it is not a strike looking for more time off. 'We simply want TfL to commit to negotiate with us about changes instead of trying to impose changes. 'There is a huge hole in TfL's budget as a result of the pandemic and they want to fill that by cutting staff numbers, cutting working conditions and crucially cutting staff pensions. 'We have always said we are prepared to negotiate change but quite understandably and quite rightly our members are not prepared to pay the price for the hole that has been left in TfL's budget by the Government's failure to properly fund public transport in London.' Mr Brennan added that further strike action on the Underground was 'very likely', saying: 'Yes, I am afraid so. 'I do think it is going to be very likely unless there is a change of course from the Government who are pulling the strings at TfL and unless London underground is properly funded so we can deliver a decent service for the people of London.' Mr Brennan earlier praised all unions striking today for timing their strikes to be simultaneous. He said: 'It is rock solid action. 'It does fit in with action that is happening - as you spoke to teachers... all of these strikes come from the same root because: the failure by the Government to fund the vital public services that people need.' Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka warned the action is just the start of strikes that could last until the end of the year. He said: 'On Budget Day we are asking Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to give our hard-working members a fair pay rise. We have been given a 2 per cent pay rise when food inflation was 16 per cent last week. '40,000 civil servants use food banks and 45,000 claim in-work benefits because they are so poor. The Government can stop these strikes today by putting money on the table for our members. Closed gates at London Paddington Underground station this morning due to the Tube strike Strike signage at London Paddington station this morning as the industrial action begins Closed gates at London Paddington Underground station this morning due to the Tube strike 'If they do not, our action will escalate. Where the Westminster Government has a direct involvement in disputes, very little progress has been made. All Tube lines have been severely affected by the strikes, with most suspended throughout the day 'Shamefully, ministers do not seem interested in giving their own employees a fair pay rise to help them through the cost-of-living crisis and beyond.' It comes after it was revealed that Britain has lost more than 1.5million working days to a string of industrial disputes. The Office for National Statistics said 220,000 days were lost to strikes in January, added to 822,000 in December and 462,000 in November. And the huge scale of disruption across whole swathes of the economy - from rail and postal workers to NHS staff and teachers - shows little sign of abating. This is in spite of figures showing public sector pay growth of 4.8 per cent in those months - the strongest since the New Labour era in 2006 if the pandemic period is disregarded. Private sector workers did better with pay up by 7 per cent, but the gap between the two is narrowing. However, everyone feels poorer as double-digit inflation eats into the value of wages. Ministers are facing huge pressure to settle public sector disputes by putting up pay - as well as separate demands to ease the tax burden on struggling businesses and to give the armed forces a much-needed boost in defence spending. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), joins a rally and protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London yesterday Strikes due this week include a walkout on London's Tube trains today and stoppages on other rail lines tomorrow and on Saturday. Rail and Tube passengers face day of chaos today as unions shut down Underground in walkout over pay with more chaos to come later this week - see if your journey will be affected When is the Tube strike? A strike on the London Underground is taking place on Wednesday. This will also affect services into Thursday morning. The strike by members of the RMT and Aslef unions relates to an ongoing dispute over pay, pensions, job losses and working conditions. How will Tube services be affected today? Little or no service is expected across the entire Tube network today. Based on previous strike days, there could be infrequent shuttle services on the outskirts of some lines, but these should not be replied upon. Will London Overground services run today? London Overground services are expected to run mostly as normal today, but they will be much busier than usual and queuing systems could be in place. Transport for London also warned the closure of Tube stations could mean some services will be unable to stop at all stations or run to their normal destination. How will Elizabeth line services be affected today? No service on the Elizabeth line is expected between Paddington and Abbey Wood or Stratford before 7.30am or after 10.30pm today. Services will also be much busier than normal and queuing systems may be in place, and trains may not be able to stop at all stations due to the closure of Tube stations. Will Docklands Light Railway run today? DLR services and trams should run as normal today, although the closure of Underground stations may mean some services will be unable to stop at all stations. TfL also warned there will be no step-free access for the DLR at Bank today - and if the station is able to open, the Monument entrance will have to be used. Will the Tube strike affect buses today? Bus services should run as normal today but will be much busier, particularly from mainline railway stations. How will Tube and Overground services be affected tomorrow? Tomorrow, Tube services will start later than normal and will be disrupted through the morning. London Overground, trams and DLR trains are expected to run as normal. How will Elizabeth line services be affected tomorrow? There is also a separate National Rail strike starting on Thursday which will affect the Elizabeth line. Services between Paddington and Abbey WoodStratford will start later than normal tomorrow. There will also be no Elizabeth line between Shenfield and Brentwood before 7am and after 11pm, and no service between Maidenhead and Reading before 7am and after 7pm. There will be no westbound service from Paddington until 7am. Will the Tube be affected by the National Rail strike on Saturday? Most TfL services should run as normal on Saturday, however there are various engineering works taking place which could impact journeys. In addition, the Elizabeth line will be affected by the National Rail strike on both days - with roughly the same service patterns as outlined in the above answer. What closures will there be on the Tube network this Saturday? There are a series of closures on the Tube network planned for Saturday: Circle line - No service until 8.30am on the entire lineDistrict line - No service until 8.30am on the entire line. No service between Whitechapel and Barking until 2pm. No service between Barking and Upminster from 2pm.Hammersmith  City line - No service until 2pm on the entire lineMetropolitan line - No service between Wembley Park and Aldgate until 8.30amWaterloo  City line - No service What closures will there be on the London Overground network this Saturday? No service between Richmond and Willesden JunctionNo service between South Tottenham and Barking RiversideNo service between Highbury  Islington and New Cross  Clapham Junction  Crystal Palace  West CroydonAdvertisement Teachers are striking in England today and tomorrow and there is also a three-day walk-out by junior doctors this week. Yesterday, a senior health chief warned that the NHS cannot 'go on like this' and urged the Government to strike a deal with the unions as soon as possible. Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers said: 'Unlike previous strikes, it is noticeable that there has been no let-up in the demand for care. 'Senior doctors are stepping into the breach but it is not business as usual. The knock-on effects of a three-day strike will be felt for a long time to come,' he added. Multiple rows over pay and conditions have been rumbling on for months across many different parts of the economy. Last year the number of days lost to strikes totalled 2.47million, the highest level since 1989 when Margaret Thatcher was in power and more than 4million days were lost. It was even worse earlier in the decade with more than 27 million days lost in 1984. The disruption peaked in 1979 with more than 29million days lost, including 12million in September alone that year. The new figures pale in comparison, but show a steadily worsening pattern since last summer. In August, 357,000 days were lost and in September it was 210,000 while October saw the number tick up to 422,000. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the National Education Union said: 'We do not want to go on strike - we want to be in the classroom, teaching and supporting children and young people. 'It continues to be a regret that our members have to take strike action, but we know that parents and the public understand the gravity of the situation around school funding and teacher recruitment and retention. 'The NEU, as we have always stated, is prepared to enter talks at any point, and as and when through negotiation a reasonable offer from Government is made we will pause strike action while the offer is put to members. 'This is exactly what happened last week in Wales. Gillian Keegan (Education Secretary) needs to take a leaf out of the Welsh Government's book, stop playing politics and get down to serious negotiation.' Passengers were urged to check before travelling by Tube in London because of disruption caused by a strike by members of Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT). In a letter to the London mayor, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: 'As you know, at this moment, London Underground managers are imposing new rosters across our Tube stations which are based on cutting 600 station staff jobs. 'In January, I wrote to you raising my serious concerns about the safety consequences of these cuts. Because they are now so short-staffed, managers appear to be mis-using waivers in order to override agreed minimum safe staffing levels at Tube stations. 'This means that stations are now opening with too few or, in some cases, no staff. I asked for a moratorium on these station staff cuts while an investigation took place, yet managers are proceeding with the use of the new rosters.' Finn Brennan of Aslef said the Government's failure to properly fund public transport in the capital is to blame. He warned further strikes are 'inevitable' unless the row is resolved. Glynn Barton, Transport for London's chief operating officer, said: 'Customers should check before they travel and we are advising them to expect very limited or no service on the Tube on Wednesday. 'The majority of TfL services will be running as normal but may be subject to last minute changes, including non-stopping at some stations shared with London Underground. 'Disruption should be expected on the Tube network into the morning on Thursday.' Members of the National Union of Journalists working at BBC Local across England will stage a 24-hour strike in a row over programme cuts. Meanwhile junior doctors in the British Medical Association will continue with a three-day stoppage they launched on Monday over pay. NHS Providers chief executive Sir Julian Hartley said: 'So far, so difficult for the NHS - but the health service is still there for patients. 'Unlike previous strikes, it is noticeable that there has been no let-up in the demand for care. 'Senior doctors are stepping into the breach but it is not business as usual. For hospital patients that means it is taking longer for admissions and the discharge process is also slower. 'Ambulance handover delays are up too. 'We are seeing increased levels of cover by senior doctors in mental health and community services but it is not sustainable and trust leaders are worried about 'burning goodwill'. 'The planning effort involved in preparing for the strike and keeping services going has been huge and has taken leaders' time away from other work. We cannot go on like this. The knock-on effects of a three-day strike will be felt for a long time to come. 'We need the Government and the doctors' unions to come to an agreement quickly.' Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: 'Our members in the public sector have seen their incomes decline by up to 26 per cent over the past 13 years and their work taken for granted - they have had enough. 'Poor pay and declining morale represent an existential threat to the Civil Service's ability to function, and to our ability to regulate and deliver on the Government's priorities. 'Bills are rocketing and pay is falling ever further behind the private sector leaving our members with no option but to take industrial action. 'We will continue our campaign until the Government comes up with a meaningful offer. If it does not do so soon, we may be left with no Civil Service to protect.' Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said in an open letter to parents: 'This industrial action will mean more disruption to children's education and to your lives too - whether that is work, arranging childcare or changing other plans. 'I am extremely disappointed that many young people will once again miss invaluable time learning with their teachers and friends, particularly after their education was significantly disrupted during the pandemic. 'It is made worse by the fact that this strike action is completely unnecessary. As I said to the NEU three weeks ago, I want to get around the table and engage in serious talks on teachers' pay and other issues to resolve disputes. 'My only condition was that strike action is paused so those discussions can take place in good faith and without disruption. 'This was the same offer, and the same condition, made to unions representing nurses, ambulance workers and physiotherapists. Those unions accepted that offer, paused their strikes and are now negotiating on behalf of their members in private. 'The NEU instead seems focused on strikes and all the needless disruption that brings. 'This morning I have written to the unions again to invite them to have those talks on Wednesday and Thursday this week - all they need to do is call off strikes which are unnecessary and benefit no-one.' How will you be affected by the National Rail strike tomorrow and on Saturday? When is the next National Rail strike?

Here is what we know so far: The accident occurred at around 11:30 pm on Tuesday (2130 GMT) near Larissa in the Tempe Valley of Thessaly, central Greece, about 380 kilometres (236 miles) north of Athens, on the main railway line between the capital and Thessaloniki. The passenger train, with 342 passengers and ten employees on board, slammed head-on into a freight train travelling on the same track in the opposite direction, officials said. A fire broke out, apparently in the restaurant car that was among the three leading carriages. All ten train employees are believed to have died in the crash. ALSO READ: Train accident in Greece kills at least 32 At least 47 people have been confirmed dead by the fire department, but several more are known to have been trapped in the restaurant car and have yet to be extricated. Most of the casualties were in the first three carriages, which included first-class seats. Over 80 people were hurt. Most of the passengers were students returning to Thessaloniki after a long Carnival weekend. ALSO READ: Toll rises to 42 in Greek train crash, minister resigns Fire and rescue crews at the scene said they found apocalyptic scenes reminiscent of a war zone. Once we arrived at the scene of the disaster, our teams found themselves in an apocalyptic landscape, Yiannis Goulas, president of the union of emergency response workers (Ekav), told state broadcaster ERT on Wednesday. People covered in blood were running around asking for help. People strewn across the fields after being thrown out of broken windows, he added. Images of the burned-out, mangled carriages at the front of the passenger train were broadcast live nonstop by media outlets. Two cranes were deployed to help pry apart the crumpled metal to search for survivors and bodies. ALSO READ: Humanitarian crises: Less response in African countries Hours after the crash, the Larissa station manager was arrested after giving a statement to police. The 59-year-old man is being prosecuted for negligent homicide and causing involuntary bodily harm. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everything shows that the drama was, sadly, mainly due to a tragic human error, and Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned over the accident. On Thursday, government spokesman Yiannis Economou said the station manager had confessed his responsibility for the accident. I believe the responsibility, the negligence, the error has been confessed by the station master, Economou said. But he also admitted delays in installing safety safeguards on the route where the accident took place, a result of chronic malaise and decades of failure in state management. ALSO READ: France records 22-ton jump in cocaine seizures Greece's rail network, with a total 2,552 kilometres (1,585 miles) of track, has long been plagued by mismanagement, poor maintenance, obsolete equipment and service delays. The head of the train drivers' union, Kostas Genidounias, said that trains were routed manually, as the electronic (safety) systems have not worked since 2000. In 2017, Greek state rail operator Trainose was acquired by the Italian public company Ferrovie Dello Stato Italiane (FS) and renamed Hellenic Train, part of a sweeping privatisation program mandated by Greece's creditors during the country's decade-long debt crisis. Hellenic Train has been criticised for being unable to provide detailed information on the passengers, hampering the search and rescue operations.

The union said today more than 560 workers in Coventry will walk out on April 16th to 18th and again on April 21st to 23rd in an ongoing dispute over pay that has already seen members take eight days of strike action. GMB also said its members at five other fufillment centres in the Midlands will begin balloting over industrial action, specifically in Mansfield, Coalville, Kegworth, Rugeley and Rugby. The union said the ballots would run for several weeks. GMB senior organiser Amanda Gearing said: Industrial action is growing, and this could fast become a summer of strike chaos at Amazon. Three months ago, Amazon told our members there was no money left for pay rises, yet through pressure, campaigning and strike action we have forced Amazon to sit up and take notice. Six further days of strike action in Coventry is a clear statement from our members they are worth more; they will not accept a pay rise of pennies from one of the world's wealthiest corporations. With workers at five further sites starting ballots for industrial action this month, it is clear Amazon need to urgently get serious and talk pay with GMB now. Workers at the Coventry warehouse staged the first strike in the UK in Amazon's history on January 25th, following an industrial action ballot that saw 98 vote to strike on a turnout of more than 63. GMB said members had voted to strike in anger over the company's 50p-per-hour pay offer. According to the union, its members currently receive 10.50 per hour. GMB has called for pay to be increased to 15 per hour. Amazon told ITV News in December that the company offers competitive pay which starts at a minimum of between 10.50 and 11.45 per hour depending on location, which it said represents a 29 increase since 2018. GMB announced seven further days of strike action by workers in Coventry last month, with members walking out on February 28th and March 2nd, before taking part in a week-long strike from March 13th to 17th. Amazon announced in July 2022 that its total UK revenues rose by 12.6 during the previous year to 23.2bn. Amazon UK Services, the company's warehouse and logistics operation, grew its revenues by just over a quarter to 6.09bn. In an interview with LabourList in December, TUC general secretary Paul Nowak identified Amazon as an employer that unions globally have got to get to grips with, adding that he hopes the strike action by workers in Coventry will be a little bit of the spark that lights the flame.",https://labourlist.org/2023/03/gmb-warns-of-summer-of-strike-chaos-at-amazon-as-it-announces-six-new-dates/,0,"More than 560 workers in Coventry will walk out on April 16th to 18th and again on April 21st to 23rd in ongoing dispute over pay.

The Theseus crude tanker was in the Gulf of Guinea on Monday, according to data from MarineTraffic. The tanker loaded with what is believed to be Russian crude oil departed from Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk at the end of January. It arrived close to Ghana's coasts at the end of February, but it had been anchored off the shore waiting for permission to dock and discharge the cargo. The 600,000 barrels of crude that the tanker carried from Novorossiysk to Ghana were the first observed cargo from Russia to the African country in at least four years, according to Bloomberg. The six-week wait was prompted by national security concerns, sources said. One of the people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Ghana had allowed the tanker to dock after claims that the crude oil was from Kazakhstan. But according to data from tanker data firms and a port agent for Novorossiysk, the tanker was shipping Russian crude. The buyer of the cargo, believed to be Platon Gas Oil Ghana Ltd, is not expected to process the crude for at least six months, and will store the oil in storage tanks it has leased from the Tema oil refinery, where the cargo was delivered this weekend, according to local energy experts. Apart from Asia, Russia has turned to Africa to sell more of its crude oil, after the EU embargoes on seaborne imports of Russia's oil and fuels. Ghana in West Africa could be a rare occurrence for Russian oil purchases, but countries in North Africa have become key export outlets of Russia's diesel and other petroleum products after the EU ban on imports of Russian fuels took effect in early February.",https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russian-Crude-Cargo-Unloaded-In-Ghana-After-Waiting-For-Six-Weeks.html,1,"An oil tanker that had waited for permission to dock for six weeks was cleared to discharge the oil this weekend.

Lloyd's Register has awarded Approval in Principle (AiP) to Hyundai's new Onboard Guidance System, which is designed to help containerships prevent excessive rolling. The container industry has long struggled to understand the phenomenon known as parametric rolling and how to prevent its impact on vessels. Incident reports have directly linked ships experiencing these sudden onset motions and the loss of containers. Calling a recent increase in the number of containers lost at sea and reversal of the downward trend concerning, the World Shipping Council in 2022 reported that the industry was embarking on a three-year study looking at the causes and how to prevent container damage and loss. Initial results from the WSC-led research had already identified that parametric rolling in following seas as especially hazardous for container vessels. They said that this phenomenon is not well known and can develop unexpectedly with severe consequences. WSC had already supported the industry with new warnings and advisories to marines on steps to recognize and prevent parametric rolling in following seas. The system developed by Hyundai and tested on an Eastern Pacific 15,100 TEU containership in September 2022 evaluates the stability of the roll motion of the containership in operation. The solution considers various loading conditions and sea conditions and provides operation guidance on board based on actual operational information in connection with Hyundai Global Service (HGS)'s Integrated Smartship Solution (ISS). With the development of the technology, our clients are able to reduce unnecessary costs due to the loss of containers and HHI has come to secure differentiated competitiveness as a shipbuilder that ensures safe operation at sea, said Seungho Jeon, Chief Technology Officer for Hyundai Heavy Industries. It also has a significant meaning in that we have established a foundation for further advancing the system by completing a pilot test on the EPS vessels in operation. Lloyd's Register participating in the project also suggested rules, requirements, and guidance for the system as part of the AiP. This software is a crucial tool in preventing Parametric Rolling Movement and improving safety at sea, Nick Gross, Global Containership Segment Director for Lloyd's Register. Container roll can cause a ship to dangerously roll at extreme angles, sometimes culminating in a vessel capsizing. Approval in Principle for HHI's Onboard Guidance System is a meaningful milestone for preventing container roll at sea. LR reports that it is building on its long-standing relationship with HD Hyundai. Among other recent projects, they also recently awarded AiP for two containerships equipped with various measures for mitigating container loss at sea.",https://maritime-executive.com/article/system-to-prevent-boxship-parametric-rolling-receives-aip-from-lr,0,Lloyd's Register has awarded Approval in Principle (AiP) to Hyundai's new Onboard Guidance System.

About 700 demonstrators massed outside the Athens headquarters of Greek rail operator Hellenic Train to voice outrage and sorrow over the country's worst-ever rail disaster. Announcing the 24-hour shutdown, the rail union federation denounced a lack of respect towards Greece's rail network by successive governments over the years, which led to this tragic result. Government spokesman Yiannis Economou said an inquiry would examine the chronic delays in implementing railway works, delays caused by chronic public-sector malaise and decades of failure. - Negligence - Authorities have pointed to human error in explaining the collision in which two carriages were demolished and a restaurant car caught fire, trapping many victims inside. I believe the responsibility, the negligence, the error has been confessed by the station master, Economou told reporters in Athens. The manager acknowledges what he has done, his lawyer confirmed. Train unionists say security problems for the Athens-Thessaloniki railway line had been known for years. The country's transport minister resigned Wednesday, and his replacement on Thursday offered his apologies to families of the victims and vowed a complete evaluation of the political system and the state. I want to say, looking these people straight in the eye, that there will be an inquiry and everything will be presented to Greek citizens, Giorgos Gerapetritis said. Safety systems on the Athens-Thessaloniki line are still not fully automated, five years after the state-owned Greek rail operator Trainose was privatised and sold to Italy's Ferrovie Dello Stato Italiane and became Hellenic Train. Newspaper front pages also played up the alleged shortcomings, with the headline of Kathimerini saying The dead want answers. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after visiting the crash site Wednesday that Everything shows that the drama was, sadly, mainly due to a tragic human error. Angry demonstrators had rallied outside the Athens office of Hellenic Train on Wednesday evening, as police used tear gas to disperse protesters who threw rocks at the building. US President Joe Biden offered his condolences on Thursday for the tragic train accident, adding that We wish those injured a quick and full recovery. - 'Crumpled like paper' - Survivors described scenes of horror and chaos from the crash, many dodging smashed glass and debris as the train keeled over, and breaking windows to climb out. The train's restaurant car erupted in flames after the collision, with temperatures inside reaching 1,300 degrees Celsius (2,370 Fahrenheit), the fire department said. For hours after the crash it was not immediately clear how many people were on board, complicating efforts to determine how many are missing. Roubini Leontari, the chief coroner at Larissa's general hospital, told state broadcaster ERT on Thursday that over 10 people were still unaccounted for, including two Cyprus nationals.",https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/outrage-as-greece-admits-failures-after-dea-1652554.html,1,"About 700 demonstrators massed outside the Athens headquarters of Greek rail operator Hellenic Train to voice outrage and sorrow over the country's worst-ever rail disaster. Announcing the 24-hour shutdown, the rail union federation denounced a lack of respect towards Greece's rail network by successive governments over the years. Government spokesman Yiannis Economou said an inquiry would examine the chronic delays in implementing railway works, delays caused by chronic public-sector malaise and decades of failure. Authorities have pointed to human error in explaining the collision in which two carriages were demolished and a restaurant car caught fire."

The Labour Court in Johannesburg upheld an interdict to stop a strike by National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) strike on Monday evening. The union had appealed against the interdict first filed on Saturday. Nehawu kicked off a countrywide strike early on Monday with reports of intimidation stopping health workers from entering or leaving health facilities, cancelled surgeries and ambulances barred from entering or leaving hospitals, with many other critical services grinding to a halt. Read more in Daily Maverick: Wage strike hammers health services across the country The judgment states the strike will likely because irreparable harm to the government and affect numerous public services including education, health, police, home affairs, social development and correctional services. The applicant submitted that the appeal has no prospects of success given that the collective agreement that the union seeks to compel the applicant to conclude would be contrary to regulated measures in the form of Public Service Regulations. The Department of Public Service and Administration and its Minister argued that the fiscal year had not begun and the unions, therefore, did not know the financial allocations and could not yet make demands. Nehawu's KwaZulu-Natal branch closed 80 health facilities around the province, according to the union's provincial secretary Ayanda Blessing Zulu. Daily Maverick has not been able to corroborate Zulu's claim. The head offices of education, public works and cooperative governance were closed. Water and sanitation offices; sports, arts and culture were closed; social development were also closed. The strike is indefinite until our demands are met, Zulu said. Patients at Pietermaritzburg's East Boom Community Health Centre were not able to access the facility. Burning tyres and litter blocked the entrance to Umgeni Hospital in Howick. Patients visiting the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha and Mthatha General Hospital to receive critical - and at times overdue - treatment from their doctors were angry on Monday after being told to make a new appointment for another day. Wheelchair-bound Mzikayise Mabhongo, from Upper Xhongorha, was among those who were left frustrated on Monday afternoon when they were turned away at the gate. I arrived here in the morning today for a review and as you can see I am using a wheelchair. It was a hectic day. After meeting with my doctor I was told to collect medication, but the medication room was locked due to the strike. I did not receive any treatment today; it was just a waste of time and my money, Mabhongo said. Another patient Masibe Mangiso, who also uses a wheelchair, said he was told to make another appointment for next Monday because of the strike. We are patients here and they are supposed to assist us. I am hiring a bakkie for R300 to get from Qunu Village to here. Today we feel neglected as patients. Government needs to take this seriously. People are going to lose their lives, he said. Meanwhile, Monwabisi Mesilani, who was accompanying his wife, Nombulelo Qhinga, said he was angry at how they were treated on Monday. We are coming from Mqanduli with R45 each in a taxi. Just imagine coming here for nothing. It is really painful, and I do not know what will happen to my wife overnight; she did not get any assistance today, Mesilani said. Emergency medical services elsewhere in the Eastern Cape were heavily affected. Several hospitals and clinics offered only limited services and many patients wanting to collect medication were turned away. The dispatch of ambulances from the control room at Dora Nginza Hospital in Nelson Mandela Bay was interrupted after control room staff were removed from their workstations. Livingstone Hospital in Gqeberha stopped all elective surgeries and performed emergency surgery only. Protesters shut the gates to both Livingstone and Dora Nginza hospitals for a while, but they were later reopened. Protesters burnt tyres on the road in Zwide leading to Dora Nginza Hospital, which is the centre for maternal and paediatric care in the metro. Health officials said they were unsure if tyres burning in the road in front of the hospital were related to the Nehawu strike. Just before noon, a memorandum was sent from the head of the Eastern Cape health department, Dr Rolene Wagner, giving protesters two hours to return to work, saying that the principle of no work, no pay would apply. Provincial health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said four other unions were not joining the strike. He added that law enforcement agencies were deployed to deal with acts of criminality. Nehawu workers stopped people from entering health facilities and caused disruptions, according to Tebogo Lekgethwane, media and communications manager for the North West health department. Strikers barricaded entrances mainly around the Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp and several district hospitals such as Gelukspan District Hospital, he said. Most health facilities in the province were affected by the strike, Lekgethwane said, but some services returned in the afternoon when the police were called in. On Monday night, a doctor at Tshepong Hospital said no nurses had been allowed in by 8pm, patients had not received their medication and were unlikely to be served dinner. The strike is still ongoing, the doctor said. Strikers allowed a few doctors in, but no nurses. Doctors cannot provide meds, feed patients and ensure observation is being done as well as the turning of very ill patients. So right now patients and doctors are helpless, he said. He said they had information that the hospital management was meeting with the provincial health department but had not received an update. Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela has reportedly been closed, while Ermelo Regional Hospital in Ermelo is partially functional. The Free State health department's spokesperson, Mondli Mvambihave, said the department had received information that members of Nehawu had barricaded access and disrupted services at the Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Regional Hospital and Elizabeth Ross in Qwaqwa, Fezi Ngubentombi in Sasolburg, Boitumelo Hospital in Kroonstad and Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein. He said the department had contacted law enforcement agencies to ensure patients' constitutional right to health was not infringed by those participating in the strike. It is unclear so far as to who is actively participating in the strike as services have not ground to a complete halt, he said. Health workers confirmed to Daily Maverick earlier on Monday that Pelonomi and Universitas hospitals had been affected, with protesters blocking the entrances to both, resulting in surgery being cancelled. In many cases patients had been waiting months for critical surgery, a doctor confirmed. No nursing or support staff were allowed to enter Pelonomi to work. The protesters were incredibly militant and aggressive, burning tyres and throwing rocks at vehicles, said a health worker. The gates at Leratong Hospital in Krugersdorp reportedly closed at about 4am, preventing anybody from entering or leaving the hospital. A skeleton staff ventilated patients in the wards. Staff working the night shift at the hospital were met with burning tyres blocking movement in and out of the hospital. Patients seeking help at Carletonville Hospital were sent home. The hospital issued a statement on its Facebook page, urging patients and visitors to exercise caution when accessing the facility, and said it was working on mitigating any risk related to service delivery disruption as a result of the national strike. We remain open for emergency cases and EMS will continue to service critical cases, the statement added. Thelle Mogoerane Regional Hospital in Vosloorus, Helen Joseph Hospital in Auckland Park, Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, and Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital in Krugersdorp were reportedly also affected. The entrances to Helen Joseph Hospital and Chris Hani Baragwanath were blocked with burning tyres. Affected Gauteng facilities also include Bheki Mlangeni District Hospital, Thelle Mogoerane Regional Hospital, Tembisa Provincial Tertiary Hospital, Goba Clinic, Magagula Clinic, in Ekurhuleni, Kopanong Hospital, Sebokeng Regional Hospital, Heidelberg District Hospital, Johan Heyns Community Health Centre, Levai Mbatha Community Health Centre, Sebokeng Zone 17 Clinic in Sedibeng and West Rand District Hospital.

Here is what we learned from testimony,"HALIFAX -- Just shy of three years after the worst mass shooting in Canadian history, the Mass Casualty Commission inquiry will release its final report Thursday on what happened before, during and after the horrific 13 hours in April 2020, when a gunman killed 22 people, burned homes and terrorized much of northern Nova Scotia. The report -- 3,000 pages in seven volumes -- brings to a close the MCC's two-and-a-half-year, 20-million-plus probe into not only what happened, but why it happened and how to prevent it happening again. On April 18 and 19, Gabriel Wortman, a 51-year-old denturist, went on a shooting rampage dressed in an RCMP uniform and in a replica RCMP car, killing 22 people, including a pregnant woman, beginning in Portapique and ending almost 100 kilometres away in Enfield, when police caught up with him and shot him. It is a 13-hour period that traumatized a province and forever changed the lives of scores of his victims' family members and survivors. The inquiry into that shooting raised questions about RCMP response, procedures and attitudes toward victims and the public, how we as a society treat domestic violence and even about how to conduct future similar inquiries. Here are some of the things we learned during the inquiry that followed. The evening that ended in bloodshed, flames and anguish began with an anniversary celebration. The shooter and his common-law spouse, Lisa Banfield, began the evening celebrating their 19th year together with drinks in their Portapique warehouse and had a video chat with friends in the United States. At some point, that devolved into an argument, the assault and temporary imprisonment of Banfield in a replica RCMP vehicle, her subsequent escape and Wortman going on a shooting rampage in the neighbourhood, killing 13 of his neighbours and torching several of their houses along with his own. It began with the shooting of Greg Blair on the front deck of his house and his wife, Linda, as she barricaded their bedroom door with her body, trying to protect their children. The children, undetected after their mother's death, fled through the darkness to their neighbours' house, where they called 911. The Portapique shootings ended that night with the gunning down of Corrie Ellison outside the killer's burning warehouse. But questions persist over the timeline of the killer's movements. That is important, because it speaks to whether he had left Portapique before -- or very soon after -- the RCMP arrived at the scene, or whether he left later, after police presence was established. If it is the latter, it raises the question about the adequacy of RCMP containment effort -- had they managed to confine the killer to Portapique, nine lives might have been saved the following day. While there is solid evidence about the time of the death of the shooter's last victim, Corrie Ellison, there is some ambiguity in testimonies on the moments following that. One witness described seeing, at about 10:45 p.m., a car speeding up a dirt road known to locals as the blueberry field road toward Brown Loop, which connected with Highway 2 east of Portapique Beach Road. But another witness testified to having his car parked on Brown Loop during that time, and not seeing any cars, let alone a replica RCMP vehicle. After dodging the police in Portapique, the shooter spent the night in an industrial park in Debert before resuming his rampage. His first victims that day were Sean McLeod and Alanna Jenkins, 50 kilometres north in Wentworth. After killing them and setting their house afire, he killed their neighbour, Tom Bagley, as he came to help. At this point, the RCMP knew the gunman was driving a replica police car. They would been told that by witnesses the previous night and by Banfield when she emerged from hiding in the early morning. Yet it was still several hours before they told the public about it -- via Twitter at 10:17 a.m. In the interim, the shooter randomly killed three more people -- including the pregnant Kristen Beaton -- at the side of the road. Her widower, Nick Beaton, has said that if he had the information the police did about the replica car, he would not have let his wife go out that day. That replica police car also played a part in the non-fatal shooting of RCMP Const. Chad Morrison -- who thought he was meeting Const. Heidi Stevenson -- and the fatal shootings of both Stevenson and bystander Joey Webber. There was one more victim -- Gina Goulet -- a denturist known to both the shooter and Banfield. Oddly, on an anniversary drive the previous day, before the shooting started, Wortman had pointed out Goulet's house to Banfield. Forensic evidence suggests the killer shot Goulet nine times before stealing her car and leaving. It would prove to be his undoing -- there was little fuel in the car. He was spotted by police at a gas station in Enfield moments later and shot and killed. The delay in warning the public and the inefficient means of doing so -- via Twitter rather than using the province's emergency alert system -- was one of the most dissected issues as the inquiry ran its course. The RCMP has since made changes in its protocol regarding the use of the province's emergency alert system. It now sends alerts on a regular basis. In the heat of the manhunt for the killer on April 19, Const. Terry Brown and Const. Dave Melanson opened fire on a colleague sitting in his police car and an RCMP civilian liaison officer outside the Onslow fire hall, about eight kilometres west of Truro. Neither the officer, Const. Dave Gagnon, nor Emergency Management Co-ordinator Dave Westlake was injured, but the hail of bullets ripping into the fire hall caused 43,000 in damage and traumatized Chief Greg Muise and Deputy Fire Chief Darrell Currie, who were inside, along with Richard Ellison, whose son Corrie, had been killed the night before in Portapique. Melanson and Brown opened fire despite having the information on the call sign and the distinctive push bumper of the gunman's replica car and despite Gagnon's car being positioned in such a way that both were viewable. Nova Scotia's independent watchdog later decided that no charges were warranted against either officer. Possibly the most anticipated testimony at the inquiry was that of the killer's common-law spouse. When it came, it was not without controversy. Though she had spoken with police four times in the aftermath of the mass shooting, Banfield, who had been charged by police with providing ammunition to the killer, refused -- through her lawyer -- to testify at the inquiry unless those charges went away. When they did, when she testified at the inquiry, it was with a caveat -- she would only speak to the MCC counsel and would not be cross-examined by lawyers representing the families of the victims. At that point in the inquiry, that state of affairs was not unusual -- several RCMP officers had availed themselves of the same caveat, ostensibly to prevent them from being further traumatized. But in all cases, the lack of independent cross-examination frustrated the victims' families and created the perception that truth that was being revealed might not have been the full and complete truth, said lawyers for those families. In Banfield's case, the situation was most critical. Because the YOU.S. friends they were speaking to on the night of April 18 were not called to testify, Banfield was the sole witness to the beginning of the mass killing and the only person who could possibly answer the question: Why? And though her testimony touched on the gunman's anger issues, his pattern of domestic violence and of the events of that first night, the families of the victims had questions about gaps in her story that were not filled by the commission counsel -- how she managed to escape the back of the police car the gunman trapped her in, and how she managed a subfreezing night in the woods after throwing away her coat in her escape, for example. Further details on the gunman began to emerge as the inquiry progressed. Although many who met him portrayed him as pleasant and affable, he had a long history of domestic violence that dated back to nearly the beginning of his relationship with Banfield. Neighbours and police were aware of it, and it was reported to police, but the RCMP took no firm action. He also had a violent streak -- enough so that those around him, including Banfield, feared the repercussions of involving the police. Wortman's cousin -- himself an ex-RCMP officer -- told RCMP after the fact that Wortman put himself through university by smuggling alcohol and tobacco across the border in Houlton, Maine. He described Wortman to police as almost a career criminal. The cousin said he decided, as a police officer, that he had to keep his distance from Wortman. That same cousin also confirmed a report of Wortman brutally beating his own father during a family trip to the Dominican Republic in 2016. It was also known that he had a collection of guns, some of which he would smuggled in from the YOU.S. That too was reported to police but no action was taken. Many early initial questions for the RCMP revolved around when and how it discovered that the killer was dressed in one of their uniforms and driving a replica police car, why the Mounties waited several hours to inform the public of this and why, when they eventually did so, they spurned the use of the province's emergency alert system in favour of social media. (They have since adapted their protocol for the use of the emergency alert system.) But as the inquiry progressed, more questions arose about the police initial response to the reports of shooting in Portapique. Why was the gunman allowed to escape Portapique -- apparently on a dirt road that police did not know about -- that night? Why did the RCMP seem to have inadequate mapping of the area and apparently no one with first-hand knowledge? Why were containment efforts concentrated to the west of Portapique and none to the east in the directions the killer eventually escaped? In their initial response to 911 calls about the shooting, Staff Sgt. Brian Rehill, the officer in charge, sent three RCMP officers -- forming an Immediate Action Rapid Deployment (IARD) team -- into Portapique to hunt for the gunman. When reinforcements arrived later, Sgt. Andy O'Brien told the new arrivals to stay put at the head of Portapique Beach Road, fearing that in the dark officers might shoot at each other. It was more than 90 minutes before any other RCMP officers joined the initial IARD team searching Portapique for the man who killed 13 people there that night. In fact, the RCMP had the means to track each of their officers that night, by way of a GPS system incorporated into their hand-held radios. But that system had not been activated, and the IARD team members themselves were not even aware it existed. Within its ranks, the RCMP also had to deal with conflict between the provincial RCMP and its federal counterparts as then-Commissioner Brenda Lucki faced allegations of interference in the mass shooting investigation by lobbying to have the details of the guns used in the shooting released. Lucki had promised the Prime Minister's Office and then Public Safety minister Bill Blair that those details would be included in an upcoming press conference and she lambasted Nova Scotia Chief Supt. Darren Campbell when he omitted them, concerned that he would compromise the investigation. At the outset, MCC commissioner Michael McDonald made it clear that the inquiry's mandate was not about assigning blame, but about understanding what happened before, during and after the mass shooting, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again. He also said the inquiry would be taking a trauma-informed approach, to minimize the risk of re-traumatizing those who had been already affected by their connections to the mass shooting. But as the inquiry progressed, eyebrows were raised as on a near-weekly basis lawyers for the RCMP and the Department of Justice used that approach as the basis for arguments that police officers should a) not testify before the inquiry at all, b) testify before the inquiry by remote video conference, or c) testify before the commission counsel but not be subject to cross examination by independent counsel. Disingenuous or not, to some observers, that behaviour skewed the balance between trauma sensitivity and the need to get the truth. And in doing so, exacerbated trust issues, both between the public and the RCMP, and between public and the inquiry itself.",https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/03/29/nova-scotia-mass-shooting-inquiry-is-releasing-its-final-report-heres-what-we-learned-from-testimony.html,0,"The Mass Casualty Commission inquiry will release its final report Thursday.

Many had been lying empty for years and had become a blot on the landscape for local people and tourists alike. So almost six years later, we decided to take a look at what has happened to them all. Surprisingly progress has only been made on a small number out of the eight, although the others have all featured in plans that have come to nothing so far. Here, we take a look at the sites - including the Assembly Rooms, in the Market Place; the former Hippodrome Theatre, in Green Lane; and derelict Duckworth Square - and ask what has happened since 2017? 1) Assembly Rooms, Derby Market Place When we first did the article in 2017, the Assembly Rooms had been standing unused for three years, exactly as it was on the night that fire broke out in the adjacent car park on March 14, 2014, and it had never re-opened. Grandiose plans were put forward in 2016 to knock down the Assembly Rooms and replace it with a state-of-the-art building which would cost up to 70m. Some funding was forthcoming from D2N2 but it came to nothing because a change of council control in 2018 led to plans for the building to remain and be refurbished instead. This was fine until structural problems led to the cost increasing from an estimated 10 million to 30 million. Shortly after this, it was decided to build a 45 million performance venue in the Becketwell area of the city. Land acquisition and demolition have taken place to prepare for this and work is due to get underway soon with a completion date in 2025. In the meantime, the Brutalist-style Assembly Rooms is still empty and derelict in the Market Place with the threat of demolition hanging over it. Despite petitions and appeals from supporters of the building, the city's planning and control committee approved its demolition providing an alternative plan for something to replace it is approved by 2026 - five years after planning permission for demolition was given. To date, it has been suggested that a replacement Derby Theatre is built in the Market place on the Assembly Rooms site but with only 20 million in the kitty for a project likely to costs at least 60 million, it looks as if the conclusion to the Assembly Rooms saga could still be some time away, especially as experts have suggested that the present theatre should not move from the Derbion centre until a plan for homes is approved. 2) Former Hippodrome Theatre, Green Lane The Grade-II listed building, in Green Lane, remains unchanged, unused and at risk, at least according to the Theatres Trust. In the past couple of years, some things have happened including some grant funding to carry out initial exploratory work by the Derby Hippodrome Restoration Trust. There have also been initial steps to bring a new live music venue to the city centre by an inaugural gathering of some of the area's promoters, musicians and festival organisers. Consultant's advice was to get young people involved from the very start to ensure they are fully engaged in the civic and cultural life of the city. At the same time, acknowledging there is plenty of work to do to restore the dilapidated and arson-hit theatre, the meeting was intended to explore what could take place there once the job of putting the 3D jigsaw together was complete. The building which is now owned by Planet International, has been deteriorating slowly over the past 10 years and a serious fire in 2015 led many people to believe it did not have a future. Proposed development of the Hippodrome Theatre could begin with phase one focusing on creating offices, workshops, a caf, and outdoor areas with temporary facilities as pop-ups. It could then progress to phase two providing space for a permanent music venue, possibly including a nightclub or other live music provision in the basement with up to a 500-audience capacity. If developed together, it is estimated that construction costs would be around 6.5 million and a total project cost of 8 million excluding site acquisition. A longer-term plan would involve a third phase, which could be the creation of an additional music venue with a capacity of 1,000 - which at first would be likely to be programmed three or four times a week to meet current market demand. 3) Former DRI site in London Road In 2017, councillors had deferred making a decision on plans for a new 500-home neighbourhood on the former Derbyshire Royal Infirmary site. As well as homes and a park, other proposed uses on the 18.5-acre site, part of the city's Nightingale Quarter, included commercial, leisure, retail and food and drink. Since then work on the 150 million city centre development on the former Derbyshire Royal Infirmary site, off London Road, is continuing to progress after getting underway in 2020. The 18.5-acre site is being transformed into new homes by property developers Wavensmere Homes. The former infirmary's pepper pot buildings are being retained for community use, with residents having access to numerous facilities, including a caf, exhibition space and meeting rooms. Other facilities include cycle paths, an outdoor gym and a children's play area, as well as six acres of green open space. 4) Former Smith Clockworks, 27-28 Queen Street Nothing concrete has happened to ensure this building continues for generations to come. Rebuilt by celebrated scientist John Whitehurst in 1764 using designs from architect Joseph Pickford, it became home to Derby's most famous artist, Joseph Wright, in 1793. In 1865, local clockmaker John Smith moved his business into the building. Smith's Clocks moved out in 1999 and it was transferred to the current owner, Joseph DeWinter. Despite its great history, the building is derelict and has been home to squatters. In autumn 2015, it was put on the market for 750,000 but it is believed to be worth much more. More recently, Derby Civic Society has announced it will once again try to have the building listed in order to prevent its possible demolition. 5) Friar Gate Goods Yard, Derby The size of eight football pitches, this site has been derelict for over 50 years. It was once part of the Great Northern Railway and included Friar Gate station. Services stopped operating from the station in 1963 and from the goods yard in 1968. Historic buildings on the site include a now-roofless bonded warehouse and 10 railway arches attached to Friar Gate Bridge. Planning permission was granted to Clowes - the site's owner for the past 30 years - in October 2011 for homes, offices, cafes and shops, while turning the Grade II-listed warehouse into a supermarket. But a downturn in the fortune of supermarkets put paid to the latter idea. The owners have said a high-value use for the warehouse, such as retail, bars and restaurants, was still needed to make restoring it affordable. More recently, at the beginning of this year, it was revealed that fresh plans have been revealed for the site, off Stafford Street, which could see the former bonded warehouse and the engine house saved and restored as part of a new multi-million-pound development that would transform the city. Details were in a report sent to Derby City Council planners. The document reveals plans to build up to 300 homes on the site, predominantly comprising houses, with some apartments also planned. The developer also intends to restore the bonded warehouse and the engine house on the site for shops, restaurants, cafs and offices. 6) Friar Gate Bridge, Derby Another eyesore where nothing has happened. The ornate bridge, constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co, was part of the western extension of the Great Northern Railway and opened in 1878. When the line closed in 1967, the Grade II-listed structure began to deteriorate. It was sold by British Rail to the city council for 1 on the understanding it would be looked after by the authority. The Friends of Friar Gate Bridge was formed with the goal of fully restoring the structure, which has been described as in a disgraceful state by Derby Civic Society. It was said in 2022 that it was hoped that Friar Gate Bridge can be renovated under the same scheme as Friar Gate Goods Yard above but so far no detailed plans have been revealed. 7) Debenhams, Victoria Street In 2017, Derby's former Debenhams building was put up for sale by the city council in June, after obtaining it from the previous owners, Intu. It was demolished in 2020 and the site has been used for the building of two large apartment blocks containing 259 flats, the first of which will be occupied in the next couple of weeks, as part of the Becketwell development. 8) Duckworth Square, Derby In 2017, one of Derby's biggest eyesores was set to become a 10 million ice rink by 2020. But the idea was thrown out with a change of council in 2018 and now the area is shaping up as part of the Becketwell development with the construction of a public square adjacent to the two large apartment blocks above on the former Debenhams site. The 200 million makeover of Becketwell will see a public square built as well as a 3,500-capacity performance venue. We send the biggest stories out every day as part of our newsletter.

With the Coalition under pressure from airlines after drones disrupted operations at the airport, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan and Minister of State Jack Chambers will outline a plan to Cabinet on Tuesday for drone security at the airport, and the wider issue of protecting critical infrastructure from interference. However, on Monday night, DAA, which operates the airport, warned that it did not want long-term responsibility for intercepting drones in its airspace. DAA will be approved by the Government as the operator of counter-drone technology and will be told to purchase the system and operate it.

It is important we assess the wider infrastructure across the State and procure, where necessary or where recommended, counter-drone technology. And that is what we are going to do, Mr Chambers told RT on Monday. The Government did not respond to queries on Monday evening as to whether the DAA would have ongoing responsibility for policing against drones, or whether it would transfer to the agency deemed appropriate for other vital assets. Currently, the airport has equipment to detect drones but not to interfere with their operation. DAA will have to select a provider, with the timeline from manufacturers for delivery unclear.

It is heartbreaking, Londoo, 26, said. People should be able to make those decisions when they are ready and not because they are forced into certain situations. Latinas and Black women working to keep abortions accessible in Florida worry the new law will result in more people of color being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term -- which often result in worse economic and mental health outcomes. While reproductive age women of all races and ethnicities are at risk of unintended pregnancy, Hispanic and Black women face a disproportionally higher risk, according to research published in 2020 in the peer-reviewed journal Contraception and Reproductive Medicine. The conditions of our state, people not being able to afford abortion care, these are going to keep people pregnant against their will, ultimately, Florida Access Network co-executive director Stephanie Loraine Pieiro, who heads the only abortion fund led by queer people of color in the state, said. The law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday night will take effect only if Florida's current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court. Bienvenido US, a Hispanic conservative national group, celebrated the news on Friday calling it A PRO LIFE VICTORY! on Twitter. The Radiance Foundation, a faith-based nonprofit group founded by African-American pro-life activist Ryan Bomberger, shared a post on Facebook celebrating the abortion ban saying, We will not stop this humanrights fight until every life is protected from the violence of abortion and the predators who profit from fear and pain. Florida is home to 828,100 Black women of reproductive age. Among the 1.4 million Latinas of reproductive age, 570,000 are economically insecure and 585,200 are already mothers, according to a November report. For Black and brown people in the state, giving birth can present an additional set of dangers and concerns given its high rates of maternal mortality. Some also face systemic barriers such as lack of heath insurance, health care literacy and access to culturally and linguistically competent health systems, as well as discriminatory policies that make it difficult for people to access routine health care, Aurelie Coln-Larrauri, the Florida state policy advocate for the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said. Forcing anyone in marginalized communities to continue their pregnancy, because they cannot terminate them, may actually contribute to an increase of maternal mortality rates in the state of Florida, Coln-Larrauri said. Coln-Larrauri and Piero worry about how many people will forego abortion care because they cannot travel or afford the procedure. This six week abortion ban is effectively a total ban, Piero said, adding that it is often not enough time for people to find out they are pregnant, figure out how to pay for the procedure, secure traveling and lodging logistics, and in some cases child care. It is not realistic, and that is by design, she added. A recent Turnaway Study from demographer Diana Greene Foster, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco, found that women who had been denied abortion access experienced worse economic and mental health outcomes than women who had received care and that 95 of study participants who received abortions said they made the right decision. The new Florida law contains some exceptions, including to save the woman's life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation like a restraining order or police report. In the work Jamarah Amani as done as the executive director of the Southern Birth Justice Network and member of the coalition Black in Repro, she has witnessed how these exceptions do not actually play out in the way that we think they will. She has seen it with the 15-week abortion ban currently in place. There have been situations where people have had to go to other states, or they have had to carry pregnancies against their will, because they did not have proper documentation, Amani, who is also a midwife, said. In cases where the woman's life is at risk, Amani worries about doctors waiting too long to act on behalf of their pregnant patients because it is not always clear how at-risk should patients need to be in order for doctors to avoid litigation, criminal penalties or even losing their licenses. These further restrictions placed on abortion care, make a medically safe practice legally dangerous, and endangers the lives in the process, Coln-Larrauri said. The bill also includes 25 million to expand Florida Pregnancy Care Network Inc., a statewide network of nonprofit groups that provides services by often subcontracting crisis pregnancy centers, which are known to provide inaccurate or misleading information about abortions to pregnant people. What we need is investments in legitimate health care, Amani said, and abortion funds to help people get those early abortions, which will hopefully still be legal. As advocates wait for a Florida court to determine the fate of the new abortion ban, the Florida Access Network will continue debunking the rising abortion misinformation that often follows when a new law is passed and ramp up fundraising efforts to be ready for an increase in patients that may need to travel outside of Florida to get the procedure, Pieiro said. After Texas passed its six-week abortion law months ago, many independent abortion clinics shut down or ended up drastically increasing their prices. Pieiro fears the same will happen in Florida. The abortion care people will need is getting appointments and tangibly helping them pay for travel, Pieiro said. As a mother raising Black children, Amani worries about how these laws are reviving a painful legacy in which our ancestors were forced to breed and not being able to decide anything about their bodies. It is just crazy that in 2023, I am handing that world, again, to my children, she said. It is a matter of life and death, and we want our lives. People that are in power should not be able to make death sentence decisions for any group of people, Amani added. Londoo agrees. People should be able to decide when and if to start a family -- on their own time, when they are ready, and under their own circumstances, she said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/floridas-upcoming-6-week-abortion-ban-will-impact-latina-black-women-rcna79779,0,"Latinas and Black women working to keep abortions accessible in Florida worry the new law will result in more people of color being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.

Check out what is clicking on Foxnews.com. Tens of thousands of junior doctors went on strike across England on Monday to demand better pay, kicking off three days of widespread disruption at the YOU.K.'s state-funded hospitals and health clinics. Junior doctors -- who are qualified but in the earlier years of their career -- make up 45 of all doctors in the National Health Service. Their walkout means that operations and appointments will be canceled for thousands of patients, and senior doctors and other medics have had to be drafted in to cover for emergency services, critical care and maternity services. The British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, says pay for junior doctors has fallen 26 in real terms since 2008, while workload and patient waiting lists are at record highs. The union says burnout and the YOU.K.'s cost-of-living crisis are driving scores of doctors away from the public health service. TRAINS CANCELED, SCHOOLS CLOSED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AFTER BLIZZARD, HEAVY WINDS HIT THE COUNTRY The union said newly qualified medics earn just 17 an hour. All that junior doctors are asking is to be paid a wage that matches our skill set, said Rebecca Lissman, 29, a trainee in obstetrics and gynaecology. We love the NHS, and I do not want to work in private practice, but I think we are seeing the erosion of public services. I want to be in work, looking after people, getting trained. I do not want to be out here striking, but I feel that I have to, she added. Other health workers, including nurses and paramedics, have also staged strikes in recent months to demand better pay and conditions. NHS figures show that more than 100,000 appointments have already been postponed this winter as a result of the nurses' walkouts. Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said the 72-hour strike this week is expected to have the most serious impact and will cause extensive disruption. He said some cancer care will likely be affected, alongside routine appointments and some operations. UK SCHOOL BLASTED FOR REPLACING GIRLS' BATHROOM MIRRORS WITH 'PROVOCATIVE' POSTERS: 'VERY MEDIEVAL' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters on Sunday it was disappointing that the junior doctors' union are not engaging with the government. The doctors' union said officials have refused to engage with their demands for months, and that a recent invitation to talks came with unacceptable preconditions. The doctors' strike this week will coincide with mass walkouts by tens of thousands of teachers and civil servants on Wednesday, the day the government unveils its latest budget statement. A wave of strikes has disrupted Britons' lives for months, as workers demand pay raises to keep pace with soaring inflation, which stood at 10.1 in January. That was down from a November peak of 11.1, but is still the highest in 40 years.

Unlike the SCFI, the WCI showed Shanghai-Los Angeles spot rates down 4 ww, to 1,674 per FEU. The Freightos Baltic Daily Index (FBX) global composite, as of Friday, was down 2 ww. The FBX China-West Coast assessment was flat ww, at 1,005 per FEU. Platts' North Asia-West Coast North America spot-rate assessment was up 19 ww, to 1,250 per FEU, mirroring the trend seen in the SCFI. In contrast, Xeneta's XSI-C short-term rate index for the Far East to the West Coast was essentially flat ww (down 0.5) at 1,151 per FEU on Friday. Talk of a spot-rate floor raises two big questions when considering the broader outlook for liner earnings: What about contract rates, which are more important than spot rates, with trans-Pacific annual contracts for May 2023-April 2024 about to debut? And what about the massive wave of newbuildings that began hitting the market in March, a deluge of new tonnage that will continue through at least 2025? For context on talk of a market bottom, FreightWaves interviewed Omar Nokta, shipping analyst at Jefferies. Up until recently, you could almost characterize the spot market as 'no bid,' Nokta said on Monday. No matter how much capacity was taken offline, spot freight rates were just not budging. But these GRIs they have just put in look a bit stickier. Zim NYSE: ZIM continues to be the most talked-about stock in my coverage universe, said Nokta, who covers a wide range of shipping equities from tankers to dry bulk to container shipping. With around 90 million in Zim shares bought and sold each day, it is very actively traded, he said. Zim's heavy focus on the Asia-YOU.S. market (mainly to the East Coast) and its high spot exposure make it the go-to name -- it is probably the best way in Western markets to express a view on freight rates. That is one reason why there have been a lot of bets put on it recently. Zim's stock, as with other container shipping stocks, fell hard since the boom-time peak. It is down 70 from its 52-week high. But it closed Monday up 24 from April 6. Nokta said of the liner market in general: It has been so ugly that investors generally think this is as bad as it gets and the bottom we have seen is probably too extreme, because it is destocking of inventories and not reflective of actual demand. And the moment the destock is over you are going to have more activity and that is going to come up against a trans-Pacific market with 20-30 of its capacity removed. Investors are thinking, The industry could have issues over the next two years as new ships deliver, but in the near term, what is going to drive the shares is the end of the destock and beginning of the restock. Shares of container lines like Zim and container-ship lessors like Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL) rose with rate momentum during the boom and fell when rates collapsed from the peak. One of the pitches for container shipping stocks more recently relates to value: that stock prices overshot to the downside and do not reflect the current value of the companies. The value thesis has been easier on the ship-lessor side because there is asset value and there is visibility, said Nokta. For the lessors -- the companies that provide leased tonnage to the liner companies -- both time-charter rates and container-ship asset values have risen off their lows. The Harpex index, which measures global time-charter rates, has been on the upswing since late February. Ship brokerage Braemar reported Monday that the buzz in the container ship chartering market continues and asset prices continue to have some upward momentum ... as charter periods in some sectors noticeably lengthen. According to Nokta, the value pitch on the liner side has been harder because these companies are in a net cash position and they are trading below book value so there is definitely a recognition that they are not expensive, but investors are trying to gauge: How cheap are they? How much should they be pricing in for loss-making periods? One sentiment factor in liner stocks' favor: Liner companies are not behaving in any way like their industry is facing imminent disaster, despite loss-making freight rates and a record-high newbuilding orderbook. From the outside looking in, you would say: They have all paid out monster dividends. They are continuing to order ships. They are time-chartering more vessels. Absent looking at spot rates, you would say everything is fine. But when you look at freight rates, no one is profitable on a mark-to-market basis, so what is happening? I would say liners have a history of being aware of their market's dynamics. They see the trends because they are actually living them minute by minute, Nokta told FreightWaves. They saw what was happening three years ago at the beginning of the COVID boom before a lot of us did. In other words, the liners' current actions may imply that their future prospects are not as dire as today's dismal freight rates suggest. What of the massive orderbook? I would say that a lot of these orders are orders the liners wanted to place four or five years ago but they did not have the cash flow then, said Nokta. The new ships will also be much more cost efficient, he emphasized. I think they are ordering ships in anticipation of replacing their existing portfolio. The liners can lower their unit costs and make the existing fleet more of a shipowners' lessors' problem. Both liners and the container-ship lessors entered this downturn with very strong cash positions and very good balance sheets. As a result, the liners will not have to fight for market share to the degree they did in past downturns, Nokta maintained. Liners typically own around half their fleet and charter the other half. They can take delivery of their newbuildings and let existing charters roll off to the extent necessary, leaving it to the ship lessors to figure out how they are going to redeploy those older vessels.",https://www.freightwaves.com/news/container-shipping-sees-more-signs-of-a-bottom-at-least-for-now,0,"Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) has just risen for the third week in a row after nine months of continuous declines.

The airport in State College, located less than five miles from the campus, was closed to air traffic and passengers while an explosives device team and local police examine the contents of the bag, which was checked on a flight en route to Chicago, Penn State University Police and Public Safety said in a statement. A suspicious looking item was detected by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers in a checked back at the airport, according to TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein. Local police officers and FBI officials are on site, she said. The immediate area was evacuated and a perimeter established. The local police and bomb technicians will be taking a closer look at the bag and its contents, Farbstein said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a ground stop for the airport due to security. As of Friday evening, there was no estimate for when the airport would reopen, police said. The airport closure took place as Penn State students were gearing up for their Spring Break travel plans next week.

There was no pollution and no hazard to shipping or to the public, ccording to the Harris County Office of Emergency Management.

Grossberg, who worked as a senior producer for hosts Maria Bartiromo and Tucker Carlson, alleged in a new sworn statement obtained by NBC News that Fox lawyers ignored repeated reminders about an additional cellphone in her possession and did not search it during court-ordered discovery. In the statement, Grossberg said she repeatedly told Fox lawyers that she had an inoperable company-issued cellphone that she used during 2020 election coverage. Fox lawyers told her to hang on to the device but never searched it or copied her files, as they did with her other phones, according to the statement. Grossberg was fired in March after she filed a lawsuit claiming that Fox lawyers coerced her into giving misleading testimony in the Dominion case and that she was being made a scapegoat for the network's 2020 election coverage. Fox says she was fired for divulging privileged information. Grossberg, in the new affidavit, said a forensic expert recently pulled two recordings off the broken phone that she recorded using an app called Otter, which simultaneously records and creates text transcriptions of audio files. The recordings, which she details in the affidavit and audio of which was shared with NBC News, are of phone interviews she participated in with Bartiromo: one with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and another with two sources who claimed to know about Dominion voter fraud. She said she used Otter in the normal course of her work as a producer. Recordings are saved in the Otter app, and they can also be shared. Grossberg's attorney, Gerry Filippatos, said the statement would be filed with the Delaware court as early as Tuesday, the day the trial is set to begin. Abby Grossberg stands ready to do her part to ensure that justice is done; that those who are licensed and obligated to tell the truth, and guide others to the truth, do just that. As soon as possible and practicable, Ms. Grossberg will continue to set the record straight by telling all she knows to those who need to know, Filippatos said in a statement. In last week's pretrial court appearances, Dominion attorneys played other recordings Grossberg made as a producer, including one with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that Dominion said they would received from Fox just the previous week. That, along with confusion over News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch's current role at Fox News, appeared to frustrate Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis. Murdoch is Fox News' executive chair, too. He admonished the Fox lawyers for withholding evidence and not being straightforward with the court, and he said the company would have to foot the bill if an additional deposition was necessary. He also said he was considering appointing a special master to investigate legal misconduct by the attorneys over whether Fox misrepresented their discovery efforts. Abby Grossberg is not Dominion's problem. It is not my problem. Abby Grossberg is a Fox problem, Davis said at the hearing last week. It may not show, but I am very uncomfortable, he added. Dominion did not respond to requests for comment. FOX News has complied with its discovery obligations, a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. At last week's hearing, Fox lawyer Michael Skokna said Grossberg had not disclosed the existence of the Otter recordings. In her new statement, Grossberg said that Skokna's claim was absolutely false and that she would told Fox lawyers about Otter in August. I proactively and specifically disclosed to the Fox News attorneys that I used an app called Otter for work purposes during the relevant time period, she said, adding that a Fox attorney then asked her to explain how Otter works. In a filing dated Monday, Fox lawyers added that while they had not known of Grossberg's Otter recordings, they had shared some of Grossberg's Otter transcripts found on email. The Giuliani transcript was shared with Dominion 10 months ago, they said. Grossberg said that she recently asked a forensic expert to review the older phone and that the expert uncovered the recordings of the two interviews. Grossberg's attorney shared the audio with NBC News. The first recording, according to Grossberg's affidavit, made on November 7, 2020, was of a phone interview Bartiromo and Grossberg conducted with Cruz to discuss a planned broadcast appearance. Cruz is heard discussing voter fraud allegations -- including an irregularity in Michigan, which uses Dominion machines in most counties -- but stresses the need for facts and proof. It falls on the shoulders of the legal team that is bringing these cases to ascertain the facts. And it just cannot be, you know, someone tweeted this. It is got to be demonstrable facts that can be laid out with evidence, because that is what a court of law is going to look to. Not just an allegation, but actual facts, Cruz said on the recording. And I hope when Rudy comes on the show tomorrow, he has some of those facts. Cruz did not respond to a request for comment. Grossberg said in her affidavit that the second recording, made on November 13, 2020, was of a background interview Grossberg and Bartiromo conducted with a banker named Doug Anderson, the CEO of Wall Street Capital Partners, and a male source who was granted anonymity to participate. The men discuss conspiratorial claims about Dominion voting machines; Bartiromo promises to help expose as much as we can, while Grossberg presses for more information. Anderson did not respond to a request for comment. Grossberg said in the new statement that after she was fired last month, Fox asked her to return her ID badge and her company-issued cellphone. She said she complied but added that she forgot that she still had the older, broken device at the time. Chris Mattei, a lawyer who sued conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation on behalf of families of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, said Dominion's lawyers may well be able to capitalize on the situation. The better thing that Dominion's lawyers might think about is the extent to which they can use any evidence or cover up as affirmative evidence of something like consciousness of guilt, he said, especially if Grossberg testifies for Dominion. Dominion included Grossberg on a list of proposed witnesses filed with the court. Sometimes evidence of a cover-up or bad faith in litigation -- like that evidence itself -- a jury might find pretty compelling, he said. Grossberg has filed to intervene in the Delaware defamation case, but the judge has not yet ruled on the matter.",https://www.nbcnews.com/media/fired-fox-news-producer-says-found-evidence-relevant-dominion-case-rcna80134,0,"Abby Grossberg says she found more evidence relevant to Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit.

Federal regulators began enforcing the mandate on April 1, 2018. Read more from this series here. Industry insiders are accusing some ELD vendors of exploiting flaws in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's technical specifications to let trucking companies and their drivers add ghost co-drivers to skirt hours-of-service rules. Recently, a driver using ELD Rider software recorded a ghost co-driver being added to his device within 15-20 minutes after the driver contacted the company to request more hours. The truck driver requested that FreightWaves not link to the video in the article for fear that his voice or truck may be recognized by ELD Rider representatives. Instead, FreightWaves agreed to use screenshots from the video to illustrate how the ghost co-driver process is done. At the time the YOU.S. driver contacted the ELD Rider representative in Serbia, the driver, who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation, had no drive time left on his clock and only 12 hours remaining on his 70-hour cycle before he was required by federal law to take a 34-hour reset. The video, which was reviewed by FreightWaves, shows an alert being sent to the engine control module (ECM) connected to the driver's truck. The alert notified the driver that a representative was logging him off and taking over to edit his logs. He later received a call from ELD Rider confirming that the representative had edited the log to add a co-driver, often referred to as a ghost driver. The video then pans to his device, showing that he now had almost 10 hours of drive time left and around 68 hours remaining on his cycle before he must take 34 consecutive hours off duty before driving again. As of publication, LionEight LLC is listed on the FMCSA registry as the company that owns the ELD Rider software. On background, counsel representing LionEight TMS LLC, said the new entity is entirely separate from LionEight TMS, and was sold to Darex Solutions last year. The sale included all of LionEight's assets, the ELD software and accounts, the attorney added.  LionEight TMS has nothing to do with these devices. LionEight TMS continues to own the rights to the actual name LionEight. Darex is using the name 'LionEight' under the terms of a temporary license agreement it has with LionEight TMS, the attorney said. All of the businesses are listed to the same address in McCook, Illinois, including the new LionEight TMS entity, according to the Illinois secretary of state's business entity website. The attorney said LionEight TMS, which is launching a new product offering in May, has no involvement with the devices or the conduct that FreightWaves uncovered with the help of industry sources familiar with the use of ghost co-drivers. A whistleblower told FreightWaves that representatives of ELD Rider owned by LionEight have been manipulating drivers' HOS logs to cheat the system since 2019, even it LionEight LLC sold the company to Darex Solutions in December. Fleets using automatic onboard recording device systems (AOBRDS) were forced to switch to ELDs by December 2019. Some vendors developed work-arounds to attract customers who wanted to add ghost co-drivers to cheat on HOS logs. Things really got out of hand in late 2019 when AOBRDS were being phased out, an industry source, who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation, told FreightWaves. In a March 16 email to customers, LionEight LLC announced it would be changing its name to Darex Solutions, effective April 3. All of the charges from former LionEight LLC will now be reflected with the new name Darex Solutions LLC and associated with the same bank account, stated the email, which was obtained by FreightWaves. The email, signed by the Darex Solutions LLC Team, formerly LionEight LLC, stated, Additionally, there has been no change in management and in the range of products and services we offer. A source familiar with the situation independently reviewed the recording of the ELD Rider representative adding a ghost driver. The source says the video was forwarded to federal investigators a few weeks before the ELD provider announced it was changing its name. However, FMCSA did not confirm whether it had reviewed the video or was investigating claims about the ELD Rider HOS app and its alleged ghost co-driver feature. FMCSA does not comment on ongoing investigations or enforcement procedures, the regulatory agency said in an email to FreightWaves. However, each device listedregistered as an ELD must meet the minimum requirements established in 49 CFR part 395, Subpart B, Appendix A. FMCSA has a process to monitor ELD regulatory compliance, and those devices found to not meet these requirements will be removed from the ELD registration list. It appears FMCSA, which regulates the trucking industry, is ramping up enforcement to crack down on ELD providers that do not meet federal requirements. The agency has removed five devices from its registry this year, which is more than it revoked in the previous four years, with only two revocations in 2022. The FMCSA removed All-Ways Track ELD from its self-certification registry on Monday. The vendor has until May 26 to make the necessary changes before it can recertify its device. Until then, the agency is urging All-Ways' ELD customers to use paper logs while the issues are addressed. FMCSA revoked two ELD providers, TMS One's ELD One and its sister company One Plus ELD's 1 PL Logs, from its registry two months ago. Executives at the companies providing these two devices have already self-certified another HOS-tracking app, CN ELD, with FMCSA. After FMCSA revoked ELD One from its registry in January, CEO Radu Murzac acknowledged that his device was not in full compliance with the mandate. A week later, 1 PL Logs, which used the same source code as ELD One, was removed from the list of approved devices. When we first came to market, the process to become an ELD provider was relatively new, Murzac told FreightWaves. We navigated this process with the best interpretation of the law as we could. However, we have come to learn that the interpretation and logic we based a few components of our platform on was not in full compliance of the mandate. Sources familiar with ELD One and 1 PL Logs allege customers were able to use a ghost co-driver option. Murzac acknowledges that he has a team of people overseas providing customer support and monitoring services. He said there are many third-party services in the industry that he has nothing to do with that offer ghost driver services. He also said he is aware that some ELD providers cheat the system. Most, if not all, ELDs are probably subject to such manipulations, Murzac said in an email to FreightWaves. According to Illinois secretary of state business filings, a new company called ELD Connection Inc. is owned by Murzac's partner, Karina Hryhoruk. A source familiar with the new company said ELD Connection is currently moving customers over to the new CN ELD platform. In September, the FMCSA began seeking comments from the public on possible revisions to improve regulations governing the use of ELDs and to address concerns about technical specifications that have been raised by compliant ELD providers. This is good news for some ELD providers that have taken it upon themselves to police the industry. Industry insiders and safety groups are critical of FMCSA's decision to allow ELD providers to self-certify their devices instead of adopting Canada's mandate that requires independent third-party testers to vet the companies to ensure their software meets Canadian's technical requirements, which may make them less susceptible to manipulation. Independent third-party testing was not an option in the YOU.S., according to Duane DeBruyne, who served as the FMCSA's spokesman from 2005 to 2021, because Congress did not provide dedicated funding to cover the costs. FMCSA followed the model established by its sister USDOT agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has long made use of self-certification in the myriad of vehicle components it regulates, DeBruyne wrote in an email to FreightWaves. After 16 years, DeBruyne retired as FMCSA's spokesman in early January 2022. He said he is unable to authoritatively comment on the happenings over the past 15 months about why the agency failed to investigate alleged cheating by some ELD providers to skirt HOS regulations. However, he agrees that the regulatory agency appears to be ramping up enforcement to revoke fraudulent ELDs By the end of December 2021, with the number of ELD manufacturers having grown exponentially, FMCSA program staff did begin looking into possible illegal products, DeBruyne said. However, for the period covering the previous 45 months, 'self-certification' of ELDs was a 'non-issue' within the agency, he said. One source described the actions of vendors that take advantage of flaws in FMCSA's self-certification process as the untraceable, perfect crime that is taking place on the federal level at the hands of FMCSA-registered ELD providers. Numerous laws of the federal government of the United States are being broken every day, every hour and every minute by thousands of people, the unnamed source told FreightWaves. The FMCSA's goal of increasing safety on the road and in the work environment will not be achieved if some ELD providers continue to flout the law, the source said. Illegal ELD providers and the trucking companies that use their products are putting the lives and well-being of millions in grave danger, the industry source told FreightWaves.

A bomb cyclone is wreaking havoc across an already soaked California, killing at least two people whose vehicles were crushed by falling trees in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said. A dramatic drop in atmospheric pressure triggered the so-called bomb cyclone that swept in from the Pacific Ocean and clobbered the San Francisco area. The storm packed heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 90 mph that knocked down trees, blocking major roadways and highways, officials said. Tens of thousands of utility customers lost power, according to officials. One person was killed and another was injured in the gated community of Rossmoor, about 25 miles east of San Francisco, when a tree fell on a moving car, according to the California Highway Patrol. Another motorist was killed around 1:30 p.m. local time Tuesday when a toppled tree crushed a work van in San Mateo County, about 30 miles south of San Francisco, according to CHP. The powerful springtime storm is also being blamed for the derailment of an Amtrak train near Martinez, about 35 miles east of San Francisco. The train was carrying 55 passengers when it struck a downed tree on the tracks, according to Amtrak officials. No injuries were reported. High wind gusts also caused a tractor-trailer rig to overturn on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, blocking the eastbound lanes and snarling traffic during the evening commute, according to CHP. The winds were so strong in downtown San Francisco Tuesday that it knocked out windows in high-rise buildings, sending shattered glass to the ground, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. San Francisco International Airport recorded wind gusts of 64 mph, while gusty winds reached 74 mph in Oakland. Gusts hit nearly 90 mph between San Francisco and Sacramento. The bomb cyclone developed off the coast of San Francisco Tuesday when the atmospheric pressure dropped 24 millibars in 17 hours, producing the strongest March storm ever recorded in the Bay Area. The same storm system walloped Southern California Tuesday with wind gusts of up to 100 mph in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles. The town of Lytle Creek in the San Gabriel Mountains recorded more than 6 inches of rain, while nearly an inch-and-a-half of rain fell in downtown Los Angeles. The weather system is expected to weaken Wednesday, but most of California will remain under a flood watch and high-wind alerts are expected to persist into the afternoon. The storm, the latest in a series of atmospheric river systems that has nearly eliminated the state's multi-year drought, is expected to move southeast, bringing severe weather to parts of Texas, Alabama and Oklahoma. Severe weather on Thursday and Friday could produce large hail and damaging winds from the Dallas-Fort Worth area to San Angelo, more than 250 miles southwest of Dallas. As the storm moves east on Friday, a possible tornado outbreak could form in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service.",https://abcnews.go.com/US/bomb-cyclone-wreaks-havoc-california-killing-2/story?id=98038157,1,"A dramatic drop in atmospheric pressure triggered the so-called bomb cyclone.

Following the buzzy release of Netflix's hit comedy drama Beef, one of its stars, David Choe, has drawn controversy for an incident he talked about on a podcast he was hosting in 2014. Clips of the podcast, which feature him telling a story that has been criticized as rape and sexual assault -- but that he later walked back as a fabrication on his part -- have been widely shared since Beef debuted last week. During his now-defunct podcast, DVDASA, Choe said that he performed sex acts in front of a massage therapist named Rose and forced her to do so as well after she had said no, among other instances that he labeled as rapey behavior. Choe, who plays Isaac on the Netflix show and is also known for his graffiti artistry, said during the podcast episode, viewed by NBC News, So I go back to the chill method of: You never ask first, you just do it, get in trouble and then pay the price later. Neither Choe nor Netflix responded to NBC News' request for comment. But following the controversial podcast in 2014, the artist released a statement, denying any truth to the story, saying the podcast is a complete extension of my art. I never thought I would wake up one late afternoon and hear myself called a rapist. It sucks. Especially because I am not one. I am not a rapist. I hate rapists, he wrote in the 2014 statement. Multiple news outlets reported on his response at the time, which was posted on the podcast's now-defunct website. He described the mission of the podcast at the time as, We create stories and tell tales ... It is my version of reality, it is art that sometimes offends people. I am sorry if anyone believed that the stories were fact. They were not! Many social media users are questioning his casting and pointing to specific quotes in the past clips, such as Choe saying that he is a successful rapist. At the time, the comments prompted criticisms from activists and organizations including Advancing Justice -- LA, Center for the Pacific Asian Family, and South Asian Helpline and Referral Agency, who deemed what Choe had described an instance of coercion and an example of sexual violence. Choe's story reflects the harsh reality that men and women alike continue to believe and perpetuate the dangerous myth that coerced sexual activity is not considered assault or rape. By legal definition, you are committing an act of sexual assault when you do not receive consent, the organizations wrote in a statement. Based on Choe's telling, the masseuse's repeated protests, in addition to his physical coercion, indicate that she was not consenting to the acts he requested. While Choe addressed the incident after the podcast's release, the issue came up again in 2017 after a mural he painted was vandalized. Among the messages tagged on it was the word rapist. Choe released a statement on Instagram following the incident, apologizing for the episode and writing that he has ZERO history of sexual assault. In a 2014 episode of DVDASA, I relayed a story simply for shock value that made it seem as if I had sexually violated a woman. Though I said those words, I did not commit those actions. It did not happen, he said. I am deeply sorry for any hurt I have brought to anyone through my past words. Non-consensual sex is rape and it is never funny or appropriate to joke about.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/beef-star-david-choe-slammed-podcast-detailing-rapey-behavior-resurfac-rcna79809,0,"David Choe, one of the stars of Netflix's Beef, has drawn controversy for an incident he talked about on a podcast he was hosting in 2014.

Since June 2022, national rail strikes in a tangle of disputes about pay, job security and working arrangements have caused problems for tens of millions of train passengers. Since then, stoppages causing massive disruption for passengers have been called frequently. These are the key questions and answers. The main rail union, the RMT, has instructed all its members working for Network Rail and 14 train operators to strike on Thursday 16 March. In addition, those working for train operators will also walk out on Saturday 18 March, Thursday 30 March and Saturday 1 April. The train firms are those contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators: All the London commuter operators will also be hit: Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected: On 16 March the national strike includes workers at both Network Rail and the train operators. The intention is to knock out most services across Great Britain. Crucially, signalling staff working for Network Rail will walk out, reducing the nation's railway to a rump of some intercity lines and commuter routes. There will also be some effect on the evening of Wednesday 15 March and the morning of Friday 17 March. Thousands of trains will run, but they are likely to be limited to between 7.30am and 6.30pm because of signalling cover. The exact proportion of normal services will vary sharply from one train operator to another. Figures published by the government for the last similar strike, on 4 January, show that Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway and LNER operated between a quarter and a third of usual services. On most commuter services in the London area, the figure was around one in five. Worst performer was Northern, which operated only one in 20 of regular scheduled trains. Among train firms that are not in dispute with the RMT, the proportion of services also varies widely. In Scotland and Wales, where the national operators - ScotRail and Transport for Wales - are not involved, most trains will be cancelled. In Scotland, 19 per cent of scheduled services ran last time, while the figure for Wales was 14 per cent. Grand Central, linking London King's Cross with Yorkshire and Teesside, ran 58 per cent of its planned trains. Heathrow Express did best, with two out of three services running normally on 4 January. A similar performance is expected for 16 March. The strikes on 18 and 30 March plus 1 April will have significantly less impact, as signallers should work normally. Train operators not involved in the dispute should be able to run services as scheduled. On all but the first day of the next round of strikes - 16 March - passengers can expect normal service on: Trains run by these companies are likely to be more crowded than normal on routes usually shared with train operators whose staff are striking, such as London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh and Swansea-Cardiff-Newport. The effects of the Network Rail overtime ban are less easy to quantify. On Thursday 16 March early and late trains linking London with Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam are likely to be curtailed because of the strike by Network Rail signallers. On the remaining three days there should be no impact - but connections to and from London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three train operators (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) will walk out. Workers for both Network Rail and the train operators have been offered a minimum pay rise of 5 per cent for 2022 and 4 per cent for this year (with additional increases for lower-paid staff). But these are contingent on the union accepting a wide range of changes to working arrangements. They have been described as the best and final offers. The RMT is demanding an unconditional pay offer, a job security agreement and no detrimental changes being imposed on members terms, conditions and working practices. The union also describes Network Rail's plans for maintenance as unsafe, unhealthy for our members and unworkable. The general secretary, Mick Lynch, said that after an in-depth consultation of our 40,000 members the overwhelming view was reject these dreadful offers. He said: Our members cannot accept the ripping up of their terms and conditions or to have safety standards on the railway put into jeopardy under the guise of so-called modernisation. If our union did accept these offers, we would see a severe reduction in scheduled maintenance tasks, making the railways less safe, the closure of all ticket offices and thousands of jobs stripped out of the industry when the railways need more investment not less. Our industrial campaign will continue for as long as it takes to get a negotiated settlement that meets our members' reasonable expectations on jobs, pay and working conditions. They are furious that union members were not given the opportunity to vote on the offers and that the RMT is now demanding an unconditional pay rise. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), representing train operators, said: The RMT agreed from the outset that the industry needed modernisation and understood that was how a pay rise could be funded. The leadership have now reneged on that position and say they not accept any reforms. They know that no employer who has lost 20 per cent of its revenue could accept those terms. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's chief negotiator, said: Instead of offering members a democratic vote with a referendum, the RMT leadership is hiding behind a sham 'consultation'. Further strikes will disrupt passengers and cost employees money - while changing nothing as our package of very modest reforms continues. The RMT is well aware of the precarious position of the railway's finances, with no more money to offer more. Network Rail also flatly rejects the assertion that reforms will increase risk, and says in fact they should make passengers and staff safer. It looks unlikely. The government, which will ultimately sanction and pay for the eventual settlement, and the union now appear to have dug in for a war of attrition. The government knows public confidence is being eroded by the unreliability of trains. But the transport secretary, Mark Harper, says: Modernising working practices must be part of reform. On the current offers to members working for Network Rail and the train operators, he says: Best and final means what it says. The railway, he says, is financially unsustainable. Ministers believe cracks are appearing in the solidarity of the union. The RMT leadership, mean, is betting that it can get a no-strings deal - though rail workers are unlikely to recoup the money they have lost during industrial action in the form of higher pay. It is now a question of who backs down first. Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Far from it. Train drivers belonging to the Aslef union staging their eighth walk-out earlier this month in a similar dispute about pay. They, too, are demanding a no-strings offer. Members of Aslef working for London Underground are striking on 15 March, the day before the first RMT strike, in a bid to bring the Tube system to a halt in a separate dispute over changes to working arrangements and pensions.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/train-strikes-dates-everything-know-130241721.html,0,"Network Rail and 14 train operators to strike on Thursday 16 March.

Many hospitals in England have already postponed outpatient appointments or non-urgent operations ahead of the stoppage on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The walkout by 61,000 junior doctors will have a bigger impact than any of the strikes held since December by nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists, NHS England said. The action is expected to see some of the most severe strike disruption of NHS services to date and have a huge impact on the drive to reduce waiting lists for elective care, it said. The British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' union, has designed this first of a threatened series of strikes by junior doctors over pay to be as impactful as possible, as a warning shot to ministers. It is seeking full pay restoration of the 26.2 fall in the real-terms value of trainee doctors' pay it calculates they have experienced since 200809. Newly qualified doctors start their careers in the NHS earning just 14 an hour, the co-chairs of the BMA's junior doctors committee told Rishi Sunak in a letter last Wednesday. Campaigning junior doctors have been highlighting on social media that some baristas earn the same or more. On Friday night Steve Barclay said he has written to junior doctors in the BMA inviting them to enter into pay talks after negotiations with other health unions. The health secretary tweeted that he had contacted the trade union asking it to enter into formal discussions about pay, urging it to call off planned strikes. I have written to BMAJuniorDocs inviting them for formal pay talks on the same basis other health unions accepted, including calling off next week's strike, he said. Let us have a constructive dialogue to make the NHS a better place to work and ensure we deliver the care patients need. The union responded that Barclay had not attended pay talks on Friday. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's medical director, said the service had been working very hard to try to mitigate the impact of the 72-hour walkout. But, he added: While we are doing what we can to avoid having to reschedule appointments, there is no doubt that disruption will be much more severe than before and patients who have been waiting for some time will face postponements across many treatment areas. During the strike, hospitals will use consultants to ensure that they continue to provide services involving potentially life-or-death care - such as AE, critical care, maternity services and long waits for operations, including cancer surgery - as close to normally as possible. Meanwhile, NHS bosses have warned Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, that it will remain stuck in perpetual crisis management unless he agrees to fund a massive expansion of homegrown doctors and nurses. The NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts, has written to Hunt asking him to rebut reports this week that the Treasury is seeking to water down targets in the forthcoming and long-awaited NHS workforce strategy. The plan had aimed to train much larger numbers of health professionals to tackle the massive staff shortage facing the service, which has 124,000 vacancies. As the chair of the Commons health select committee last year, Hunt - who was health secretary for six years - argued strongly for the Treasury to commit to publishing regular independent assessments of the number of staff the NHS needs and to expand training places to provide more recruits. One senior NHS source said that, now he is chancellor, Hunt is arguing that the government should not agree to such commitments, which would cost billions of pounds a year to fulfil. He seems to think that any financial headroom he has should be used to pave the way for the Conservatives to offer tax cuts before the next election, and not to train more doctors, nurses and other NHS staff, which is different to what he said before, said the official. The confederation warns Hunt in its letter, which it has shared with the Guardian, that a failure to agree to binding targets for increased numbers of health professionals will see the NHS continue to be understaffed, with all of the implications that brings for patient care, waiting times, the efficiency of services and for staff morale.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/11/junior-doctors-strike-will-have-unprecedented-impact-on-nhs-says-top-medic,0,"Walkout will cause even more disruption than recent action by nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists.

The vessel Nautica, which is expected to arrive in Yemen in early May, was purchased by the UNDP from Belgian shipping company Euronav in March to remove more than a million barrels of oil from the deteriorating Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) Safer vessel. An employee of Euronav confirmed to Xinhua on Thursday that Nautica left the drydock in Zhoushan on Wednesday after receiving maintenance and necessary modifications over the past weeks. The FSO Safer, anchored off the coast of Yemen's Red Sea port of Hodeidah, has not been maintained since 2015 due to the conflict in Yemen, Xinhua news agency reported. The decaying and dilapidated supertanker has been referred to as a floating time-bomb that poses a risk of explosion or oil spill, potentially four times as disastrous as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez incident in the Red Sea, according to the UN's repeated warnings. The UNDP statement warned that a major spill would devastate fishing communities along Yemen's Red Sea coast, resulting in the loss of 2,00,000 livelihoods overnight, with fish stocks taking 25 years to recover. It would also lead to the closure of the essential ports of Hodeidah and Saleef, which are crucial for bringing food, fuel, and life-saving supplies into Yemen where 17 million people are in need of food assistance, as stated by the UNDP. The departure of the Nautica, and its onward journey to the Red Sea, is a significant next step in the complex operation to take on the oil from the Safer, quoted UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner in the statement. The UN said it had received firm commitments for 95 million for the FSO Safer rescue plan, adding it still needs another 34 million to continue the project.

(AP) -- A threat aboard a United Airlines aircraft prompted a massive emergency response that shut down Vermont's international airport for about three hours before authorities determined the plane to be safe. The threat was made Sunday afternoon on a flight en route from Newark, New Jersey, to the Burlington International Airport, Burlington police said. After landing, the plane was taken to a separate area on the tarmac. Authorities searched the plane and its 65 passengers with bomb-sniffing dogs, one of the passengers, State Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, told WCAX-TV. The passengers were able to deplane after sitting on the tarmac for almost two hours, Baruth said. Video from WCAX showed emergency personnel lining up the baggage on the ground in front of the aircraft before searching each piece. Baruth said the passengers were taken into a hangar. They isolated us with police at both ends and they do not know whether one of us could be a bad actor, so that does not feel great, he said. The airport was closed for about three hours and no incoming flights were canceled, said Burlington International Airport Director of Aviation Nicolas Longo. He said that by Monday, most passengers had been reunited with their luggage. He said the airplane's crew was able to rest overnight and depart on their regular schedule Monday morning. Longo would not discuss the details of the investigation. He said the FBI was in charge. Authorities did not release details on the nature of the threat, which MyNBC5 reported was found in a bathroom of the aircraft. The station said the pilot then notified air traffic control. Law enforcement authorities found no credible threat on the aircraft. What we have here is a safe group of people. We have a safe plane. We have a safe airport, said Jon Murad, acting chief of the Burlington Police Department. Longo said the airport staff had trained for emergencies and he was pleased by the response.

In an early sign of the disruption, Romania's foreign minister, unable to board a cancelled flight, will be forced to fly to Austria and then make the more than four-hour drive to Munich, a Romanian embassy official said. It is the latest in a series of strikes and protests that have hit major European economies, including France, Britain and Spain, as higher food and energy prices knocked incomes and living standards following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. About 295,000 passengers are affected by the cancellation of 2,340 flights at Bremen, Dortmund, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Stuttgart airports, according to the ADV airports association. We really have not had such an escalation through strike action, ADV's Ralph Beisel told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. German trade union Verdi announced the strike on Wednesday after it said collective bargaining efforts for ground service staff, public sector officials and aviation security workers had made little progress. The union has pressed for a 10.5 per cent wage increase, or at least 500 euros a month. If nothing is done about pay now, we will all be in for another chaotic summer, Verdi deputy chair Christine Behle told Inforadio on Friday. It is about sending a really strong signal. Among the airlines affected, Lufthansa said it had been forced to cancel more than 1,300 flights and suspend operations at the hub airports Frankfurt and Munich on Friday. The carrier declined to give an estimate of the cost of the strike, but has on previous occasions said such action costs it 10 to 15 million euros (15.5 to 23.4 million) a day. The head of Verdi, Frank Werneke, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper that strike action could expand to hospitals and garbage collection.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-18/airport-workers-strike-germany-passengers-grounded-munich/101993030,1,"24-hour strike at seven German airports set to affect nearly 300,000 passengers.

The village in Dadu district, about 380km (235 miles) from Pakistan's largest city Karachi, was one of the worst affected by last year's catastrophic floods, caused by melting glaciers and record monsoons - both induced by climate change. The floods affected 33 million people, destroyed 2.2 million homes and killed more than 1,700 people. For Haleema Aslam, the floodwaters brought distress and misery as they washed away her mature crops and livestock along with her dreams. Indebted to a local landlord for years, the 45-year-old lost her livelihood in the disaster. Before floods I worked in the agricultural fields from dawn to dusk to raise my five children and raise my livestock to make ends meet. Now there is no land for cultivation and all my livestock - over a dozen goats, four buffaloes and three cows - drowned, Aslam told Al Jazeera. Seven months after the deluge, Aslam still feels the trauma of the August night, followed by days of walking after she was compelled to leave her house. She is among 7.2 million female agricultural workers in Pakistan now exposed to extreme weather events, according to a 2018 report (PDF) by the United Nations. Living in the tents was difficult for me and my family. There were attacks of snakes and other reptiles, especially at night. So we moved back to our house after two months even though our house was submerged. But when we returned, it rained again and drowned our house, forcing us to migrate again, said Aslam. Women forced to stay in open-air tents for extended periods due to natural disasters have faced challenges related to privacy and societal norms, with Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman calling the unprecedented floods the worst humanitarian disaster of this decade. Despite donors pledging 9bn of flood aid to Pakistan, Aslam has not received a cent to rebuild her house. The International Labour Organization (ILO) says disruptions and job losses due to floods affected about 4.3 million workers in Pakistan. According to the ILO data, the percentage of female employment in the agriculture sector is 65 percent, making it the country's biggest employer which contributes 23 percent to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). But women are often denied labour rights and protections, employed without written contracts, and mostly get lower wages than men. Moreover, with Pakistan being one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the agriculture sector remains particularly exposed to extreme weather conditions and their aftermath. Seema Chandio, 43, is another resident of Dital Khan Chandio village whose house and 15 acres (six hectares) of land owned by her family were submerged for three months. Water stood up to seven feet in our house - well above my height. It took nearly three months to recede and we lived like nomads, she told Al Jazeera. When Chandio returned to her village, her house had completely vanished. We had bought seeds, fertilisers and pesticides from the market. All our rice and cotton crops were destroyed, resulting in a huge loss. We purchased the seeds, fertilisers and pesticides again for the next wheat crop, but we were unable to sow on time due to the presence of water that had not receded until January, she said, as she worked on rebuilding her house. Since the floods, my family is under a debt of 300,000 rupees (1,060). This amount does not account for the potential profits that could have been earned from the two crop seasons we lost, she added. Although the floodwaters have receded in most of the affected areas, 1.8 million people still live near dirty and stagnant water, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), leading to a loss of agricultural livelihoods for women for two consecutive crop seasons. My family's bread and butter revolves around farming in which every member takes part. After losing the paddy crop completely, we could only cultivate wheat as water was still standing. It will hurt us the whole year as we would not be able to feed our family without any relief from the government, Chandio said. Labour and gender rights activists say last year's floods that destroyed two consecutive crops resulted in a significant amount of debt for peasants, including women. When monsoons arrived, the standing crops of cotton and rice were washed away. As water did not recede in subsequent months, the upcoming wheat season was also severely affected. The situation has led to losses instead of profits from these back-to-back crop losses. Consequently, women farmers who were unable to work on their farms for six months or more are now burdened with debts, Akram Khaskheli, a farmer, human rights activist and president of a charity group told Al Jazeera. Azra Ameer still lives in a tent. She lost most of her cattle in the floods, leaving her with no means of income to support her family. With her husband sick and bedridden, she faces an uncertain future and an uphill battle to rebuild her life. The flood-related trauma we have faced in multiple forms will haunt us for a lifetime. It has shattered our lives, the 30-year-old livestock worker told Al Jazeera. Experts say that while developed countries set up a loss and damage fund at the 2022 COP27 climate change conference, it does not account for the losses suffered by vulnerable countries such as Pakistan. Any climate fund needs to be proportional to the damage that has been caused by the biggest emitters, and it should be mandatory for the biggest polluters to pledge a portion of their annual budget towards paying reparations and there should be a mechanism to enforce these payments, Osama Malik, an environmental lawyer, told Al Jazeera. However, Malik added that in Pakistan, where financial transparency is dismal, there should also be a mechanism to ensure that money from the loss and damage fund should be utilised properly on flood victims such as female labourers and should not wasted inefficiently or embezzled. In the past, we have seen that whenever a disaster has struck Pakistan, whether in the form of earthquake, floods or even COVID-19 pandemic, much of the funds or aid that came from abroad were utilised by the military without much oversight, resulting in further weakening of civilian institutions. It is hoped that any climate reparation funds will not be utilised in a similar fashion, Malik said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/31/pakistans-female-agriculture-workers-suffering-since-2022-floods,0,"Haleema Aslam is among 7.2 million female agricultural workers in Pakistan exposed to extreme weather events.

Kerry O'Brien, Frank O'Brien, and William Gross reportedly left April 4, and intended to make a provisions stop in Cabo San Lucas, roughly 200 nautical miles across the Sea of Cortez, on April 6 before heading to San Diego, the YOU.S. Coast Guard said. However, there was no record of them arriving in Cabo San Lucas or a report in of their location, the Coast Guard said in a statement Friday. Gross' daughter, Melissa Spicuzza, said the O'Briens invited her father to sail with them and he jumped at the chance because he loves being on the water, according to NBC San Diego. She said her father lives on a boat on San Diego Bay. Each missing American, Spicuzza said, has decades of sailing experience, and the O'Briens have Coast Guard captain's licenses, required for voyages with paying passengers. I am just wanting my dad, my dad and the O'Briens, to roll back in and say, 'What is going on guys?' she told the station. The Mexican Navy was leading the search for the three, and the Coast Guard was helping, the YOU.S. military branch said. Searchers have contacted marinas in Baja, Mexico, but no one has reported seeing the trio's boat, a LaFitte model 44 sailing yacht, the Coast Guard said. Urgent marine broadcasts via VHF radio have so far turned up no reports of the sailors or the 44-foot vessel, the Ocean Bound, it said. The model was sold in the 1970s and 1980s by LaFitte Yachts Inc. of Newport Beach. The company said it was conceived by noted yacht designer Robert Perry as the ultimate cruising yacht hull, according to marketing material from the time.

A small group of protesters hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and hand grenades, before dispersing to nearby streets. At least 57 people were killed and dozens were injured on Tuesday when a passenger train with more than 350 people on board collided with a freight train on the same track in central Greece. After protests over the past three days across the country, some 10,000 students, railway workers and groups affiliated with left-wing parties gathered in an Athens square on Sunday to express sympathy for the lives lost and to demand better safety standards on the rail network. That crime will not be forgotten, protesters shouted as they released black balloons into the sky. A placard read: Their policies cost human lives. The train, travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki, was packed with university students returning after a long holiday weekend. The disaster has triggered an outpouring of anger, as well as a sharp focus on safety standards. Railway workers, who also lost colleagues in the accident, have staged rotating walkouts since Wednesday to denounce cost-cutting and underinvestment in the rail infrastructure, a legacy of Greece's debilitating debt crisis from 2010 to 2018. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's government has blamed human error for the crash. However, Mitsotakis said on Sunday that human error should not deflect from responsibilities for a long-suffering railway network. As prime minister, I owe everyone, but most of all the relatives of the victims, an apology, he wrote on Facebook. Justice will very fast investigate the tragedy and determine liabilities. A station master in the nearby city of Larissa who was on duty at the time of the crash was charged this week with endangering lives and disrupting public transport.

A consultative ballot of almost 35,000 consultants conducted by the union found that 86 pr cent would be prepared to take part in strike action, raising the prospect of severe disruption to NHS services. The BMA said that while a consultative ballot does not provide a legal mandate for strike action, the poll represents the strength of anger among England's senior doctors and it will move to a statutory ballot in April. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA consultants committee, said: In my 25 years in the NHS, I have never seen consultants more demoralised, frustrated and in despair over this Government's refusal to support the NHS workforce and the patients they serve. The Government is refusing to listen to consultants' concerns, driving many out of the NHS entirely. If the Government truly wants to get the NHS back on track and tackle the record waiting lists, it must support the consultant workforce. Our position is clear - we will not allow the Government to continue to degrade consultants' pay and pensions. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: If this is the strength of feeling from consultants now, the worry is that some could be less inclined to cover shifts during the upcoming junior doctors strikes next week, leaving patient care at increased risk. While it is positive that the other trade unions have agreed to suspend their planned industrial action to enter negotiations with the government, it is important for all parts of the NHS's workforce to have the same opportunity to have their concerns around pay understood. The danger of not doing this is that the war of attrition between both sides will continue and escalate further, which no one wants. Meanwhile, junior doctor members of the BMA will strike for 72 hours from March 13 in a bitter dispute over pay and conditions. But industrial action by paramedics, nurses and physiotherapists has been suspended as union officials enter intensive talks with Health Secretary Steve Barclay over pay. Mr Barclay had previously infuriated unions by exclusively opening talks with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), but the Government last week invited health unions to formal pay talks through the NHS staff council, which traditionally sets NHS pay. Pay for RCN members is covered by the NHS-wide Agenda for Change agreement, which also includes other NHS workers. NHS Providers' chief executive Sir Julian Hartley said: This move by consultants is another worrying development for NHS trust leaders, on top of the looming three-day strike by junior doctors. Strikes by consultants would heap yet more pressure on overstretched services. Patient safety and care is the top priority. Trust leaders urge the government and the BMA to find a resolution quickly.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/nhs-consultants-strike-action-bma-b1065023.html,0,"BMA said tens of thousands of senior hospital doctors would vote on potential industrial action on April 17.

Maura T. Healey's proposed state budget -- would be an east-west rail park-and-ride stop for the region, boosters say. It is a Palmer stop, said Ben Hood, chair of the Palmer Station Steering Committee. But it is also a UMass stop. It is an east side of Springfield stop. We expect people from Sixteen Acres to come here. The budget item is the first official acknowledgement that east-west rail would have a stop in Palmer. East-west rail is the planned implementation of fast and frequent train service from Boston to Springfield, Pittsfield and possibly as far west as Albany, N.Y. Today, only the Chicago-bound Lake Shore Limited makes the east-west trip once a day and it does not stop in Palmer. Hood's wife, Anne Miller, co-founder of the group Citizens for a Palmer Rail Stop, said the station could draw Boston- or Albany-bound passengers from as far south as Stafford Springs, Connecticut. And the center of the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus is just 20 minutes away with The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority eager to run shuttle buses from a Palmer rail station to the Haigis Mall at UMass. Hood said: A UMass student will have the choice of going to Northampton to get on the Valley Flyer to Springfield or going to Palmer to get a train to Boston. The town of Palmer is also preparing a request for proposals seeking consultants to that study and design work, Hood said. Palmer touts itself as the town of seven railroads and is still a hub for east-west and north-south freight traffic. But it has not had passenger service since 1971, shortly after the old Penn Central went bankrupt. When Amtrak took over, it eliminated the stop. Hood said the stop would be near the town's historic train depot, now the Steaming Tender restaurant, an H.H. Richardson design built in 1883. But Miller said anew station would be built to modern Amtrak standards with a longer platform raised to allow wheelchair access. It would have a small building for restrooms and cleaning equipment but plenty of parking. The cost of a Palmer station, per the capital costs appendix of the East-West Rail Passenger Study in January 2021, was 12.4 million. The east-west project money is coming from revenues created from the Fair Share Amendment, Miller said. Healey included 4 million for the study and design of a Palmer station as well as 8.5 million for track improvements in Pittsfield in her proposed budget released Wednesday. YOU.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield, said the budget proposal demonstrates Healey's commitment to the east-west rail project he is backing, and has backed, on the federal level. It is a commitment she related when she was my guest at the State of the Union and it is a commitment she reiterated the next day when she met with the delegation, said Neal, dean of the state's congressional delegation. I think the biggest task before us now is track improvements, Neal said Thursday. Once we do that, everything else will fall into place. State Rep. William Smitty Pignatelli, D-Lenox, said the Pittsfield work would create a side track, allowing passenger trains stopped at the Pittsfield station to get serviced, replenished or to wait overnight for another run to get off CSX's main east-west rail line and out of the way. To me, it shows that she is committed to making the kind of investments we need in Pittsfield and Palmer to kick this thing off, he said. The budget is also an official acknowledgement that east-west rail will extend to Pittsfield, or possibly as far west as Albany as Amtrak would like. Amtrak, which would run east-west rail trains and sell the tickets, wants to link busy stations on Boston and Albany-Rensselaer and has identified improvements it wants to see on a route which is owned by freight railway CSX. Three cheers for Gov. Healey and Lt. Gov. (Kim) Driscoll, said state Rep. Todd M. Smola, R-Warren, whose district includes Palmer. Very early on they have seen the value of a project we have been working on for some time. Smola said the budget still has to go to the state House of Representatives and the State Senate. But, as ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, he will be part of the conference committee that will have final say. The state legislature last year set up an east-west rail commission charged with hearing public input, with coming up with a governance system and applying for federal funds. But the commission has only had two of its six required meetings and its report is due March 31. Smola said the supplementary budget now winding its way through Beacon Hill would extend the deadline for that state commission. Pignatelli said he is worried that the commission is losing focus. It is up to commission members to keep their foot on the pedal. We cannot let any delays happen, he said. In December, the state Department of Transportation and rail companies Amtrak and CSX Corp. applied this week for 108 million in federal transportation money to help fund improvements along the 53 miles of railroad between Springfield and Worcester. It is through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program. In June, Springfield Union Station received 1.75 million from the CRISI program for track upgrades including additional platforms, additional crossover tracks, storage tracks, a new layover facility, Neal said he expects to hear word on the 108 million CRISSI grant at about the end of this month. Meanwhile, the federal commitment to the project remains strong. The president is very excited about the infrastructure program, Neal said. I was just with the president (Wednesday night) in Baltimore where he spoke very enthusiastically about the infrastructure law. Speaking with the YOU.S. House Democratic Conference, President Joe Biden cited a rail project in Baltimore, especially the rebuilding of a 100-year-old rail tunnel. It is going to change transportation not only on the Northeast Corridor. But instead of 30 miles an hour, it is going through there at 100 miles an hour. And it is a 4 billion investment. And guess what? We are going to let everybody know you did it. These are the signs we are going to put up, Biden said. We are renaming it the Frederick Douglass Tunnel.",https://www.masslive.com/news/2023/03/palmer-pittsfield-rail-money-in-state-budget-demonstrates-healeys-commitment-to-east-west-rail.html,0,"The Palmer rail stop could get a 4 million boost under Gov.

A tropical cyclone is forecast to be the most powerful storm to hit Australia in eight years, bringing extraordinary wind speeds that could take some Western Australia residents by surprise. Tropical Storm Ilsa will cross the northwest Pilbara coast, where cyclones are common. It is expected to make landfall between the iron ore export town of Port Hedland and the Wallal Downs Station cattle ranch. The storm is projected to bring wind gusts of up to 196 miles per hour, according to meteorologists. The category 5 cyclone strengthened over the Indian Ocean on Thursday and was expected to maintained that destructive level early Friday, per the Australia Bureau of Meteorology. FORT LAUDERDALE FLOODING FORCES AIRPORT TO CLOSE, LEAVES DRIVERS STRANDED FOR HOURS Category 5 cyclones have mean wind speeds exceeding 124 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 174 miles per hour. The last category 5 storm in Australia was Cyclone Marcia in 2015. That storm caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in Queensland. The Category 5 Cyclone Veronica did not cross the Pilbara cost in March 2019, but damaged infrastructure and disrupted the region's mining and offshore gas industry. Ahead of this cyclone, police have closed the highway along the Pilbara coast, and officials expect that the North West Coastal Highway will be impassable due to flooding. WEATHER OFFICIALS RETIRING NAMES FIONA, IAN FROM LIST OF TROPICAL CYCLONE NAMES Many in Ilsa's path have evacuated the area, including ranchers, miners, indigenous locals and tourists.

THE GOVERNMENT WILL be asked to approve plans to appoint the Dublin Airport Authority (daa) as the operator of counter-drone technology at Dublin Airport. Flight activity at the Airport was briefly suspended last Thursday due to drone activity, the sixth such disruption in as many weeks. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan came in for scathing criticism from Ryanair's Michael O'Leary last week, when the airline boss said that anti-drone technology is a reasonably easy solution that would only cost around 100,000. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan and Junior Minister Jack Chambers will today ask Cabinet to task daa with purchasing counter drone technology. Ministers will also be asked to consider plans to conduct a wider examination of the need of counter drone technology to protect key state infrastructure such as other airports, energy generation and transmission facilities, defence forces facilities, Government buildings and water infrastructure. It is understood an existing state agency will be tasked with leading this work. Following the decision today, there will be a short period where training is undertaken and the technology is delivered to Dublin Airport. No primary legislation is required to enable its use at the airport, it is believed. Operations at Dublin Airport have been suspended on six separate occasions since late January, resulting in safety risks to aviation, diverted and delayed flights and severe disruption to passenger journeys. Chambers yesterday told Newstalk's Hard Shoulder that Dublin Airport should have the counter-drone technology in place within a number of weeks. In a statement this evening, daa CEO Kenny Jacobs said: We are glad the State has made a decision on this important issue. Given this is a state-wide issue, we remain of the view that the ultimate owners of this must be An Garda Sochna or the Department of Defence. However, we are already progressing this at pace in the interests of the public safety and to prevent travel disruption. Exact timelines cannot be confirmed just yet given the requirement to identify and procure the most suitable technology, engage with the Irish Aviation Authority on its use and train those that will ultimately deploy it. Advertisement He added: But we are moving very quickly, and we will have this technology in place as soon as possible. Education Separately tomorrow, Education Minister Norma Foley will update Cabinet today on the new primary curriculum framework which sets out that children will spend more time learning foreign languages, science, technology and their wellbeing. The new primary curriculum compiled by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is due to be published this week. It maps out an overhaul of the curriculum which will see children in third class onwards spending one hour a week to learn a language that is not English or Irish. There is a new focus on science, technology, engineering and maths education, while children will spend up to three hours per week on wellbeing programmes. With much debate centered around the role religion plays in out national schools, the subject is to be reduced by half an hour, to two hours per week, with students also set to be taught ethical and multi-belief education. In addition, Justice Minister Harris will seek Government approval today give the go-ahead to a major student accommodation project at DCU. An allocation of 40 million will go towards building the new 405 bed building on campus, with 30 of the project to be ring fenced for students from a disadvantaged area at a reduced rent. The minister will also confirm work is ongoing with UCD, Trinity and UCC on similar projects and he expects to revert to Government with further proposals shortly. The Minister will state this policy will help more student access accommodation and also relieve some of the pressures in the housing market. Similar Government support has been provided for University of Limerick, University of Galway and Maynooth University, with Government approval provided for these projects in November. Meanwhile, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly will ask Cabinet to sign off on the Health (Amendment) Bill 2023, which will abolish the statutory public inpatient charges of 80 per day, up to a maximum of 800 in a year. The measure, which was announced in last year's budget, will mean people will no longer be charged when accessing public inpatient care in our public hospitals.

The blockbuster trial -- originally set to begin in a Delaware court on Monday before being delayed by one day -- will determine whether Fox Corporation can be held liable for false claims made on Fox News, the media company's namesake cable TV property, that Dominion's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election. Dominion's lawsuit seeks 1.6 billion in compensatory damages, an amount that experts said would likely be whittled down substantially depending on the jury's judgment or in an out-of-court settlement. The media company contests any claims of liability or damages sought by Dominion, with a Fox spokesperson calling the lawsuit a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights. In the event Dominion wins its case, said Lyrissa Lidsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of Florida, the jury is highly unlikely to award Dominion all the money it is seeking for what it says is the reputational damage exacted by Fox News' broadcasts. In theory, Lidsky said, the jurors could also impose punitive damages to punish Fox for extremely wrongful conduct and award an even higher financial penalty than Dominion asked for. But she said she had seen no evidence thus far that suggests there are going to be damages at that magnitude, even though the damages may be very large. There is a litigation strategy to ask for more than you think you can really get to anchor the number high, Lidsky explained. With more than 4 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of the end of 2022, Fox could probably cover even the maximum amount that Dominion is seeking without having to sell any of its existing assets to do so. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Fox said it did not expect the ultimate resolution of any claims from the suit to have a material adverse effect on its business. Wall Street analysts say the publicly traded company's stock is likely to take a hit as a result of the suit. Bank of America Securities estimated in a March 28 note that for every 500 million in damages, shares of Fox Corporation would lose about 1 per share. The company's stock, which was trading at 33.62 late Monday morning, has fallen by more than 10 since Dominion filed its lawsuit in March 2021, a period in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 2. BofA Securities suggested that the lawsuit was likely to keep Fox's stock from moving substantially over the course of what is expected to be a six-week trial as legal proceedings continue to unearth details about debates inside Fox over its airing of falsehoods about Dominion. At a minimum, the constant barrage of negative headlines should be an overhang on near-term investor sentiment, the BofA Securities analysts wrote. The Fox spokesperson did not comment on the business impact of any damages it might have to shoulder or on its stock outlook. The case has also raised scrutiny on the media company's editorial strategy as signs have emerged of gaps between what was reported on air and what some insiders -- apparently with an eye on Fox's business -- indicated they knew to be true. Details from the case show Fox News personalities growing increasingly concerned about losing viewers to competing network Newsmax in the days following the 2020 election. Texts and emails disclosed in Dominion's filing suggest that Fox hosts then pushed back against efforts to set the record straight on the outcome of the election -- allegedly to keep viewers from changing the channel. Following an instance in which a Fox reporter noted that there was no evidence of voting system fraud, prime time host Tucker Carlson texted fellow Fox anchor Sean Hannity calling for her to be fired. It is measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke, Carlson texted on November 12, 2020. The company's 2019 decision to exit its TV and movie businesses may have added pressure to hang on to viewers, said Gabriel Kahn, a journalism professor at the University of Southern California. After Disney purchased the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox for 71 billion in 2019, the remainder of Rupert Murdoch's media company -- known henceforth as Fox Corporation -- became focused on its news, sports and business broadcast operations. After the deal, Kahn said, they doubled down on polarization and audience fragmentation, adding that it became absolutely, existentially important to keep that audience engaged. Still, Fox News dominates the cable news rankings. According to Nielsen live plus data, The Five, Tucker Carlson Tonight and Jesse Watters Primetime were the three most-watched cable news shows in 2022. Over that time, Fox's advertising revenue grew by almost 9. The relationship between editorial decisions at Fox and the company's business strategy, Lidsky said, could be relevant in the case as Dominion tries to prove that Fox aired false information with reckless disregard -- part of the legal standard that will be key in determining whether Dominion was defamed. A business incentive to ignore the truth or falsity of what they were putting out there, that might tend to show reckless disregard, Lidsky said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fox-likely-survive-nine-figure-loss-dominion-analysts-say-rcna79364,0,"Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox Corporation for $1.6 billion in damages.

It has pitched the needs of tillage farmers and the rapidly growing brewing industry against the desire of locals to protect the rural character of their area, and to limit further heavy truck movements on roads already under severe pressure from the quarrying operations in their area. But, as the value of Irish whiskey exports soars, exceeding 1bn for the first time last year -- and with Irish Distillers, unconnected to this situation, but planning a 250m expansion of its Midleton distillery nearby which will lead to a near 50 increase in its demand for barley and malted barley -- it is a row likely to be seen again. Many residents gathered at the site of the proposed grain storage facility last week to demonstrate their anger, and said they have written to the board calling for a reversal of the decision ahead of the deadline later this week, for the lodging of a possible judicial review. They say many of the issues cited by the board in its decision to refuse planning to another applicant for a much larger truck haulage depot operation on the same site in 2007 are still valid. They say they have serious concerns about the development's potential impact on the designated Metropolitan Cork greenbelt, on the rural character of the area, of its impact on the road network and road safety in an area already struggling to cope with heavy trucks linked to several extensive quarry operations, and on the potential for noise, pest, and dust nuisance. They conducted their own 12-hour traffic survey last week which they say shows, unofficially at least, a 50 increase on traffic volumes compared to the applicant's figures, some of which they say were gathered during covid, and do not reflect the reality on the ground. They said: No matter how it is dressed up, and whatever boxes have been ticked off to make it technically viable for planners to give permission, getting up to 30,000 tonnes of barley in and out of this site annually is going to have a huge negative impact on us residents. In a statement, Owenacurra Agri said the company had engaged with concerned locals in the area prior to submitting the planning application. All issues of concern have been dealt with through the planning process at both Cork County Council and An Bord Pleanla. The company would like to take the opportunity to thank all those in support of this project, it said. The site in Barryscourt is about 1.25km south of Carrigtwohill, about 1km along a local road from the N25. The 15th century Barryscourt Castle, which is undergoing restoration, is about 850m to the north west. The site was previously owned by BECAUSE Transport, which was refused planning in 2007 on four key grounds -- including its location in the greenbelt -- for a large haulage depot with parking for 100 trucks and 54 cars and a truck servicing building. It was considered at the time that the industrial nature of the depot would contravene specific objectives in the then county development plan to preserve the character of the greenbelt, and to reserve it generally for use as agriculture, open space, or recreation. It was shot down also because of its location in an unserviced rural area, at a significant distance from the strategic road network, and on grounds that the proposed development could endanger public safety as the local road network was inadequate to cater for the substantial increase in truck movements likely to be generated by the depot. Owenacurra Agri's successful plan The site changed ownership and was eventually acquired in early 2020 by father and son, Maurice and Cormac Smiddy, who run Midleton-based Owenacurra Agri, a division of Southern Fuel and Farm Supplies. Owenacurra Agri lodged a planning application with Cork County Council in March 2021 for the construction of a large 2,827 sq m agricultural grain store, with three storage bays, a silo, elevators, conveyors, and a drying and air handling plant on part of the site. No mock-up images showing the proposed structure were included in the application. Some 46 submissions were made, most objecting to the development, many flagging a range of planning policy and road safety issues, which were also flagged in 2007. One submission highlighted the scale of the proposed building in a rural setting, which at four storeys high, and four to five times as long, it said could be compared to an industrial unit normally found in industrial estates. Following a request for further information on a range of issues, including the development's potential impact on roads and traffic, a raft of documents were submitted, including a visual impact assessment with CGI images of the proposed structure, and planning was granted in November 2021 with 44 conditions. Decision appealed That decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanla by Pat and John Ahern, who live close by, by Frank and Catherine Brennan, and by Caroline Harte, whose submission residents say represents the vast majority of the 46 submissions made to the council. An observation was also made by An Taisce, flagging concerns about the potential visual impact on Barryscourt Castle. The appeals argued that the grain store should be considered a commercial, and not an agricultural operation, they raised concerns about its impact on roads and road safety, on the visual character of the area, on nearby homes, of potential overshadowing of adjoining fields, as well as potential noise, dust, and pest nuisance. Residents also pointed out that any road improvements since the rejected project in 2007 have been minor and cosmetic, and they pointed out that since, a major EU cycling route has been now designated nearby. Inspector's report In her report, An Bord Pleanla inspector Siobhn Carroll noted that since the Cork County Development Plan 2022-2028 came into effect last June, the subject site is located outside of the area which is designated as prominent and strategic metropolitan greenbelt and is located on unzoned rural lands. She said the development plan refers to agriculture and farm diversification and seeks to encourage the development of sustainable agriculture and related infrastructure including farm buildings. Ms Carroll added: I would consider that the proposed agricultural grain store does come within the scope of related agricultural infrastructure. She accepted that the applicant had provided a clear case for the specific requirement for the grain store at this location, and said she considered it as an appropriate use to this rural area. She said the proposal for green cladding on the warehouse and tree screening would reduce the visual intrusion upon the surrounding landscape to low to imperceptible. She also said she was satisfied that the surrounding road network can accommodate the traffic levels which would be generated by the proposed development. She recommended a condition imposing certain noise limits on the facility at certain times, the need for a comprehensive noise survey to be undertaken by the applicant during each grain drying season, and a condition dealing with dust emissions, dust control, and directing that there shall be no open storage of grain on the site. However, residents said all the conditions in the world will make little or no difference, and they expressed concerns that operations at the site could expand in the future. The roads are not designed to accommodate current HGV traffic, not to mention the additional haulage of up to 30,000 tonnes of barley. The man on the street can see an agricultural farm being turned into a commercial warehousing centre in front of our eyes, they said.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/munster/arid-41122210.html,0,"Residents living near Carrigtwohill in east Cork have strongly criticised An Bord Pleanla's decision to uphold Cork County Council's grant of planning to Owenacurra Agri.

It is the first time Italy has resorted to such a drastic measure since 2011, the height of the European migrant crisis. Italy's Ministry for Civil Protection and Maritime Policies said the measure was necessary due to the surging numbers of people coming to Italy since the beginning of the year, plus overcrowding in facilities in hotspots like the tiny island of Lampedusa. Since the beginning of the year, some 31,000 migrants have arrived in Italy according to data from the Interior Ministry - more than triple the year before. Many were either rescued by Italian military boats or humanitarian ships or reached Italy's shores without any assistance. The number of arrivals is expected to carry on soaring as the weather improves in the spring and summer, with 3,000 people making landfall in the last five days alone. The state of emergency -- which will last for six months -- will dispense initial funding of 5 million euros. Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government says this will be used to create new structures, suitable both for sheltering as well as the processing and repatriation of migrants who do not have the requisites to stay. New facilities will mean Italy can identify and repatriate more people who are not allowed to stay, as Rome continues its years-long effort to crack down on illegal immigration. Known as CPR in Italy, they are marred with controversy. For years, NGOs and human rights groups have criticised what they call inhumane and degrading conditions inside migrant facilities. While the last time Italy declared a state of emergency over illegal immigration was in 2011 -- during the fourth government of media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi -- the country has recently declared a state of emergency over other issues. One was declared in 2020 over the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for the government to mandate by decree and temporarily bypass the long parliamentary process for funding and regulations. Meloni's government is currently trying to pass a series of policies targeting migrants. Measures under consideration will speed up the process of identifying and processing individuals who do not qualify to stay in Italy. They could also abolish or modify rules around the special protection status granted to asylum seekers who cannot be considered refugees but cannot be expelled because they are considered at risk. Though requirements around special protection status used to be strict, a 2020 reform extended it to anyone who suffers persecution in their country of origin because of race, sex, gender, identity, citizenship, religion, political opinion, and personal or social conditions. In 2022, some 10,000 people qualified for special protection status in Italy. Meloni's government claims restricting access to it will deter migrants from making the perilous journey from North Africa to Italy, which would help prevent tragedies like the one near Cutreo, in the southern region of Calabria, when 93 died after a horrific shipwreck in Feburary. The Italian government says the state of emergency is just a temporary fix to a problem which requires a European-wide solution. According to Matteo Salvini, now Deputy Prime Minister, Europe needs to wake up and intervene: for years it has been talking without ever moving a finger, and now it is the time to show that there is a community, a Union, and solidarity does not fall just on Italy, Spain, Greece or Malta. The far-right politician called for Europe to contribute to Italy's efforts to cope with migrant arrivals, saying that rescue efforts, as well as processing procedures, are unsustainable for the country economically, culturally, socially. But while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently declared that it is clear that migration is a European challenge that requires a European solution, Italy says it has not yet received the support it needs to face the growing influx of migrants. Euronews has contacted Italy's Ministry for Civil Protection and Maritime Policies for comment.",https://www.euronews.com/2023/04/13/why-has-italy-declared-a-state-of-emergency-over-migration-what-does-it-mean-in-practice,0,"Italy has declared a state of emergency over the sharp rise in the number of migrants arriving on the country's shores.

Israel has attacked Aleppo airport several times in recent years. (File) Damascus: Israeli warplanes struck Aleppo airport before dawn Tuesday, causing significant damage that halted flights to and from Syria's war- and quake-battered second city, the defence ministry said. The airport has been a major conduit for aid flights since a February 6 earthquake devastated swathes of southeastern Turkey and neighbouring Syria, and they too were brought to a stop, a transport ministry official said. At exactly 2:07 am (2307 GMT Monday), the Israeli enemy carried out an air attack from the Mediterranean west of Latakia targeting Aleppo international airport, Syria's defence ministry said in a statement. The damage forced authorities to close the airport to all flights, the ministry added. There was no immediate word on any casualties. More than 80 aid flights have landed in Aleppo over the past month with relief supplies for quake-hit areas, transport ministry official Suleiman Khalil told AFP. It is no longer possible to receive aid flights until the damage has been repaired, he said, adding that the strike had put the runway out of service. Aid deliveries have been diverted to Damascus and Latakia airports, a ministry statement said. An Israeli military spokesperson declined to comment on the reported strike. It marked the second Israeli attack on government-held areas since the devastating quake struck Turkey and Syria, killing more than 50,000 people in the two countries. On February 19, an Israeli strike killed 15 people in a Damascus district housing state security agencies. Israel has attacked Aleppo airport several times in recent years, with a strike last September putting it out of service for a few days. Since civil war erupted in Syria in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes against its neighbour, primarily targeting positions of the Syrian army and its Iranian and Hezbollah allies.

(Credit: Raymond Rodriguez via Storyful) A tornado tore through a Southern California community on Wednesday, injuring one person and damaging structures. The National Weather Service Office in Los Angeles said that the rare twister was an EF1, a measurement on the Enhanced Fujita Scale that indicates it had winds of 86 to 110 mph. It touched down shortly before 11:15 a.m. PT in Montebello, and was the strongest tornado to hit the Los Angeles metropolitan area since March 1983. The agency said its path was 50 yards wide and that it was on the ground for two to three minutes. CALIFORNIA HAMMERED BY STRONG STORM, AT LEAST 2 DEAD Alex Gillman, a spokesman for the city, said one person was hurt and taken to the hospital. He did not know the severity of the injury. The National Weather Service said 17 structures were damaged, with 11 significantly impacted and red-tagged as uninhabitable. A tree was uprooted and a power pole was snapped with the transformer ripped off. The tornado primarily ripped through an industrial warehouse and commercial business district. Cars there were damaged and a near-total roof collapse occurred in one building. Warehouse roofing material collapsed and an HVAC unit was ejected from the top of the building. Skylights were broken and wood cross beams came down. ARMY CORP INVESTIGATING NEW ORLEANS FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM AFTER DRAINAGE PUMP CORRODED IN 5 YEARS It got very loud.

The Russian leader reportedly discussed the war with a general from Moscow's airborne troops, who has reportedly taken up a powerful new role in the invasion. Dressed in a heavy blue jacket, Mr Putin was shown on Russian state television descending from a military helicopter in south Kherson and greeting senior military commanders. It is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information, Mr Putin told the commanders. It comes as reports suggest that French president Emmanuel Macron is working on a set of secret plans with China which could bring an end to Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Mr Macron has reportedly deployed his foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne to work in tandem with China's top diplomat Wang Yi to establish a framework that could bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table by this summer. 08:12 , Katy Clifton Vladimir Putin has visited military headquarters in Russian-controlled Ukraine, the Kremlin said this morning, where he discussed the war with a general from Russia's airborne troops who has reportedly taken up a powerful new role in the invasion. Moscow claims to have annexed four Ukrainian regions but its forces are locked in a grinding artillery battle in the eastern Donbas with heavy losses on both sides, while they have been forced to pull back in southern Kherson, which Mr Putin visited. Dressed in a heavy blue jacket, Mr Putin, 70, was shown on Russian state television descending from a military helicopter in Russian-held Ukraine and greeting senior military commanders. The Kremlin said Mr Putin attended a military command meeting in Kherson region. He heard reports from commanders of the airborne forces and the Dnieper army group and other senior officers on the situation in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. It is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information, Putin told the commanders, including colonel-general Mikhail Teplinsky, commander of Russia's airborne troops. British military intelligence said on Sunday that Teplinsky had been given a major role in the war. Teplinsky, commander of Russia's corps of airborne troops, the VDV, has highly likely returned to a major role in Ukraine, British military intelligence said. Teplinsky is likely one of the few senior Russian generals widely respected by the rank-and-file. 15:52 , Emily Atkinson Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops in the small eastern city of Avdiivka on Tuesday, thanked them for their service and was briefed by commanders on the battlefield situation, his office said. Avdiivka has been one of the main targets of a Russian winter offensive which was intended to reinvigorate Moscow's full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, but has made only small territorial advances in the east. Video footage released by Zelensky's office showed him addressing troops in combat gear and handing them awards in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse with sandbags packed against at least one of the high walls. I have the honour to be here today, to thank you for your service, for defending our land, Ukraine, our families, he said. I wish you only victory - this is what I wish for every Ukrainian, this is what is very important to all of us. Zelensky also visited a hospital where he met wounded soldiers and handed out awards. 15:24 , Emily Atkinson Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will discuss the Ukraine Black Sea export deal with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres when they meet in New York next week, Russia's envoy said on Tuesday. Of course, he will be raising that during his bilateral, Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters. 14:35 , Emily Atkinson French president Emmanuel Macron is working on a set of secret plans with China which could bring an end to Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, reports suggest. Mr Macron has reportedly deployed his foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne to work in tandem with China's top diplomat Wang Yi to establish a framework that could bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table by this summer. Sources familiar with the French initiative told Bloomberg that future talks would depend on several conditions, including a successful Ukrainian spring offensive that would boost Kyiv's position during negotiations. Bloomberg claims that official from Mr Macron's office had confirmed the plan for Mr Bonne to speak with Mr Wang. Romania looked set on Tuesday to follow three other countries in banning Ukrainian grain imports, a setback for Kyiv as it tries to unblock exports through eastern Europe and salvage a wartime deal on shipping grain from the Black Sea. Failure to resume exports into eastern European countries or secure an extension of the Black Sea grain deal would trap large amounts of grain in Ukraine, hitting its exports and causing further economic problems for Kyiv as it battles Russian troops. Talks between Kyiv and Warsaw went into a second day after European Union member states Poland, Hungary and Slovakia imposed import bans to protect their markets from an influx of cheaper supply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party increased pressure on Kyiv by saying it would ask the coalition government to approve an emergency decree enforcing a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports though it wants transit to continue. 12:58 , William Mata A Russian judge on Tuesday upheld the detention of jailed American journalist Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested on spying charges as part of a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on dissent amid the war in Ukraine. Mr Gershkovich and the US government vehemently deny the allegations. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter is the first US correspondent since the Cold War to be detained in Russia on spying allegations and his arrest rattled journalists in the country and elicited outrage in the West. Dozens of journalists crowded into the courtroom to catch a glimpse of Mr Gershkovich, who looked calm as he stood inside a glass cage to appeal his detention. Russia's federal security service detained the 31-year-old in Yekaterinburg in March and accused him of trying to obtain classified information about a Russian arms factory. Gershkovich, his employer and the US government deny he was involved in spying and have demanded his release. Evan is a member of the free press who right up until he was arrested was engaged in newsgathering. Any suggestions otherwise are false, the WSJ has said in a statement. Last week, the US officially declared that Mr Gershkovich was wrongfully detained. Russia has accused the ambassadors of Britain, the United States and Canada of interfering in its internal affairs after they condemned the treason conviction of a prominent opposition politician and it warned them they risk expulsion in future. On Monday, a Moscow court jailed Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza - who holds Russia and British passports - for 25 years after convicting him of treason in a trial he and the West said was politically-motivated. It was the harshest sentence of its kind since Russia invaded Ukraine. Kara-Murza, 41, for years successfully lobbied Western governments to impose sanctions on Russia and individual Russians for purported human rights violations. He also condemned what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. The ambassadors of Britain, the United States and Canada made a joint appearance in front of TV cameras on the steps of the Moscow court after his verdict to condemn the ruling and demand his release. British ambassador Deborah Bronnert delivered her remarks in Russian so that Russian-language TV channels could potentially broadcast them. Russia's Foreign Ministry said the diplomats' behaviour was unacceptable. 12:00 , William Mata Ukraine will try to unblock exports of food and grain through Poland in a second day of talks in Warsaw on Tuesday after some of its staunchest allies in central Europe imposed bans on its products. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have recently banned imports of Ukrainian grains and produce to protect their markets from an influx of cheaper supply. Ukraine's exports via these countries have risen due to Russia's invasion, which has blocked some of its Black Sea ports. Bottlenecks caused by slowed rail shipments or a lack of railcars have exacerbated the problem, trapping large quantities of Ukrainian grain in Central Europe which has lowered prices and hurt sales by local farmers, turning up the heat on governments. 11:30 , William Mata Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko held a meeting with the Russian-installed head of Ukraine's Donetsk region on Tuesday, the state-run Belta news agency reported. It follows a meeting between Mr Lukashenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier in the month (pictured below). Belarus has been a key backer of Russia as many western nations have turned against the Kremlin after the invasion of Ukraine. Hired by the Wall Street Journal shortly before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year, Gershkovich had been reporting on Russia for more than five years at the time of his arrest. The 31-year-old is a fluent Russian-speaker, the son of emigres who left the Soviet Union for the United States during the Cold War. What were the circimstances of his arrest? The FSB security service said on March 30 it had arrested him for trying to gather secrets about Russia's military-industrial complex during a trip to Yekaterinburg, 1,400 km (880 miles) east of Moscow. His newspaper said it last heard from him the previous day when he arrived at a steakhouse in the city. He was brought back to the capital and charged with espionage, for which he faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He has denied the charge, which is also rejected by his newspaper. What do the United States and Russia say about the case? President Joe Biden has called Russia's treatment of Gershkovich totally illegal. The United States last week officially designated him as wrongfully detained, effectively saying that the spy charges were bogus and the case was political. The Kremlin says Gershkovich was caught red-handed, but Russia has yet to publish any evidence to support that. Where is he being held? Gershkovich is in pre-trial detention at Moscow's Lefortovo prison, where the FSB and its predecessor, the Soviet KGB, have traditionally held those suspected of spying or other grave crimes. YOU.S. ambassador Lynne Tracy was able to visit him there for the first time on Monday but gave few details, except that he was healthy and bearing up well. In a handwritten letter dated April 5 to his parents, Gershkovich said he was reading, writing, taking exercise and not losing hope. What happens next? Tuesday's hearing is essentially procedural - about how Gershkovich should be detained as he awaits trial, not about the substance of the charges. Investigators are still working on the details of the case, which could drag on for months or years if the example of fellow American Paul Whelan is anything to go by. Whelan, a former Marine, was arrested in December 2018, held for 18 months in Lefortovo and jailed for 16 years in June 2020 on spying charges. He too is designated by Washington as wrongfully detained. 10:30 , William Mata Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will appeal on Tuesday against his arrest and detention in a former KGB prison in Moscow on charges of espionage, according to court documents. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 30 it had detained Gershkovich in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and had opened an espionage case against him for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military industrial complex. Gershkovich, the first YOU.S. journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, and the Journal have denied he was involved in espionage, as has Washington. According to a public Russian judicial document, a Russian court will hear on Tuesday a complaint filed by Gershkovich against the decision to keep him in custody in Lefortovo prison while the case is being investigated. 10:00 , William Mata The G7 drew together on Tuesday to criticise China's coercion of Taiwan and Russia's threat to station nuclear weapons in Belarus, promising to intensify sanctions on Moscow for its war on neighbouring Ukraine. The strength of the solidarity between the G7 foreign ministers is at a level not seen before, Japan's foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a news conference after hosting a meeting of the group in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa. The show of unity comes after French president Emmanuel Macron this month said the European Union should reduce its dependency on the United States and cautioned against being drawn into a Taiwan crisis. Beijing views Taiwan as Chinese territory and has not renounced the use of force to take the democratically governed island. 09:30 , William Mata Russian forces are stepping up their use of heavy artillery and air strikes in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces said on Tuesday. Fighting in and around Bakhmut has for months been the epicentre of the war in Ukraine. Currently, the enemy is increasing the activity of heavy artillery and the number of air strikes, turning the city into ruins, General Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a statement. He said Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, remained committed to taking Bakhmut at any cost but was suffering significant losses in the battle for the city. Reuters could not confirm the battlefield situation. Russia says Ukrainian forces have also suffered heavy losses in Bakhmut. 09:00 , William Mata Poland and Ukraine will resume negotiations early on Tuesday to try to reopen the transit of food and grains, the Polish agriculture minister told public radio station PR1. Reuters reported two countries held talks on Monday over bans by central eastern European countries seeking to shelter their farmers from the impact of an influx of cheaper Ukrainian grain. Some Black Sea ports were blocked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and large quantities of Ukrainian grain has been trapped in Central Europe because of logistical bottlenecks. We are talking with the EU as well as with Ukraine to find solutions. We want these products to go to Europe, but go deep into Europe, agriculture minister Robert Telus said. We talked yesterday, there were long talks. Today we are also sitting down for talks...These are typically technical talks to find a solution and let this transit go to Europe, he added. 07:30 , Katy Clifton Russia's defence ministry has said this morning that two Russian strategic bombers - those capable of carrying nuclear warheads - carried out routine patrol flights over the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, off Russia's Far East. The statement was reported by the TASS news agency. 07:17 , Arpan Rai A new Pentagon leak has found that Egypt revoked its plans to share thousands of rockets with Russia after talks with senior US officials and instead offered to provide artillery shells for Ukraine. The idea to give rockets to Vladimir Putin was ditched in early March by Egyptian president Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, reported the Washington Post. The US ally then decided to sell 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine via Washington despite the ammunition stockpiles running low in the US. Egypt's president had reportedly ordered 40,000 rockets to be discreetly shipped to Russia, according to some of the classified US intelligence documents that were recently leaked on social media. Discussions between high-level Egyptian officials about the sale of weapons to Russia were found in the series of classified files, reported The Washington Post. The leaked documents made their way to gaming social media platform Discord in February and March. 07:04 , AP Slovakia became the third European Union country to ban food imports from Ukraine on Monday, deepening the challenge for the bloc as it works to help Ukraine transport its grain to world markets, reports Vanessa Gera. Slovakia followed Poland and Hungary, both of which announced bans Saturday on Ukrainian food imports until 30 June. They did so in response to rising anger from farmers who say that a glut of grain in their countries is causing them economic hardship. The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, manages trade on behalf of the 27 member countries and objects to them taking unilateral or uncoordinated measures. EU investigates after 3 countries ban Ukraine grain imports 06:58 , Arpan Rai Russia is likely reorganising its forces and diverting its troops and ammunition in the direction of Bakhmut, the British defence ministry said today as it noted heavy fighting along the Donbas front line. However, there is a realistic possibility that Russia has reduced troop numbers and is decreasing offensive action around Donetsk city, most likely to divert resources towards the Bakhmut sector, the MoD said in its latest intelligence update. It added that Bakhmut has witnessed creeping advances by Russian MoD and Wagner Group forces. The frontline in the town centre largely follows the main railway line, the MoD said. Ukraine is generally holding Russia's envelopment from the south along the line of Korsunskovo Street, the old main road west out of town. For both sides, the exact sequencing of any major drawdown of their units around Bakhmut has become a critical question, with Ukraine wanting to free-up an offensive force while Russia likely aspires to regenerate an operational reserve, the ministry said. 06:40 , Arpan Rai More than 80,500 Russian war crimes, crimes of aggression by Moscow's forces have been recorded in Ukraine, the war-hit country's prosecutor general's office said. The Russian forces have committed 80,840 war crimes and crimes of aggression in Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February last year, the prosecutor general's office said yesterday. 06:35 , Arpan Rai The Group of Seven industrial powers have warned of severe consequences if nuclear weapons are used in Ukraine as their foreign ministers met in Tokyo today. The group, which comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, called Russia's threat to put nuclear weapons in Belarus unacceptable. Any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine would be met with severe consequences, the G7 said. The alliance said that they are more united than ever as they also slammed China's added pressure on Taiwan in addition to Russia's threat to station nuclear weapons in Belarus. The G7 communique highlights how the dual issues of Russian military intervention and fears of similar action by China against Taiwan have been a focus of the three-day meeting. 06:11 , Andy Gregory American journalist Evan Gershkovich, a 31-year-old reporter for The Wall Street Journal, has been arrested and detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. My colleague Joe Sommerlad has this explainer on his arrest: What we know about arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia 05:14 , Andy Gregory Washington's ambassador to Russia has made her first visit in jail to Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter accused by Moscow of spying. This is the first time we have had consular access to Evan since his wrongful detention over two weeks ago, said Lynne Tracy in a short statement in Russian on Telegram. He feels well and is holding up. We reiterate our call for Evan's immediate release. 04:51 , Arpan Rai Vladimir Putin is again helping the Wagner Group of mercenaries by providing arms and ammunition along with political recognition after the conventional Russian military forces failed to meet a 1 April deadline to capture Luhansk and Donetsk, experts monitoring the war said. Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin is seemingly regaining some favour with Russian president Vladimir Putin, likely as a result of the Russian conventional military's inability to accomplish the tasks Putin had set for it during the winter offensive in Donbas, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the Russian offensive in Ukraine. It added that the Wagner forces are likely receiving reinforcements, ammunition, and political recognition - which is a stark deviation from the Kremlin's previous efforts to expend Wagner forces and Prigozhin in Bakhmut since at least January 2023. On the battle field, Wagner has been asked to train mobilised personnel to reinforce Wagner's positions in Bakhmut. Prigozhin also confirmed that Russian airborne forces (VDV) are operating alongside Wagner and indicated that Wagner is actively receiving artillery shells. Prigozhin advocated for Wagner to receive more artillery shells, which indicates that Prigozhin has reestablished his supply of ammunition from the Russian ministry of defence, the US-based think-tank said. The extent of Putin's trust and favour for Prigozhin is unclear at this time, but it is likely that Putin halted the Russian MoD's efforts to avenge Wagner by denying Wagner reinforcements and ammunition, the ISW said. 04:20 , Arpan Rai Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine is readying for a second Ramstein meeting of what he referred to as an anti-war coalition. The first round of Ramstein discussions happened in January this year, which saw defence leaders from across the world gathering at Ramstein Air Base in Germany as they hammered out future military aid to Ukraine. By the way, we are already preparing for another Ramstein meeting. I held preparatory meetings. And we expect solidly grounded decisions that will meet the prospects on the battlefield. Quite ambitious prospects, which we are approaching with all our might. Moreover, we are approaching them not only for ourselves, not only for Ukraine but also for our entire anti-war coalition, Mr Zelensky said. He added: The aggressor must lose. And this is our joint responsibility with our partners - to gain more time for peace, that is, to be as active as possible now in providing weapons and ammunition to speed up our joint victory. Russia is once again holding up Ukrainian grain in the Black Sea and blocking the grains onboard at least 50 ships, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. The European Union will continue facilitating exports through the EU solidarity lanes on Ukraine-EU land borders, the top official said, adding that the route has brought 25 billion tons of grain to the world. This is the second time Russia has been accused of blocking grain shipment from Ukraine after invading the country in February last year. In May last year, satellite images showed two Russian carrier ships loading up mounds of grain in Ukraine even as the global food supplies remained threatened by Moscow's invasion. 03:02 , Reuters Moldova has warned Russian politicians not to meddle in its internal affairs, after barring a Russian delegation from entering the country ahead of a regional election. The delegation led by Rustam Minnikhanov, governor of Russia's Tatarstan region, had been due to attend a forum in semi-autonomous Gagauzia region, which holds elections on 30 April to name the head of its government. Moldova, which applied to join the European Union last year alongside its neighbour Ukraine, has repeatedly accused Russia of trying to destabilise the country, something Moscow denies. Mr Minnikhanov arrived in an official Tatarstan government plane but was not allowed off the aircraft. Police said in a statement his trip aimed to bolster support for a pro-Russian candidate standing at the elections. Supporting a candidate at local elections in Moldova is not a valid reason and the authorities ask Russian bureaucrats to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of our country, the border guard service said. 01:53 , Andy Gregory Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has claimed during a visit to Brazil that Moscow wants its war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible. At a news conference with his Brazilian counterpart Mauro Vieira, Mr Lavrov thanked Brazil for its understanding of the genesis of the situation in Ukraine and said Russia had an interest in the conflict ending as soon as possible. Russia has repeatedly said that any settlement of the conflict must acknowledge the realities of its unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions, which its armed forces partly control. Tuesday 18 April 2023 00:41 , PA British nationals are not safe in Russia, a senior MP has warned, after a British-Russian opposition leader was jailed for 25 years by a Moscow court. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, urged the government to call any British nationals living in Russia home. She described the sentencing of outspoken Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza as a farce and said ministers should be working to get him out. New Zealand premier Chris Hipkins has announced he will attend the upcoming Nato summit in July, while Australia's leader said he was still considering whether to travel. Both countries have a decades-long relationship with the military alliance which has taken on greater importance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with both attending last year's summit in Madrid as non-member participants. Mr Hipkins said he would seek to advance a trade agreement with the European Union while at the July summit in Vilnius. Local media previously reported that Australia's Anthony Albanese would not travel to the summit, but he told ABC on Monday that no decision had been made, adding: I have not had a chance yet to talk to the Nato secretary general ... I will give it consideration. I attended last year in Madrid and subject to logistical arrangements, then I would be very pleased to accept the invitation. Monday 17 April 2023 21:51 , Andy Gregory Russia's foreign minster has thanked Brazil for its efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine ahead of a visit with president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose remarks on Vladimir Putin's war have unnerved Washington. Sergei Lavrov and Brazil's foreign relations minister Mauro Vieira addressed journalists after a meeting in Brasilia, discussing plans to boost meat exports to Russia and secure fertiliser imports for Brazilian farmers. Mr Lavrov will meet later on Monday with Lula, who has proposed forming a group of nations not involved in the Russia-Ukraine war to broker peace and discussed the matter in China with counterpart Xi Jinping last weekend. The United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace, Lula said upon his return. We are trying to build a group of countries without any involvement in the war, that do not want the war and defend world peace to have a discussion with both Russia and Ukraine, he said in separate remarks to journalists. But we also have to talk to the United States and European Union. That is, we have to convince people that peace is the way. Monday 17 April 2023 21:04 , Andy Gregory Though it remains unchallenged for now, the United States cannot take the US dollar's continued role as the go-to currency for world trade for granted, the president of the European Central Bank has warned. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Christine Lagarde warned that a more splintered and less efficient world economy will make it harder for central banks to contain inflation. Her speech comes as China, Russia and other countries seek to wean themselves off dependence on the US, which has sought to use its dominance to impose sanctions, most notably on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine last year. Lagarde: US-China split may weaken growth and fuel inflation Monday 17 April 2023 20:14 , Andy Gregory The wife of a British-Russian opposition leader jailed for 25 years has said she is baffled that those involved in his trial have not yet been sanctioned by the UK. Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to prison by a court in Moscow after he was convicted of treason and denigrating the Russian military in proceedings the Kremlin critic called a show trial. The dissident's wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, said that while she was grateful for the support of the Foreign Office, which has condemned the decision, she feels the UK should do more. I would very much like to see the British Government actually doing something in Vladimir's case, Ms Kara-Murza said. I would like to see the British Government introduce sanctions against the violators of my husband's rights. Canada has already introduced sanctions even though he is not a Canadian citizen, as have the US and Latvia. She added: I know that the UK authorities have had a list of the violators for months, so I am honestly baffled that these sanctions have not been introduced. Monday 17 April 2023 19:33 , Andy Gregory Ukrainian infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov will visit Turkey on Tuesday to discuss the status of a deal that allows the safe wartime export of grain from several Ukrainian Black Sea ports, the Turkish defence ministry said on Monday. Kubrakov will meet Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar in the central Turkish city of Kayseri, a ministry statement said. The UN-brokered Black Sea grain export deal was renewed for 60 days last month, but Russia has been signalling it may not agree to extend it further unless the West removes obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertiliser. Ukraine said on Monday the grain accord was in danger of shutdown after Russia blocked inspections of participating ships in Turkish waters. Ukrainian Black Sea ports were blockaded after Russia's invasion last year, but access to three of them was cleared last July under a deal engineered by the United Nations and Turkey. Kubrakov will visit at the invitation of Akar, the ministry statement said, adding that ministers will discuss several bilateral issues including the Black Sea grain initiative. Monday 17 April 2023 18:47 , Andy Gregory The Wagner mercenary group has captured two districts in the centre and northwest of Bakhmut, Russia's Defence Ministry claimed today. Bloody battles unprecedented in recent decades are taking place in the middle of the city's urban area, Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern military command said on Saturday. Our soldiers are doing everything in bloody and fierce battles to grind down the enemy's combat capability and break its morale. Every day, in every corner of this city, they are successfully doing so, he told the 11 television channel. Volodymyr Zelensky's forces have clung on in the frontline city in a seemingly successful bid to inflict heavy losses on Vladimir Putin's armies, but Britain's Ministry of Defence warned on Friday that Ukraine had been forced to concede some ground after being bombarded with particularly intense artillery fire last week. Russia's attack on the Donetsk city has been re-energised, amid greater cooperation between troops with Moscow's defence ministry and the Wagner mercenary group, the ministry said, citing UK intelligence. Ukrainian forces face significant resupply issues but have made orderly withdrawals from the positions they have been forced to concede, it added. Monday 17 April 2023 18:00 , William Mata Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will appeal on Tuesday against his arrest and detention in Moscow's most notorious former KGB prison on charges of espionage, according to court documents - Reuters has said. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 30 it had detained Gershkovich in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and had opened an espionage case against him for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military industrial complex. Gershkovich, the first American journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, and the Journal have denied he was involved in espionage, as has the United States. According to a public Russian judicial document, Lefortovo District",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-russia-war-live-putin-100148830.html,0,Vladimir Putin has visited military headquarters in Russia-controlled Kherson. Discussed the war with a general from Moscow's airborne troops. The general has reportedly taken up a powerful new role in the invasion. It comes as reports suggest French president Emmanuel Macron is working on a set of secret plans with China which could bring an end to Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Mr Macron has reportedly deployed his foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne to work in tandem with China's top diplomat Wang Yi.

Protesters clashed with police in the Greek capital Athens after a passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided with a freight train on Tuesday evening in Tempi, near the city of Larissa, leaving at least 46 people dead and scores injured. The death toll is expected to rise. The Greek transport minister resigned in the wake of the tragedy, while a rail workers union is going on strike, accusing the government of disrespect in the sector. Another 52 people remain in hospital as a result of the crash, which left toppled carriages and scorched debris in its wake. Six of the injured being treated are in critical condition due to head wounds and serious burns, state-owned public broadcaster ERT reported Thursday. Most of the passengers involved in the accident were young, a local hospital told ERT. The accident came soon after a holiday weekend. The identification process of the dead is ongoing alongside recovery efforts involving firefighters and ambulance workers, with the focus on the first carriages of the passenger train, Greek authorities said.

In an extraordinary meeting, the Greek federation of rail workers decided unanimously to launch the 24-hour strike on Thursday to highlight poor working conditions and chronic understaffing. It accused the federal government of disrespect towards railways for causing the tragic crash, saying more permanent staff, better training and mainly the implementation of modern security systems, are permanently thrown in the bin. Separately, another 24-hour strike was announced by Greek metro workers, who said in a statement: There are no words to describe such tragedy. Greek transport minister Kostas Karamanlis said the railway system the government inherited was not up to 21st century standards as he stepped down from his role Wednesday. In a televised address after visiting the crash site, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the collision was mainly due to tragic human error. He said the transport minister's decision to resign was honorable, and added that the heads of Hellenic Railways Organization and its subsidiary ERGOSE have also submitted their resignations.

The loudest and most disruptive sounds come from military sonar, oil exploration and industrial shipping. These sounds are proven to disorientate and harm marine mammals, fish, turtles, invertebrates and cephalopods, who all use sound to communicate, find their way and hunt. In Cartagena Port in southern Spain, maritime traffic is the primary source of continuous noise, and it is officially an 'underwater noise pollution area'. Part of this traffic also crosses a Special Area of Conservation spanning 154 082 hectares, an area around the size of London. 'We want to reduce the impact these sounds have on the marine environment both in the port and beyond it', says LIFE PortSounds project coordinator Javier Muoz Bozzo. Finding the sources of the noise Project partners are mapping and assessing the influence of marine traffic and the impact of the resulting underwater noise on biodiversity. In particular, the team is monitoring the abundance, distribution and physiological state of three six cetacean species: the bottlenose dolphin, pilot whale and striped dolphin. Around 200 cetaceans have already been observed; definitive results will come at the end of 2023. They are also developing a tool to recover data from specially placed hydrophones. This data will help them make predictive scenarios to identify the noise sources and introduce measures to deal with the vessels that may interfere with biodiversity. 'We will assess whether the proposed mitigation measures will improve the conservation status of the three species while boosting their populations and reproductive rates,' adds Mr Muoz Bozzo. Introducing a speed limit The project team is developing and implementing noise mitigation measures to benefit the species. For example, as a port authority, they can regulate the speed of vessels. To this end, they plan to cut the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) by up to 10 dB by reducing the average speed of large ships from 20 to 10 knots. This speed limit should lessen average continuous noise to levels that do not impact the three cetacean species. It is also expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions. A working group will regularly assess the mitigation measures and adapt as necessary. The project hopes to apply the project's mitigation measures and noise management tool to other port authorities.

An RDG spokesman said: The RMT leadership's decision to put Network Rail's deal to its membership is a welcome development, but train operating staff will rightly be asking why their union continues to deny them the opportunity to have their say on our equivalent offer. Instead of inflicting more lost pay on its members and disruption to our passengers, we are calling on the union to call off their strikes and meet us for urgent talks to resolve this dispute. The RDG said its offer includes pay rises of at least 5 for 2022 and 4 for this year, with a lump sum payment for last year's increase. The Government and the rail industry insist reforms to working practices are needed to afford higher salaries as the sector's finances have been badly affected by the drop in passengers caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Department for Transport (DfT) heavily influences the financial decisions of train companies after taking on their revenue risks due to the virus crisis. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said: We are relieved for our people, passengers and freight customers that industrial action in Network Rail has now been suspended. We look forward to further information on plans for a referendum. A DfT spokeswoman said: It is positive news that the RMT has finally put this offer to their members and have called off upcoming industrial action by Network Rail workers.

(Image: RailMinIndiaTwitter) The Ministry of Railways has answered a 'Did you know?' nugget about trains on Twitter today. For those wondering what the 'X' mark on the back of the train means, the Ministry has an explanation. Did you know? The letter 'X' on the last coach of the train denotes that the train has passed without any coaches being left behind, the ministry wrote with a photo of the sign on the train. The letter 'X' denotes that it is the train's last coach. Railway officials get a confirmation that a train has passed in its entirety without any coaches being left behind, the picture reads. Indian Railways is one of the largest railway networks in the world and is owned and operated by the government of India and was established in 1853 by the British colonial government. The first railway line in India was built between Mumbai (then Bombay) and Thane in 1853, covering a distance of 34 kilometers. This line was later extended to cover other parts of the country, and by the early 20th century, the Indian railway network had become the largest employer in the country. During the early days, the Indian Railways faced several challenges, including a lack of resources, technical expertise, and political opposition. However, the network continued to expand and improve, and by the 1940s, it had become a crucial part of India's transportation infrastructure. In the decades following independence, Indian Railways underwent significant modernization and expansion, with the introduction of new technologies, electrification of tracks, and the construction of new lines and stations. Today, Indian Railways is a major contributor to the country's economy, providing employment to millions of people and connecting various regions of India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/what-is-the-x-mark-on-the-back-of-a-train-ministry-of-railways-reveal-10206801.html,0,"The letter 'X' on the last coach of the train denotes that the train has passed without any coaches being left behind.

Under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) investment scheme, Beijing has invested billions of dollars in Pakistan since 2015. Despite continued threats from Pakistani militants, private companies have flocked to the border to undertake contracts for large-scale infrastructure initiatives. According to the police, a warehouse complex for the Dasu hydropower project in the Kohistan district of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, located 180 kilometers (110 miles) north of Islamabad, was destroyed in a pre-dawn blaze on Tuesday. It was a huge fire, stated a Rescue 1122 official who was present at the scene. Initially, the flames were very high and we had to call for fire brigade vehicles from two other districts. It was quite a big storehouse, and apart from oil drums, stationery and machinery were also stockpiled there. That is all been destroyed in the fire, he told AFP. The construction of the Dasu dam was assigned to China Gezhouba Group Company by Pakistan's water ministry in 2017. The camp was occupied by Chinese engineers, surveyors, and mechanics; however, neither police nor Rescue 1122 reported any casualties. An electrical malfunction is suspected to have triggered the fire, as per a police official's statement. Earlier in July 2021, a bus carrying employees to the Dasu site was bombed, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals, including nine Chinese laborers, with Beijing claiming it was an intentional attack. Islamabad initially attributed the explosion to a gas leak, but security measures at the location were significantly increased following the incident. Despite the close economic relations between China and Pakistan, the security of Chinese workers in Pakistan has been a persistent concern for Beijing, as militants who oppose foreign influence often target Chinese nationals. Following the Taliban's return to power in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan has witnessed a significant increase in militant attacks in its western regions, which coincidentally are the same areas where China is concentrating its investments.",https://www.gg2.net/chinese-dam-construction-camp-in-pakistan-catches-fire/,0,"A fire engulfed the camp of a Chinese company responsible for overseeing the construction of a remote hydropower dam in north-western Pakistan.

The FAA told The Hill that the pilot of a Learjet 60 took off without clearance at Boston's Logan International Airport at the same time that JetBlue Flight 206 was preparing to land on an intersecting runway, according to a preliminary review by the department. The agency said the incident occurred right before 7 p.m. on Monday, when an air traffic controller instructed the pilot of the Learjet to wait on the runway while the JetBlue jet landed on an intersecting runway. Instead, the pilot of the LearJet began a takeoff roll, causing the JetBlue airliner to take evasive action. The Learjet was operated by a private charter company, Hop-A-Jet, according to the FAA. The FAA will work to determine exactly how close the two jets came to each other. The incident in Boston follows a similar close call in Texas earlier this month -- an event that is also under investigation. A FedEx cargo plane in Austin nearly landed on a runway where a Southwest flight was preparing to take off. The FedEx plane pulled back up in time to avoid a collision.",https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3877695-faa-investigating-close-call-between-planes-at-boston-airport/,0,"The FAA is investigating a close call between two jets on Monday night at a Boston airport.

They are describing the rescue as a frantic effort involving no less than three ships which had responded to a mayday call. At 0100 local time, the MRCC Cape Town received a radio call from the crew of the fishing vessel Olivia Marie reporting that their 105-foot ship was on fire. The vessel registered in South Africa shows according to its AIS data that it had departed Hout Bay, south of Cape Town, on April 5. The MRCC reports that the crew said they were abandoning ship after the fire had begun in the engine room and that the whole vessel was now ablaze. The fire was said to be spreading quickly. The crew was getting into a small life raft despite strong winds and high seas and urgently requesting assistance. Several vessels were in the area and the MRCC coordinated with them to organize the rescue. A Liberian registered bulk carrier, AquaExplore (179,000 dwt) was inbound toward St. Helena Bay Anchorage and diverted. She was the first on the scene but SAMSA reports the vessel was unable to recover the fishing boat crew from the raft. The bulker however remained on-scene. Next to arrive was a smaller fishing boat, the 62-foot Umfondini, also registered in South Africa and operating out of neighboring Gordons Bay. The vessel was able to rescue the crewmembers from their raft. It left the raft and burning fishing boat heading for shore with the crew. All crew were safely transferred to the Umfondini with the prevailing winds reported to be South-westerly at 15 knots and a water swell of up to 2.6 meters (approximately 8.5 feet). The AquaExplore proceeded with its normal voyage, with the bulker arriving at its destination later in the day reports SAMSA. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), a volunteer lifesaving organization, also put a boat out to assist with the effort. The rescue boat was able to rendezvous with the fishing vessel with the crew from the burning ship. They transferred the crew to the NSRI Simon's Town craft. The rescue boat brought the crew back to their station and arranged for them to be transported back to Hout Bay. SAMSA is also issuing a navigation warning asking vessels in the area both to proceed with caution and to also report any sightings of the drifting fishing boat and its life raft. A third fishing boat, Langenberg, spotted the wreck of the Olivia Marie seen drifting approximately 3.5 nautical miles from its original position with the force 5 winds pushing the wreck toward shallow waters. SAMSA is also warning that some debris has been spotted in the water along with the drifting life raft. They are requesting assistance in the recovery of the Olivia Marie and its lift raft.
