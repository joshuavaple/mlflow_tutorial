He was held after allegedly touching his bottom and nipples ""in a lewd way"" during the flight. He is said to have got up from his seat and approached the flight attendant in an ""affectionate way"" before touching him. Other passengers helped restrain him until the plane landed in Majorca.

Police were waiting for the man, believed to be 43 years old, and took him away in handcuffs after radioing for reinforcements after he allegedly became aggressive towards the first officers to arrive. The detainee, who was wearing a white pair of shorts and a T-shirt as well as matching white sandals with black socks when he was arrested, has not been named.

The bizarre incident occurred Friday and the suspect was taken to court in the Majorcan capital today for a hearing which took place behind closed doors. Respected local newspaper Ultima Hora reported he initially told the investigating judge he had wanted to play a joke on the air steward but subsequently offered conflicting versions of why he had acted the way he had which were ""incoherent.""

He was released on bail pending an ongoing investigation. It was not immediately clear today if he has been banned from leaving Majorca and had his passport taken away or is free to leave the island while he continues to be probed on suspicion of sexual assault and resisting arrest. The airline operating the flight has not been named.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Majorca said: ""I can confirm the arrest of a British man yesterday at Palma Airport on suspicion of sexual assault. He allegedly sexually assaulted a flight attendant on a plane from Newcastle to Palma.""

Last month a British holidaymaker was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting an air stewardess before spitting on her boss on a Jet2 flight from Manchester to Ibiza. The 42-year-old was held by police after reaching the island. Jet2 confirmed after the arrest it had banned him from flying with them. As well as prosecution the tourist was also warned he faced a heavy fine.

Overnight it emerged four men on an easyJet plane from Manchester to Tenerife had been hauled off an aircraft yesterday after it had to be diverted to Lanzarote. Spanish air traffic controllers said the reroute occurred because of violent passengers on board.

And in another incident yesterday two British women described as ""drunk"" were met by police around 1.30pm as a second easyJet plane coming from Luton landed in Fuerteventura.

""We are hopeful that if the community really utilizes this service, JetBlue would consider expanding it,"" said Harrington, noting that some level of service is expected to begin in November before the daily service begins.

JetBlue suspended the nonstop route between West Palm Beach and LAX in April 2022 after nearly 18 months of service four times a week. JetBlue officials attributed the cutback to the high price of fuel at that time.

ALSO AT PBIA: Delta to add winter flights from PBI to Westchester, N.Y.; service starts in November

Aviation consultant Jeff Miller said then that such moves are part of the business, adding they are a tool to ensure the profitability of the airline. Flights with one stop are currently available at PBIA, but they can take more than 10 hours, making them impracticable for many travelers.

Air traffic throughout the country has surged since the lows in 2020 when COVID-19 affected air travel.

PBIA is experiencing record passenger volume, according to Laura Beebe, director of airports. In July, 539,873 passengers flew out of the airport, a 17% increase over the same month in 2022. The year-to-date figure was 7.4 million, an increase of 15%.

Jeremy Smith, a professor of transportation and logistics at Keiser University, said it is clear that fear of catching COVID on airplanes has eased, resulting in a significant increase in travelers vacationing throughout the country but particularly in South Florida.

""Consumers had been very afraid to fly,"" he noted. ""That is no longer the case.""

IN FORT LAUDERDALE: New low-cost nonstop flights coming to FLL: Canadians, UF students to benefit

More than 1 million passengers used JetBlue from January through July, accounting for 28% of PBIA's volume, making it the No. 1 carrier. In addition to the new JetBlue service, other seasonal flights returning to the airport include service to Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston and Washington-Dulles International Airport.

PBIA reported that J.D. Power has ranked it as the nation's fourth-best medium-sized airport. ""We are honored and thrilled to be recognized by J.D. Power,"" Beebe said. ""This placement underscores our commitment to a world-class, stress-free customer experience.""

IN FORT LAUDERDALE: Expanded seasonal service coming to FLL; flights to Ronald Reagan added

J.D. Power examined food and beverage options at the airport as well as baggage claim and terminal facilities, among other factors. PBIA is currently adding more restaurant and retail space as part of a Concourse B expansion.

The project will also result in two new passenger jet bridges, expanded restrooms, adult changing areas, a sensory area for those with sensitivities and dedicated nursing stations.

This comes just weeks after some passenger screening times approached two hours at New Zealand's busiest international arrivals hall, on September 17.

Arriving at the New Zealand border, there are many checks and factors that can stack up to a substantial waiting time.

With customs and biosecurity screening requirements to clear -- on top of waiting for checked luggage to be processed and delivered to the arrivals hall -- the airport is trialling ways to ease congestion at Auckland's many layers of border screening.

Now it is hoped a biosecurity Express Lane path might allow some travellers with ""nothing to declare"" to cruise through required checks and, hopefully, speed up the process for all arrivals.

Since September 22, 6286 passengers have been processed under the trial.

Northern regional commissioner for the Ministry for Primary Industries, Mike Inglis, said the trial was already having an effect on wait times during the busy school holiday period.

Open to New Zealand passengers identified as ""low risk"" in terms of biosecurity, Inglis says it is among measures that have already contributed to lowering processing times. Nearly 40 per cent of arrivals to Auckland are now eligible to pass through the Express Lanes.

""Biosecurity processing has been working well at international airports for arriving passengers over the holidays. The average biosecurity processing time, from entering the biosecurity lane to exiting risk assessment, has been close to nine minutes during the holiday period,"" says Inglis.

This is down from an average of 13 minutes and 16 seconds in February.

Some international arrivals, invited to take part in the trial, without checked luggage told the Herald they were able to pass through the terminal from plane to arrivals hall in 10 minutes, saying it was a ""great improvement"" on last month.

Inglis says the Express Lane is still subject to checks by detector dogs, which have found undeclared fruit and sandwiches among the trial arrivals.

""We remind travellers that they should do the right thing and declare any risk items to avoid fines and delays,"" he says.

However, while biosecurity screening has been streamlined by the new Express Lane queue, Customs wait times have slowly been creeping up.

In some cases passengers are already unacceptably delayed before they even reach biosecurity screening.

New Zealand Customs service standards aim for a maximum of 45 minutes for processing passengers from landing through to passport controls. However, there have been points in the past year where multiple arrivals, passenger declarations and bottlenecks of services have led to processing exceeding this.

At three points in the past fortnight, arrivals met or or exceeded the maximum wait time before they had even cleared passport control.

Disruption during the week of September 11 meant average wait times approached 44.3 minutes for 90 per cent of passengers.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) gives 45 minutes as the maximum wait for normal customs inspection.

The optimal, expected processing time is just 20 minutes.

A spokesperson for Auckland Airport says the New Zealand arrivals process is a complex one with many moving parts.

""The arrivals process is made up of a chain of organisations operating together in a system -- airlines, ground handlers, Customs, Biosecurity New Zealand and Auckland Airport,"" they said.

Overall the new trials to streamline screening, including the biosecurity Express Lane, had led to faster processing during school holidays.

The median time for the arrivals process for the first week of the school holiday was 10 per cent faster than for the previous six months.

""Everyone has been collectively pulling out all the stops to ensure travellers have a smooth experience over the busy school holiday period,"" saying that the Biosecurity Express Lane had ""shown early signs of success"".

It is hoped the trial might be in place for a busy expected summer travel period ahead and be rolled out to other international airport arrivals.","{'uri': 'nzherald.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NZ Herald', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 201857, 'alexaGlobalRank': 4357, 'alexaCountryRank': 9}}","[{'uri': 'thomas_bywater@nzherald.co.nz', 'name': 'Thomas Bywater', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/2LqzrYKRVe2yb2hzvTNAAnu10VI=/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/AU22RPJKPZF4VORYBNZOBVQ24A.JPG,None,0.11372549,66,66,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,auckland airport trials screening express lane to cut down unacceptable wait times   nz herald,air,0,"Auckland Airport trials screening Express Lane to cut down unacceptable wait times - NZ HeraldJust over 6000 passengers at Auckland's international arrivals have been invited to trial a new Express Lane, aimed at cutting down unacceptable wait times at the border.

""We're always evaluating our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our customers. After careful consideration, we have decided to close our Amazon Air operation at Leipzig/Halle Airport and affected employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other facilities,"" an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) spokesperson said in an emailed statement, confirming news first reported by industry website ch-aviation.

The hub was handling several flights per week operated by contractor ASL Airlines Ireland using Boeing 737-800 converted freighters, according to Amazon officials and aviation databases. ASL Airlines Ireland operates nine 737-800s in Europe under the Amazon livery.

Amazon will continue to use Leipzig/Halle as a delivery station for customers in the Saxony region, but the airport won't be used as a collection point for connecting other cities in Europe, the company said.

Amazon began operating to Leipzig/Halle airport, where it leased a 20,000-square-foot facility, in November 2020 with two freighters to speed package delivery for Prime members around the continent. The company said service will not be impacted by the hub's closure.

The online retail giant has invested in expanding its European logistics network in recent years, including a fulfillment center outside Bremen, Germany, that opened in August. It plans to open an additional fulfillment center and a sortation center in Germany over the next three years.

Amazon Air has also made changes to routes and flight frequencies in Europe to reduce overhead in line with a slowdown in e-commerce sales. ASL Aviation Holdings released 28 pilots in July after Amazon reduced flight requirements in Europe.

The Chaddick Institute at DePaul University researches Amazon Air and estimated in March that ASL Airlines Ireland operates 22 flights per day on its behalf, not including auxiliary flights in nonbranded planes.

Amazon, which relies entirely on partner airlines, is not alone in dialing back flight activity amid a lengthy freight transport recession. DHL Express, FedEx and UPS have all trimmed the number of flights on certain routes and outsourced airlift. The U.S. logistics integrators have also parked dozens of aircraft and accelerated the retirement of older aircraft types, with FedEx also closing some pilot and maintenance bases.

The adjustments within Amazon's air logistics network are modest compared to FedEx and UPS. Growth in Amazon Air activity has slowed considerably this year after the e-commerce surge during the pandemic. That contrasts with FedEx and UPS, which have cut flight hours. In August, Amazon's domestic U.S. fleet took to the skies 3% more than the prior year following a 16% year-over-year gain in July. FedEx domestic flight activity was 7% lower in August than the prior year and 14% lower in July. UPS flight activity in the U.S. was 13.5% below 2022 levels for July and August.

Leipzig/Halle is Germany's second-largest cargo airport.

Following the news of the second leg of HS2 being scrapped on Wednesday (October 4) the government has instead announced the launch of 'Network North', with investments dubbed to improve transport and connectivity across the north of England.

In the north west, it was announced that almost £4bn in cash would be found to 'improve connectivity', including a scheme to extend the Manchester Metrolink lines to Heywood, Bolton and Wigan.

However, the government also announced that the Metrolink would be extended to Manchester Airport as a trade-off for the scrapping of HS2 - despite the fact the line already exists and was opened in November 2014.

The announcement read: ""Nearly £4 billion to improve connectivity, which could pay for schemes such as the extension of the Manchester Metrolink to Heywood, Bolton, Wigan and Manchester Airport and bus rapid transit corridors in Manchester.""

The north was also promised over £3bn in 'long term road resurfacing' to fix potholes and more than £500 million towards two major road schemes around Manchester, including a new link road between the M62 and the M60.

Following the news of the second leg of HS2 being scrapped on Wednesday (October 4) the government has instead announced the launch of 'Network North', with investments dubbed to improve transport and connectivity across the north of England.

In the north west, it was announced that almost £4bn in cash would be found to 'improve connectivity', including a scheme to extend the Manchester Metrolink lines to Heywood, Bolton and Wigan.

However, the government also announced that the Metrolink would be extended to Manchester Airport as a trade-off for the scrapping of HS2 - despite the fact the line already exists and was opened in November 2014.

The announcement read: ""Nearly £4 billion to improve connectivity, which could pay for schemes such as the extension of the Manchester Metrolink to Heywood, Bolton, Wigan and Manchester Airport and bus rapid transit corridors in Manchester.""

The north was also promised over £3bn in 'long term road resurfacing' to fix potholes and more than £500 million towards two major road schemes around Manchester, including a new link road between the M62 and the M60.

A high-level meeting to take stock of safety measures at the airport was held on Wednesday.

According to airport officials, the project, funded under the central government's Udan scheme, is estimated to be at Rs 65 crore.

The review meeting focused on the security arrangements for the impending airport, said officials.

Airport officials said that the review meeting led by Deputy General Security Manager Vijayakumar and officials from the Vellore District Police undertook the inspection which covered various critical areas including the terminal, passenger arrival and departure zones, runway, lanes, and security gates.

Given the importance of state police in providing security for such small airports, authorities engaged in a joint consultation to determine the required personnel for safeguarding the airport premises, said officials.

Earlier this week, the airport officials had informed that the preliminary signal testing for take-off and landing has been successfully completed at Vellore Airport and steps are being taken to start flight services soon.

In this regard, a preliminary test was done on Sunday to see if the lights specially set up near the runway are visible during the day and if the signal is received from the information control room and the signal tower, the officials added.

The officials further said that the first phase of the test flight conducted at the Abdullapuram airport with respect to signal and lights has been successfully completed.

The next step is to land the aircraft on the runway and test it. We have applied for permission to operate the aircraft, they added. They said that the permission will be granted soon and the flight services from here will start soon.

The officials further said that a test aircraft belonging to the Air Transport Commission was flown from New Delhi to Vellore via Chennai as part of the preliminary testing.

The aircraft was tested by low-flying five times near the Abdullapuram airstrip. It was inspected by three persons, including a pilot from the Aircraft Inspection Unit in New Delhi, the officials said.

An ambulance and a fire engine were also kept ready near the airport runway as a precautionary safety measure.

The renovation work of the airport at Abdullapuram next to Vellore has been underway since 2017 under the central government's Udan project.

Small planes that can carry about 19 passengers will operate from here to Chennai, Bengaluru, Tirupati and other cities. An 850-meter-long runway has been constructed for it.

The works including the airport terminal, cargo terminal, information control room, radar equipment, signal tower, station office, and passenger waiting room renovation works have been completed so far.

The review meeting focused on the security arrangements for the impending airport, said officials.

Airport officials said that the review meeting led by Deputy General Security Manager Vijayakumar and officials from the Vellore District Police undertook the inspection which covered various critical areas including the terminal, passenger arrival and departure zones, runway, lanes, and security gates.

Given the importance of state police in providing security for such small airports, authorities engaged in a joint consultation to determine the required personnel for safeguarding the airport premises, said officials.

Earlier this week, the airport officials had informed that the preliminary signal testing for take-off and landing has been successfully completed at Vellore Airport and steps are being taken to start flight services soon.

In this regard, a preliminary test was done on Sunday to see if the lights specially set up near the runway are visible during the day and if the signal is received from the information control room and the signal tower, the officials added.

The officials further said that the first phase of the test flight conducted at the Abdullapuram airport with respect to signal and lights has been successfully completed.

The next step is to land the aircraft on the runway and test it. We have applied for permission to operate the aircraft, they added. They said that the permission will be granted soon and the flight services from here will start soon.

The officials further said that a test aircraft belonging to the Air Transport Commission was flown from New Delhi to Vellore via Chennai as part of the preliminary testing.

The aircraft was tested by low-flying five times near the Abdullapuram airstrip. It was inspected by three persons, including a pilot from the Aircraft Inspection Unit in New Delhi, the officials said.

An ambulance and a fire engine were also kept ready near the airport runway as a precautionary safety measure.

The renovation work of the airport at Abdullapuram next to Vellore has been underway since 2017 under the central government's Udan project.

The public is still being urged not to go to the airport until the terminal has been opened and the police cordon is removed.

The airport said it was advised by the defence force explosive ordnance unit that it was safe to reopen.

Earlier, passengers had to be evacuated and incoming aircraft diverted as authorities dealt with the alert.

The airport said it activated its emergency security protocols shortly after 8.30am and emergency services were called.

Queenstown Airport said flights would be delayed and it was arranging food and shelter for passengers who required it.

Air New Zealand said it had cancelled 10 flights as a result of the situation - four inbound and six outbound.

""We apologise to our passengers for the disruption, especially as this has happened at the end of the busy school holidays period. Safety is our number one priority and we are working with the relevant authorities,"" Air New Zealand said in a statement.

A police cordon is in place and the public cannot access airport car parks A and B or the terminal at present.

Updates on flight details will be issued by the airlines and by Queenstown Airport through their Facebook page.

While some passengers have gone home or to their accommodation, about 250 people have moved to the Queenstown Events Centre, where food, drinks and activities have been provided.

One of the passengers caught up in the disruption, Geoff, said he was supposed to be flying to Sydney early Friday afternoon.

""I've checked Qantas there's nothing happening there yet, but I've checked with some friends and they're saying something about a bomb, that's all I know so I presume what they'll do is clear the airport, just depends how long it's going to take for that to happen.""

Geoff said he was relaxed about his flight possibly being delayed as he had somewhere to stay, but he felt sorry for those who were trying to leave and had flights to make or nowhere to stay.

Himanshu and Jahnavi were due to fly to Wellington but missed their 10.15am flight due to the disruption.

HImanshu said the airport was already in the process of being evacuated when they arrived there at 9.30am.

His wife, Jahnavi, said they were told they had to park elsewhere when they first arrived and then when they walked back, they could not enter the terminal and people were milling around.

""We were asking everyone 'what's happening', 'how long do we have to wait'.""

Adrian Stephen-Feod was at the airport to pick up some cars to take back to Christchurch and said there would be a lot of disrupted people and flights since it was the end of the school holidays.

""We got information on our way down at about 8.45am that the evacuation had taken place, and we arrived here at 10am to find all these people milling around, and this is as far as we've got at the roundabout, we've been turned back so we can't get any further.""","{'uri': 'rnz.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'RNZ', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 284619, 'alexaGlobalRank': 24836, 'alexaCountryRank': 43}}",[],https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--iwbvLI07--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1696540187/4L1KIJP_MicrosoftTeams_image_59_png,eng-8952683,0.098039216,86,86,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,queenstown airport cleared to reopen after alert,air,1,"Queenstown Airport cleared to reopen after alertQueenstown Airport has been given the all clear to reopen after an earlier security scare.

The airport has requested that passengers and members of the public stay away from the airport until it had been given clearance to reopen.

Queenstown Airport said flights would be delayed and it was arranging food and shelter for passengers who required it.

Air New Zealand said so far it had cancelled 10 flights as a result of the situation - four inbound and six outbound.

""We apologise to our passengers for the disruption, especially as this has happened at the end of the busy school holidays period. Safety is our number one priority and we are working with the relevant authorities,"" Air New Zealand said in a statement.

All passengers due to depart on Friday or picking up passengers from incoming flights are asked not to come to the airport until told otherwise.

A police cordon is in place and the public cannot access airport car parks A and B or the terminal at present.

Updates on flight details will be issued by the airlines and by Queenstown Airport through their Facebook page.

While some passengers have gone home or to their accommodation, about 250 people have moved to the Queenstown Events Centre, where food, drinks and activities have been provided.

One of the passengers caught up in the disruption, Geoff, said he was supposed to be flying to Sydney early Friday afternoon.

""I've checked Qantas there's nothing happening there yet, but I've checked with some friends and they're saying something about a bomb, that's all I know so I presume what they'll do is clear the airport, just depends how long it's going to take for that to happen.""

Geoff said he was relaxed about his flight possibly being delayed as he had somewhere to stay, but he felt sorry for those who were trying to leave and had flights to make or nowhere to stay.

Himanshu and Jahnavi were due to fly to Wellington but missed their 10.15am flight due to the disruption.

HImanshu said the airport was already in the process of being evacuated when they arrived there at 9.30am.

His wife, Jahnavi, said they were told they had to park elsewhere when they first arrived and then when they walked back, they could not enter the terminal and people were milling around.

""We were asking everyone 'what's happening', 'how long do we have to wait'.""

Adrian Stephen-Feod was at the airport to pick up some cars to take back to Christchurch and said there would be a lot of disrupted people and flights since it was the end of the school holidays.

A ski boot warmer stored in luggage sparked a bomb scare at Queenstown Airport that prompted an evacuation and emergency response on Friday morning.

Airport chief executive Glen Sowry said the electrical device was spotted during screening of checked luggage about 8.40am.

It sat under other dense material inside a bag alongside a computer and had wires hanging from it.

""Aviation Security staff had a close inspection and determined that it was a serious concern,"" he said.

Police examined the image and contacted the New Zealand Defence Force, which also believed the object was suspicious and flew its Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit to the airport by helicopter from Christchurch.

The unit deemed the ""reported items posed no threat"", and the airport reopened at 3pm.

Throughout the day, about 25 flights were disrupted or cancelled.

Sowry said airlines were scheduling extra domestic and international flights over the weekend to get people to their destinations.

""I think it will take most of the weekend to be able to work through this,"" he said.

About 250 passengers were taken by bus to the Queenstown Events Centre, near the airport, and were provided with food, drinks and activities until the airport reopened.

Queenstown Airport thanked members of the public for their patience and understanding.

The police cordon had been lifted and passengers were free to collect luggage and vehicles, while those with a confirmed flight reservation were also requested to come to the airport.

""If you have been impacted and do not have a confirmed booking, please contact your airline,"" was the authorities advice.

The airport had been evacuated, and its emergency security protocols activated, with passengers taken by bus to a secure location earlier on Friday.

At 11am, Queenstown Airport said it would ""likely take several hours"" while authorities worked through the risk assessment process.

Food and shelter had been arranged for passengers who required it at the Queenstown Event Centre.

Queenstown Lakes District mayor Glyn Lewers said the the event centre had accommodated ""approximately 200 passengers that were evacuated"".

Lewers said about 11.30am they were waiting for the Defence Force to arrive from Christchurch.

Police advised people to avoid the airport and there were no flights in or out of Queenstown during the incident.

Further updates on flight details were to be provided on the Queenstown Airport Facebook page.

Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said due to the incident, four inbound flights had been cancelled, and one flight had returned to Christchurch.

Six outbound flights from Queenstown had also been cancelled. They were flights to Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

""We apologise to our passengers for the disruption, especially as this has happened at the end of the busy school holidays period. Safety is our number one priority, and we are working with the relevant authorities,"" Morgan said.

A Jetstar spokesperson said two flights have been affected by the incident so far.

Wānaka resident Hayley Barbour said her mother-in-law, also from Wānaka, had her flight cancelled and was waiting in the rain with other passengers in one of the airport's car parks, about 10.30am, as they were being moved by bus to the event centre.

Barbour said they had been advised that the delays would be a ""few hours"".

Louella, her mother-in-law, was catching a flight on her way to her great-niece's wedding tomorrow, and had caught an early bus from Wānaka to the airport, to make sure she was on time.

But one hour later, Barbour said Air New Zealand had been ""amazing"" and Louella was booked on another flight tomorrow morning to get to the wedding.

It was a shame that the family had got more information from Facebook than the airport had given to passengers waiting outside, she said.

A person who walked past the airport said police were everywhere.

Tom Clarke and Luisa Navanteri, a couple from Sydney, were waiting at the airport for a flight that was supposed to leave at 2.25pm and had been pushed back to 3.30pm.

They had been in Queenstown for a week on holiday and said they presumed that the flight was still going ahead.

When they arrived at the airport, they were told nothing and said security was just as much in the dark.

""We've just been waiting here,"" Navanteri said.

They had heard there was a bomb threat but were waiting around to see if there would be an update.

Clarke said it was ""a little bit"" frustrating but ""it is just one of those things"".

NZ 'dark pop' singer and songwriter Michele Ducray was supposed to be on her way up to Auckland to promote the release of her new EP Throne of Mine when she was moved away from the airport by security.

""When I was walking up to the airport, security just started rushing everyone out and mass crowds started forming,"" Ducray said.

She was told to go to the field by the 'welcome to the airport' sign and confirmed security were in the dark about the situation as well.

It wasn't until everybody went online that they found out it was a bomb threat, she said.

Ducray said everybody felt confused and ""inconvenienced"".

The singer's radio interview with The Edge will now go ahead tonight via Zoom and she has had to reschedule her Auckland show at the 13th Floor.","{'uri': 'stuff.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Stuff', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 201732, 'alexaGlobalRank': 4332, 'alexaCountryRank': 10}}",[],https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/z/7/4/y/i/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.4z74t4.png/1696570783355.jpg,eng-8952683,-0.184313726,66,66,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,ski boot warmer sparked queenstown airport bomb scare,air,1,"Ski boot warmer sparked Queenstown Airport bomb scarePeople head back towards Queenstown Airport after hours of waiting for investigations into a bomb threat.

""We can say the third terminal is the first milestone to realise Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's dream to make Bangladesh an aviation hub,"" Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (Caab) chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman told BSS today.

He said the PM will partially open the new scenic terminal witnessing the trial of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight from the new establishment.

The Caab chairman said 90 percent work of the new terminal has been done for the soft launching, and from Saturday airlines would be able to use the new parking bay of the terminal.

The third terminal will be fully operational for use by passengers at the end of next year after completion of systems integration and calibration.

""The new terminal will change the country's image with all world-class amenities and passenger services,"" said the Caab chief.

He said the third terminal's features, with immaculate floor and eye-catching patterns on ceiling and sufficient natural light, are very sophisticated.

""Passengers will appreciate the world-class facilities of the new terminal which we never had here before,"" he added.

The 12 boarding gates with double entry bridges will be operational by next year while an additional 14 boarding bridges are expected to be installed afterwards.

The third terminal project, costing Tk 21,300 crore, commenced on December 28, 2019. The government contributed Tk 5,000 crore, while the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided the remaining funds.

Covering an area of 5,42,000 square metres, the third terminal will boast a floor space of 2,30,000 square metres, housing 115 check-in counters, 66 departure immigration desks, 59 arrival immigration and 3 VIP immigration desks.

Upon full-fledged operation of the terminal, Dhaka airport's annual passenger and cargo handling capacity is expected to double.

The annual passenger handling capacity of the HSIA would be 24 million (including the old terminals) which is now only eight million and the airport can handle 5,00,000 tonnes of cargo each year.

The construction work of 37 new aircraft parking areas and two taxiways connecting to the apron area have already been completed.

The third terminal is designed to connect with a multimodal transport system to enable passengers to enter and exit the international airport smoothly.

The new terminal will be connected with the elevated expressway, underground railway (MRT-5, Kamalapur to airport portion) and also with the airport railway station through an underground tunnel.

It is expected to be operated and maintained by a Japanese company under public-private partnership.

Ahead of the third terminal's full operation, different foreign airlines are eyeing to start their operation from Dhaka Airport, which is expected to play a great role to take the country's aviation sector forward, experts said.","{'uri': 'thedailystar.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Star', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 209602, 'alexaGlobalRank': 5306, 'alexaCountryRank': 33}}",[],https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2023/10/06/dhaka_airpott_0.jpg?itok=FDPWQQYo,eng-8953893,0.247058824,56,56,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,soft opening of dhaka airport s third terminal tomorrow,air,0,"Soft opening of Dhaka airport's third terminal tomorrowPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina will soft launch the much anticipated third terminal of the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) tomorrow with a slogan of ""connecting dreams to reality"" for making Bangladesh an aviation hub.

The incident began about five hours into the Sept. 30 EVA Air flight when the couple started to argue loudly - allegedly about money.

In a statement by EVA Air to USA TODAY, the cause behind the disruption was because of seating.

""After five hours of flight time, a female passenger moved her seat from Economy Class to Premium Economy Class and refused to pay for the upgrade cost,"" the airline said. ""Another male passenger traveling with her also engaged in disorderly behavior and smoked an e-cigarette adjacent to the cabin galley.""

More: Not-so-friendly skies: Incidents of unruly passengers are rising

Flight attendants and other passengers tried to de-escalate the fight but ended up experiencing ""inappropriate insults and physical abuse.""

""Due to the continuation of their restless and disorderly behaviour, the captain decided to divert the flight for the well-being of all the passengers and cabin crew,"" EVA Air said.

Upon being escorted off the plane by police, the woman hurled $6,000 in cash at the man on the tarmac, according to SWSYMoney.

Some of the cash flew away, and airport workers tried to gather the rest.

In Vienna, the rest of the passengers were put up in a hotel for the evening to fly out the next day.

Multiple flights were cancelled and people were taken to Queenstown Events Centre before the New Zealand Defence Force bomb squad arrived.

Queenstown Airport chief executive Glen Sowry said a ""potential security threat item"" was detected by Aviation Security during routine baggage screening at the airport.

He said aviation security flagged an electronic device as a possible threat when it was spotted during bag screening.

Sowry said the device was packed next to a computer inside the bag and it looked ""highly suspicious and risky"".

It turned out to be a device used for heating boots.

The Aviation Security Service escalated this issue, which led to an evacuation of the Queenstown Airport terminal, and the airport was closed from 8.40am to 3pm yesterday.

About 250 passengers were transported by bus to the Queenstown Events Centre, near the airport, and were provided with food, drinks and activities until the airport reopened.

Sowry said it was ""a challenging day"" with the flight cancellations, and backlogs were likely to continue for the next three days.

""The good thing is that a number of airlines are putting on extra flights over the next couple of days, both domestically and across the Tasman, doing all they can to get their passengers to their destinations as quickly as possible,"" Sowry said.

He said affected travellers who faced delays or cancellations should contact their airlines.

""We know that the airlines are doing everything they can to re-accommodate people and to [put them on flights].

""The best option is just to get in touch with them,"" Sowry said.

Passengers were ushered off a grounded plane and people were evacuated from the airport buildings as emergency services responded to the threat, which was reported about 8.40am.

The passengers disembarked from the Star Alliance plane and walked across the tarmac to the far carpark at the airport, where police were stationed outside the main terminal.

A police spokesman said they received a report ""of what appears to be an explosive device"", and the terminal was evacuated as a safety precaution.

Musician Michele Ducray, who was due to fly from Queenstown to Auckland for a show and radio interview, said the atmosphere at the airport was crazy.

""It's been absolutely insane,"" Ducray told the Otago Daily Times yesterday afternoon.

""We heard over the intercom that flights were being cancelled and it was going to be closed for a while.

""Everyone was all over the place, these people in security vests were ushering people out.

Ducray said it was not until she checked online that she discovered it was a bomb threat.

""We got a message that it was due to a security incident; it was really confusing.""

She has had to reschedule her flights and show to Wednesday.

The New Zealand Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit arrived at the airport to assess and respond to a report of what appeared to be an explosive device, Sowry said.

A controlled investigation of the baggage was conducted by the unit, which determined the reported item posed no threat.

Throughout the course of the day, 25 flights were disrupted or cancelled, until an Air New Zealand flight from Sydney landed about 3.15pm.

An airport spokesman said food and shelter was arranged for passengers who needed it.

Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said the airline apologised for the disruption to passengers.

""Especially as this has happened at the end of the busy school holidays period.

""Safety is our No 1 priority and we are working with relevant authorities.""

Sowry thanked the entire airport team who responded for their professionalism and collaboration.

""I'd also like to thank the many passengers today whose travel was disrupted, for their patience and co-operation,"" he said.

Destination Queenstown chief executive Mat Woods said although yesterday's events had been an inconvenience, the regional tourism organisation was grateful authorities acted so swiftly, and it was delighted to have the airport reopened and people travelling again.

""We don't believe this will have an ongoing impact on Queenstown's brand and reputation,"" Woods said.","{'uri': 'nzherald.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NZ Herald', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 201857, 'alexaGlobalRank': 4357, 'alexaCountryRank': 9}}",[],https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/eUVAJ-_5eZhAl8YD53oxO6uPzCg=/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/UBDI3624GJCMHGARWWESZ7ZFFM.jpeg,eng-8952683,-0.066666667,66,66,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,revealed  surprising item behind bomb scare at queenstown airport,air,1,"Revealed: Surprising item behind bomb scare at Queenstown AirportA bomb threat sparked evacuations and lockdowns at Queenstown Airport yesterday -- but it turned out to be over a device for heating ski boots.

Multiple flights were cancelled and people were taken to Queenstown Events Centre before the New Zealand Defence Force bomb squad arrived.

Queenstown Airport chief executive Glen Sowry said a ""potential security threat item"" was detected by Aviation Security during routine baggage screening at the airport.

He said aviation security flagged an electronic device as a possible threat when it was spotted during bag screening.

Sowry said the device was packed next to a computer inside the bag and it looked ""highly suspicious and risky"".

Before the inauguration, the prime minister walked around the terminal and observed the facilities. She also talked to the airport staffers.

State Minister for Civil Aviation M Mahbub Ali accompanied the prime minister.

Later, she addressed a programme where Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, Dhaka south and north city corporation Mayors Sheikh Falze Noor Taposh and Atiqul Islam and Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) Chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman, among others, were present.

The four-year construction work of the magnificent third terminal of Dhaka airport was wrapped up yesterday.

From today, 10 to 12 planes will be able to park at the new apron, and travellers will be able to use the third terminal by the end of next year, said Abdul Malek, chief engineer at CAAB.

Around 6,000 employees and officials will be needed to run the third terminal.

""Around 10 percent of the work remains to be done. Integration, calibration, and testing of the equipment will start after the soft launch to make the third terminal building fully operational,"" Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh told The Daily Star.

The third terminal project, costing Tk 21,300 crore, commenced on December 28, 2019. The government contributed Taka 5,000 crore, while the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided the remaining funding, according to BSS report.

Covering an area of 542,000 square metres, the third terminal will boast a floor space of 230,000 square metres, housing 115 check-in counters, 66 departure immigration desks, 59 arrival immigration and 3 VIP immigration desks.

Upon full-fledged operation of the 3rd terminal, Dhaka Airport's annual passenger and cargo handling capacity is expected to double.

The annual passenger handling capacity of the HSIA would be 24 million (including the old terminals) which is now only eight million and the airport can handle 500,000 tonnes of cargo each year.

The construction work of 37 new aircraft parking area and two taxiways connecting to the apron area have already been completed.

The third terminal is designed to connect with a multimodal transport system to enable passengers to enter and exit the international airport smoothly.

The new terminal will be connected with the elevated expressway, underground railway (MRT-5, Kamalapur to airport portion) and also with the airport railway station through an underground tunnel.

Besides, hajj pilgrims will be able to access the third terminal from Ashkona hajj camp through an underground tunnel.

The third terminal is expected to be operated and maintained by a Japanese company under public private partnership.

Ahead of the third terminal's full operation, different foreign airlines are eyeing to start their operation from Dhaka Airport, which is expected to play a great role to take the country's aviation sector forward, experts said.","{'uri': 'thedailystar.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Star', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 209602, 'alexaGlobalRank': 5306, 'alexaCountryRank': 33}}",[],https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2023/10/07/3rd_terminal_bss.jpg?itok=nD6OhSEs,eng-8953893,0.11372549,56,56,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,dhaka airport  pm opens iconic third terminal,air,0,"Dhaka airport: PM opens iconic third terminalPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina opened the iconic third terminal partially today with the slogan ""connecting dreams to reality"".

Last month, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) decided to construct a 'state-of-the-art' air traffic control (ATC) tower at Jinnah International Airport, Karachi.

During a board meeting convened in Karachi, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) approved crucial decisions geared towards improving airport infrastructure and safety measures.

The authority decided to construct a world-class Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower and a Rescue Fire Fighting (RFF) complex at Jinnah International Airport.

Sources indicated that the current ATC tower, which has been in service for a remarkable 91 years, faces height limitations and is no longer considered adequate for modern aviation needs.

The approval for a new, modern ATC tower is expected to not only address these limitations but also significantly improve visibility and flight safety, meanwhile, the project is expected to complete in a year.

Hundreds of first responders, aviation officials, emergency management personnel and ""injured passengers"" will crowd a portion of the airfield at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Thursday afternoon, but not for a real emergency.

The airport will be conducting the full-scale training exercise from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday. The exercises, mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration, happen every three years.

This year, the ""Operation Convergent"" scenario will reenact a runway incursion leading to a collision between two commercial planes, airport officials said in a media release, involving over 150 passengers and crew combined.

A runway incursion, sometimes referred to as a ""near-miss,"" occurs when an aircraft, vehicle, or person is improperly positioned on an airport's runway, according to the FAA.

Close calls between commercial aircraft are occurring more frequently than previously thought, a recent New York Times investigation found, including multiple recent incidents in South Florida.

For Thursday's simulated incursion, dozens of people from the airport and the community will roleplay as ""injured passengers and reuniting family members,"" the release said. First responders will conduct search and rescue and triage operations, transporting the ""wounded"" to a simulated hospital.

The exercise will also include ""controlled fire,"" the release said.

Around 30 different agencies will participate in total, including the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration, the Florida Department of Transportation, the Broward Sheriff's Office, and Broward County Emergency Management.

The exercise will take place at the northwest portion of the airfield near the North Runway, the release said, but will have ""minimal impact"" on actual airport operations, besides potentially unnerving passing travelers or drivers who don't know what is going on. Participants will enter at Gate 257, located at Southwest 34th Street and West Perimeter Road.

The training exercise comes amid heightened concerns over ""near-misses"" on and off airports. Close calls between commercial planes occur far more often than people previously thought, the New York Times reported in August. Many of them happen on runways, and are fueled by staffing shortages; nearly all air traffic control facilities are understaffed.

Two of the recent near-misses cited in the article occurred in South Florida, at the Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports. In Fort Lauderdale, on May 8, a controller cleared a Delta jet to approach the airport, putting it on a path to collide with a Spirit flight that also had been told to approach.

An F.A.A. safety manager told colleagues that the controller's actions were ""in a word, disturbing.""

The last disaster drill at the Fort Lauderdale airport, ""Operation Silver Lining,"" occurred in November of 2020, according to a county media release. That exercise simulated the emergency landing of a commercial plane.","{'uri': 'sun-sentinel.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SunSentinel', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 265699, 'alexaGlobalRank': 16187, 'alexaCountryRank': 3584}}","[{'uri': 'shira_moolten@sun-sentinel.com', 'name': 'Shira Moolten', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/JetBlue-Spirit-Allegiant_65141.jpg?w=640,None,-0.098039216,24,24,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,fort lauderdale airport to simulate multi plane collision in training exercise thursday,air,0,"Fort Lauderdale airport to simulate multi-plane collision in training exercise ThursdayBy Shira Moolten | smoolten@sunsentinel.com | South Florida Sun Sentinel

Hundreds of first responders, aviation officials, emergency management personnel and ""injured passengers"" will crowd a portion of the airfield at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Thursday afternoon, but not for a real emergency.

The airport will be conducting the full-scale training exercise from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday. The exercises, mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration, happen every three years.

Police Major Deejay Domingo, chief of the BSA Police Station of the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group, said that they have doubled security in the airport to prevent untoward incidents.

Tighter security was imposed after the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) placed all 42 commercial airports in the country on heightened security alert after its Air Traffic Service received a warning via electronic mail that aircraft from Manila bound to Puerto Princesa City, Mactan-Cebu, Bicol, and Davao International Airports ""are about to be set off by a bomb.""

Roel Aranzado, BSA manager, stressed that intelligence reports from the PNP-Aviation Security Group did not find a real-time threat to BSA.

However, we are putting all security units into heightened alert in compliance with the CAAP directive, such as increasing the number of security personnel at critical areas, he said.

Domingo said the situation at BSA is normal but he noted that tightened measures should be implemented to ensure the safety of travelers.

As part of tighter security protocols, Domingo said they are conducting continuous monitoring, random patrolling and checking of airport terminals, intensified perimeter security, and reiterated to airport guards to properly check passengers coming in and out of the airport.

Air traffic has resumed at Germany's Hamburg airport, a spokesperson told Reuters on Monday, after a police operation in response to a threat against a plane from Tehran prompted all landings and take-offs to be halted. A federal police spokesperson earlier said officers, acting on a threat of an attack sent via email, searched a plane with 198 passengers from Tehran that had landed in the northern German city.

The German air force said on its X social media account that it escorted the plane after it entered German airspace east of Berlin due to a bomb threat. Police interviewed passengers, which is normal procedure when a threat is classified as serious, the police spokesperson told Reuters.

No takeoffs or landings were possible because the airport fire brigade was involved with the search, the spokesperson added. The news came on the first day of a special meeting of the

German and French governments in Hamburg, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Emmanuel Macron both attending.

The sheriff's office said deputies responded to a three-vehicle crash on westbound I-275 near the 5.3 mile marker just before 2 p.m. Deputies said cars were slowing down to nearly a stop due to a different crash when a man driving a Ford F350 collided with the rear of the Kia Soul in front of him.

Officials said the Kia Soul then crashed into the UPS delivery van in front of it, and the initial impact also caused the F350 to hit the delivery van as well. Both the F350 and the Kia Soul then hit the guardrail.

The driver of the Kia Soul, 70-year-old Randy Yelton of Aurora, Ind., was taken to UC Medical Center with life-threatening injuries. The passenger, 67-year-old Kristina Yelton, was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital where she was later pronounced dead.

No charges have been filed at this time as the investigation into the crash remains ongoing. Officials said deputies do believe inattention was a contributing factor in the crash.

All lanes of traffic were closed throughout the initial investigation but have since been reopened.

Shannon Airport remains closed after unexpected heavy fog reduced visibility below safe operating limits late on Sunday night.

All outbound services were immediately cancelled while any flights were advised of the situation and diverted to Dublin Airport instead.

Flights in and out of Shannon remain cancelled on Monday morning while the airport is not expected to reopen until later in the day when weather conditions improve.

It is very rare that Shannon is forced to closed as a result of poor visibility. Usually Shannon is the airport that handles flights from Cork, Knock and Dublin when visibility is poor there.

On Sunday night, however, dense fog forced authorities to close the airport after visibility dropped below safe operating limits.

The poor visibility at Shannon was compounded by ongoing essential works being undertaken on a taxiway at the airport. This prevented the airport from implementing 'low visibility procedures' which they would otherwise have been able to.

A number of flights to and from Shannon were cancelled while no flights have operated in or out since the airport was closed shortly after 11.00pm last night.

Several inbound flights which were already on approach to Shannon opted to divert to Dublin Airport.

In a statement this morning, a Shannon Airport spokesperson said: ""Due to unexpected heavy fog conditions during a period of essential taxiway maintenance work, Shannon Airport remains temporarily closed.

""As a result, flights in and out of Shannon Airport may be cancelled or delayed this morning, Monday 9th October. Passengers are advised to check their flight status directly with the airline in advance of travelling to the airport.

""The runway is expected to reopen later this morning once the fog clears, subject to weather conditions. We will continue to update passengers across our social media channels.""

Meanwhile, the Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter was prevented from landing at University Hospital Galway (UHG) last night as a result of poor visibility.

Rescue 115 had been tasked to airlift a patient to hospital from Inis Oírr, the smallest of the Aran Islands. The helicopter crew had planned to fly the patient to UHG. However, on approach to the hospital, visibility was too poor to attempt an approach or landing.

As a result, the helicopter flew the patient to University Hospital Limerick before returning to land in Shannon before the airport was forced to close.

The flights that diverted to Dublin Airport last night include Ryanair flights from Manchester, Stansted, Fuerteventura, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Malta and Porto. Aer Lingus flights from New York and Boston were also diverted.","{'uri': 'roscommonherald.ie', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Roscommon Herald', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 869005, 'alexaGlobalRank': 5674004}}",[],https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjJcXFwvMDhcXFwvMDQxNzE0MThcXFwvc2hhbm5vbi1haXJwb3J0LTEwMjR4NzY4LTEtZTE2NjEwMjMzMDM4NDMuanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjYwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOm51bGwsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiIyODc1YWY3NTA5MDhhYmUxZTEyNWYzYjBlNTFhOGQ1OTVjNjk5NTI4In0=/shannon-airport-1024x768-1-e1661023303843.jpg,eng-8959301,-0.2,120,120,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,flights disrupted as shannon airport closes due to heavy fog,air,1,"Flights disrupted as Shannon Airport closes due to heavy fogFlights disrupted as Shannon Airport closes due to heavy fog

At Ben Gurion airport only Terminal 3 is operating and Terminal 1 has been temporarily closed. 60,000 passengers are expected to pass through Ben Gurion airport today, including many Israelis returning home from vacations abroad and soldiers cutting short overseas stays to return to their army units.

Many foreign carriers including Lufthansa, Air France and Wizz Air have cancelled all flights to and from Israel, due to problems about insurance coverage, which does not allow them to fly to Israel during time of war.

Technically airlines do not need to compensate passengers for canceled flights during war time, which is considered 'force majeure,' but in practice these airlines will likely issue alternative tickets at a later date or repay passenger fares.

Passengers wishing to cancel flights can do so within 14 business days of booking the flight but are required to pay a 5% or NIS 100 cancellation fee.

At Ben Gurion airport only Terminal 3 is operating and Terminal 1 has been temporarily closed. 60,000 passengers are expected to pass through Ben Gurion airport today, including many Israelis returning home from vacations abroad and soldiers cutting short overseas stays to return to their army units.

Many foreign carriers including Lufthansa, Air France and Wizz Air have cancelled all flights to and from Israel, due to problems about insurance coverage, which does not allow them to fly to Israel during time of war.

Technically airlines do not need to compensate passengers for canceled flights during war time, which is considered 'force majeure,' but in practice these airlines will likely issue alternative tickets at a later date or repay passenger fares.

Passengers wishing to cancel flights can do so within 14 business days of booking the flight but are required to pay a 5% or NIS 100 cancellation fee.

All outbound services were immediately cancelled while any inbound flights were advised of the situation and diverted to Dublin Airport instead.

Flights in and out of Shannon remain cancelled this morning while the airport is not expected to reopen until later this morning when weather conditions improve.

It is very rare that Shannon is forced to closed as a result of poor visibility and is usually the airport that handles flights from Cork, Knock and Dublin airports when visibility is poor there.

Last night however, dense fog forced airport authorities to close the airport after visibility dropped below safe operating limits.

The poor visibility at Shannon was compounded by ongoing essential works being undertaken on a taxiway at the airport. This prevented the airport from implementing 'low visibility procedures' which they would otherwise have been able to.

A number of flights to and from Shannon Airport were cancelled while no flights have operated in or out of Shannon since the airport was closed shortly after 11.00pm last night.

Several inbound flights which were already on approach to Shannon opted to divert to Dublin Airport.

Meanwhile, the Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter was prevented from landing at University Hospital Galway (UHG) last night as a result of poor visibility.

Rescue 115 had been tasked to airlift a patient to hospital from Inis Oírr, the smallest of the Aran Islands. The helicopter crew had planned flying the patient to UHG however on approach to the hospital visibility was too poor to attempt and approach or landing.

Know in detail what happened,"German Air Force claims to have escorted a civilian airplane after a bomb scare. The airport authorities also received an email containing a serious threat. Know the entire incident.Hamburg Airport in Germany came to a standstill for about 90 minutes on Monday. The authorities suspended all flights after they received ""a credible threat"" to a specific flight coming from Tehran. Confirming this, Marcus Henschel, a spokesman for the federal police at the airport said that the police took the travelers to an isolated gate and subjected them to vigorous security screenings. He also said that all 198 passengers and 16 crew members left the plane without incident.

The luggage was screened and searched thoroughly, but when the police did not find anything objectionable by 2:15 p.m. local time, they reopened the airport to regular traffic.

Henschel said further that the threat ""was determined to be credible and so we initiated the appropriate response."" He told 'The New York Times' that many recipients including the federal police at the airport received an email containing the threat.

The spokesperson told Reuters that no takeoffs or landings were possible because the airport fire brigade was involved with the search.

The German Air Force on its X account claimed to have escorted a civilian aero plane due to a bomb threat.

It said in the post, ""This morning our #alarmrotte from Laage was activated. A civilian aircraft on the way from Tehran to Hamburg was accompanied by us, after a bomb threat, after entering German airspace east of Berlin until it landed in Hamburg.""

The flight was operated by Iran Air, the country's national carrier. Hamburg's airport is Germany's fifth largest and it handles around 11 million passengers every year.

The bomb scare came at a time when more than one thousand people have been killed and thousands of others have been injured in the battle between Israel Defense Forces and the pro-Palestinian militant outfit Hamas. It began on Saturday morning when Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israeli areas and its fighters barged into the country. Israel retaliated with missile attacks and the bombing of many areas in the Gaza Strip.

Shannon Airport remains closed this morning after unexpected heavy fog reduced visibility below safe operating limits late last night.

It is very rare that Shannon is forced to closed as a result of poor visibility and is usually the airport that handles flights from Cork, Knock and Dublin airports when visibility is poor there.

Last night however, dense fog forced airport authorities to close the airport after visibility dropped below safe operating limits.

The poor visibility at Shannon was compounded by ongoing essential works being undertaken on a taxiway at the airport. This prevented the airport from implementing 'low visibility procedures' which they would otherwise have been able to.

A number of flights to and from Shannon Airport were cancelled while no flight have operated in or out of Shannon since the airport was closed shortly after 11.00pm last night.

Several inbound flights which were already on approach to Shannon opted to divert to Dublin Airport.

In a statement this morning, a Shannon Airport spokesperson said: ""Due to unexpected heavy fog conditions during a period of essential taxiway maintenance work, Shannon Airport remains temporarily closed.

As a result, flights in and out of Shannon Airport may be cancelled or delayed this morning, Monday 9th October. Passengers are advised to check their flight status directly with the airline in advance of travelling to the airport.

The runway is expected to reopen later this morning once the fog clears, subject to weather conditions. We will continue to update passengers across our social media channels.""

Meanwhile, the Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter was prevented from landing at University Hospital Galway (UHG) last night as a result of poor visibility.

Rescue 115 had been tasked to airlift a patient to hospital from Inis Oírr, the smallest of the Aran Islands. The helicopter crew had planned flying the patient to UHG however on approach to the hospital visibility was too poor to attempt and approach or landing.

As a result, the helicopter flew the patient to University Hospital Limerick before returning to land in Shannon before the airport was forced to close.

The airport resumed normal operations at 1 p.m. Saturday after the New Hampshire Air National Guard rented a replacement truck from Rhode Island, according to a news release. No commercial flights were scheduled to depart or land Saturday.

The closure prevented commercial and military aircraft from taking off and landing starting Thursday evening, according to the National Guard.

The Pease Fire Department's fleet of three ""crash trucks"" have been down for more than a year with the airport operating with two loaners which had mechanical issues, one on Tuesday and the other Thursday afternoon, according to a National Guard Facebook post.

The Department of Labor launched inquiries into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after reports of children's grueling working conditions at the companies' plants surfaced.

""There are currently US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division investigations open at Perdue and Tyson Foods. No additional details can be provided as the investigations are ongoing,"" a Labor Department spokesperson told CBS News.

The federal probe into the poultry producers comes after a bombshell report published in New York Times Magazine that zeroed in on the disturbing details of a 14-year-old boy who came from Guatemala to Virginia in order to support his family by working the overnight shifts at a Perdue plant. His arm was nearly torn off while working at a slaughterhouse, the article reported.

The article also documented other cases of children conducting similar work at the Perdue plant, as well as at a nearby Tyson plant. These two companies produce one in three pounds of poultry consumed in the US, the article stated.

Federal law restricts individuals under age 16 from working certain hours, and prohibits minors from working in meat processing plants due to the hazardous conditions.

The Independent has reached out to the Department of Labor, Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms.

A spokesperson for Perdue told CBS News that the company was ""appalled"" by the illegal child labour claims.

""We take the legal employment and safety of each individual working in our facilities very seriously and have strict, longstanding policies in place for Perdue associates to prevent minors from working hazardous jobs in violation of the law,"" the spokesperson said. ""We recognize the systemic nature of this issue and embrace any role we can play in a solution.""

Tyson, however, told the outlet that it had not been made aware of an investigation, so the company did not offer a comment.

The NYT Magazine article reported that the poultry producers used contractors to hire cleaning staff -- a way to circumvent accountability for skirting child labour laws.

One food sanitation contractor recently was forced to pay a $1.5 million penalty for employing over 100 children to work the overnight shifts at meat processing plants across the country, a Department of Labor investigation found in February.

The chief legal officer for the Department of Labor, Seema Nanda, told the New York Times the Biden administration is now looking into whether the larger companies can be held responsible.

""We are long past the day when brands can say that they don't know that they have child labor in their supply chain,"" Ms Nanda said. ""The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 162277, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1300, 'alexaCountryRank': 646}}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/09/03/22/Vaccine_Mandates-Tyson_Foods_67961.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-8927115,-0.043137255,30,30,forced_labor,cd97607d-a2cc-4eb3-8d08-932e5116dc97,top us poultry producers face federal probe over kids cleaning slaughterhouses claims,forced_labor,1,"Top US poultry producers face federal probe over kids cleaning slaughterhouses claims{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong.

""The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable.""",top us poultry producers face federal probe kid clean slaughterhouses claim verifyerrors message verifyerrors verifyerrors something go wrong please try later verifyerrors department labor launch inquiries tyson foods perdue farm report children grueling work condition company plant surface currently us department labor wage hour division investigations open perdue tyson foods additional detail provide investigations ongoing labor department spokesperson tell cbs news federal probe poultry producers come bombshell report publish new york time magazine zero disturb detail year old boy come guatemala virginia order support family work overnight shift perdue plant arm nearly tear work slaughterhouse article report article also document case children conduct similar work perdue plant well nearby tyson plant two company produce one three pound poultry consume us article state federal law restrict individuals age work certain hours prohibit minors work meat process plant due hazardous condition independent reach department labor tyson foods perdue farm spokesperson perdue tell cbs news company appal illegal child labour claim take legal employment safety individual work facilities seriously strict longstanding policies place perdue associate prevent minors work hazardous job violation law spokesperson say recognize systemic nature issue embrace role play solution tyson however tell outlet make aware investigation company offer comment nyt magazine article report poultry producers use contractors hire clean staff way circumvent accountability skirt child labour laws one food sanitation contractor recently force pay million penalty employ children work overnight shift meat process plant across country department labor investigation find february chief legal officer department labor seema nanda tell new york time biden administration look whether larger company hold responsible long past day brand say know child labor supply chain ms nanda say intention make sure higher supply chain hold subcontractors staff agencies accountable,1,"(['Guatemala', 'Virginia', 'Tyson', 'US'], [{'lat': '15.5855545', 'lon': '-90.345759', 'display_name': 'Guatemala', 'boundingbox': ['13.5577935', '17.8165947', '-92.3743889', '-88.2134425']}, {'lat': '37.1232245', 'lon': '-78.4927721', 'display_name': 'Virginia, United States', 'boundingbox': ['36.5407896', '39.4660120', '-83.6753671', '-75.1664350']}, {'lat': '32.7967123', 'lon': '-113.8815958', 'display_name': 'Tyson, Yuma County, Arizona, United States', 'boundingbox': ['32.7767123', '32.8167123', '-113.9015958', '-113.8615958']}, {'lat': '50.5663266', 'lon': '13.820670539566608', 'display_name': 'Ústecký kraj, Northwest, Czechia', 'boundingbox': ['50.0769499', '51.0556945', '12.9403486', '14.6528517']}], ['14-year-old', 'age 16', 'February'], [])","['Guatemala', 'Virginia', 'Tyson', 'US']","['Guatemala', 'Virginia', 'Tyson', 'US']","[{'lat': '15.5855545', 'lon': '-90.345759', 'display_name': 'Guatemala', 'boundingbox': ['13.5577935', '17.8165947', '-92.3743889', '-88.2134425']}, {'lat': '37.1232245', 'lon': '-78.4927721', 'display_name': 'Virginia, United States', 'boundingbox': ['36.5407896', '39.4660120', '-83.6753671', '-75.1664350']}, {'lat': '32.7967123', 'lon': '-113.8815958', 'display_name': 'Tyson, Yuma County, Arizona, United States', 'boundingbox': ['32.7767123', '32.8167123', '-113.9015958', '-113.8615958']}, {'lat': '50.5663266', 'lon': '13.820670539566608', 'display_name': 'Ústecký kraj, Northwest, Czechia', 'boundingbox': ['50.0769499', '51.0556945', '12.9403486', '14.6528517']}]","['Guatemala', 'Virginia, United States', 'Tyson, Yuma County, Arizona, United States', 'Ústecký kraj, Northwest, Czechia']",[],all,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'}

The crew called for help ahead of arriving at Liverpool's John Lennon Airport, where they were met by medics to treat a passenger who had fallen ill during the flight.

The flight departed from Faro in Portugal at 7.49pm on Wednesday, September 27, and arrived two and a half hours later at 10.20pm, the Liverpool Echo reports. Ryanair said its crew called ahead to request medical assistance after a passenger became ill as the plane descended.

A Ryanair spokesperson said: ""The crew of this Faro to Liverpool flight (27 Sept) called ahead to request medical assistance after a passenger became ill during descent. The aircraft landed normally, and was met by medics upon arrival who treated the passenger.""

The incident was described as a ""Squawking 7700 medical emergency"" by Flight Emergency on Twitter as it tracked the plane's journey from Faro in Portugal to Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

Squawk codes are assigned to a flight before departure, with the most well known one being code 7700. This is used to indicate an emergency of any kind, from engine failure, to technical problems and urgent medical emergencies.

Squawking 7700 will allow air traffic control to prepare for a quick landing and inform the authorities of any other support necessary (such as fire services or an ambulance). Most of the time the problems are resolved on flight or by an emergency landing.

Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 spoke to a pilot about these messages and they said: ""In most 'emergencies', we aren't in a big hurry.

According to sources, out of the 44 flights, 22 were inbound while the remaining were outbound. Several flights were scheduled to come in from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Mangaluru, among other locations.

A pro-Kannada and farmers' organisations have called for a 'Karnataka Bandh' today to protest the release of Cauvery river water to neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Section 144 has been imposed in several parts of the state in view of the bandh. The bandh will be in place from 6 am to 6 pm.

According to the sources, a majority of the flights that were cancelled were operated by IndiGo.

However, several flights from different parts of the country have landed at the Bengaluru Airport since 6 am, while several have taken off barring a few which were cancelled.

The flight status has been taken from the official website of the Bengaluru Airport.

The airport's authorities had earlier issued a passenger advisory in view of the bandh, saying that they anticipate a disruption in transport services to and from the airport. They advised passengers to follow alerts from respective airlines, law enforcement agencies and media releases for further updates.

""Due to the one-day Karnataka bandh called by various unions and organisations on September 29, 2023, we anticipate disruption in transport services.

Businesses shutdown, travel was halted, people were required to wear masks and some states instituted vaccine mandates.

Covid also sparked a firestorm of controversy regarding masks, vaccines, and, in some cases, its very existence.

The number of infections eventually started to come down and people began getting back to their normal routines.

However, Covid infections are starting to rise again.

A random Google search found warnings about increasing infections from health officials in Massachusetts, as well as Quebec, and the Sheriff of the Cumberland County Jail in Portland, Maine, who said 17 inmates have tested positive for the respiratory virus, following a summer in which infections had waned.

Air traffic control staff hit

Over in England, London's Gatwick Airport has been hit with has been forced to cap flights at the UK's second largest airport until Sunday due to sickness-related staff shortages.

The airport imposed a strict daily flight cap, with takeoffs and landings at Gatwick reduced to 800 per day until Oct. 1.

Roughly 30% of the facility's air traffic control staff is currently out of action ""for a variety of medical reasons including covid,"" resulting in a slew of cancellations, according to The Points Guy.

Around 164 flights are expected to be canceled during this period, with tens of thousands of passengers likely to be caught up in delays or grounded flights. More than 40 flights were cancelled over the weekend.

""This has been a very difficult decision but the action we have taken today means our airlines can fly reliable flight programs, which gives passengers more certainty that they will not face last minute cancellations,"" Stewart Wingate, chief executive of London Gatwick, said.

Wingate said the airport was working with National Air Traffic Services ""to build resilience in the control tower, and this decision means we can prevent as much disruption as possible.""

NATS said in a statement that ""given the levels of sickness we have experienced over the last few weeks, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to limit the number of flights this week in order to reduce the risk of daily disruption to passengers using the airport.""

The agency added that ""with 30% of tower staff unavailable for a variety of medical reasons including covid, we cannot manage the number of flights that were originally planned for this week.""

Need for long term plan

Ryanair called upon NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe to step down and promised passengers that it will not scrap flights, saying it is ""unacceptable"" that NATS has enforced this because of its ""failure to adequately staff"".

Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, Gatwick's largest operator, told The Mirror that ""while it is regrettable that a temporary limit on capacity at Gatwick Airport is required, we believe that it is the right action by the airport so on the day cancellations and delays can be avoided.""

""Gatwick Airport and NATS now need to work on longer term plan so the resilience of ATC at Gatwick is improved and fit for purpose,"" Lundren said.. ""Our call for a more wide-ranging review of NATS remains so the broader issues can be examined so it can deliver robust services to passengers now and in the future.""

The incident comes after a major disruption at British airports last month following a technical problem at NATS, causing more than 1,500 flights to be canceled and thousands more delayed.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a program in 2021 at seven of the busiest international airports aimed at collecting Covid-19 data, Time reported in June.

Officials with the CDC's meet passengers on select international flights once they clear customs and ask them to voluntarily provide nasal swabs that are pooled and tested by Ginkgo Bioworks, the CDC's lab partner.

""This program is critical for early detection and filling in many blind spots in global surveillance,"" Dr. Cindy Friedman, chief of the travelers' health branch at the CDC, said. ""This is really critical right now as many countries, including the U.S., are decreasing testing by as much as 90%. It's a key piece of biosecurity.""

However, Covid infections are starting to rise again.

A random Google search found warnings about increasing infections from health officials in Massachusetts, as well as Quebec, and the Sheriff of the Cumberland County Jail in Portland, Maine, who said 17 inmates have tested positive for the respiratory virus, following a summer in which infections had waned.

Air traffic control staff hit

Over in England, London's Gatwick Airport has been hit with has been forced to cap flights at the UK's second largest airport until Sunday due to sickness-related staff shortages.

The airport imposed a strict daily flight cap, with takeoffs and landings at Gatwick reduced to 800 per day until Oct. 1.

Roughly 30% of the facility's air traffic control staff is currently out of action ""for a variety of medical reasons including covid,"" resulting in a slew of cancellations, according to The Points Guy.

Around 164 flights are expected to be canceled during this period, with tens of thousands of passengers likely to be caught up in delays or grounded flights. More than 40 flights were cancelled over the weekend.

""This has been a very difficult decision but the action we have taken today means our airlines can fly reliable flight programs, which gives passengers more certainty that they will not face last minute cancellations,"" Stewart Wingate, chief executive of London Gatwick, said.

Wingate said the airport was working with National Air Traffic Services ""to build resilience in the control tower, and this decision means we can prevent as much disruption as possible.""

NATS said in a statement that ""given the levels of sickness we have experienced over the last few weeks, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to limit the number of flights this week in order to reduce the risk of daily disruption to passengers using the airport.""

The agency added that ""with 30% of tower staff unavailable for a variety of medical reasons including covid, we cannot manage the number of flights that were originally planned for this week.""

Need for long term plan

Ryanair called upon NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe to step down and promised passengers that it will not scrap flights, saying it is ""unacceptable"" that NATS has enforced this because of its ""failure to adequately staff"".

Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, Gatwick's largest operator, told The Mirror that ""while it is regrettable that a temporary limit on capacity at Gatwick Airport is required, we believe that it is the right action by the airport so on the day cancellations and delays can be avoided.""

""Gatwick Airport and NATS now need to work on longer term plan so the resilience of ATC at Gatwick is improved and fit for purpose,"" Lundren said.. ""Our call for a more wide-ranging review of NATS remains so the broader issues can be examined so it can deliver robust services to passengers now and in the future.""

The incident comes after a major disruption at British airports last month following a technical problem at NATS, causing more than 1,500 flights to be canceled and thousands more delayed.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a program in 2021 at seven of the busiest international airports aimed at collecting Covid-19 data, Time reported in June.

Officials with the CDC's meet passengers on select international flights once they clear customs and ask them to voluntarily provide nasal swabs that are pooled and tested by Ginkgo Bioworks, the CDC's lab partner.

""This program is critical for early detection and filling in many blind spots in global surveillance,"" Dr. Cindy Friedman, chief of the travelers' health branch at the CDC, said. ""This is really critical right now as many countries, including the U.S., are decreasing testing by as much as 90%. It's a key piece of biosecurity.""

Italian unions on Wednesday announced a 24-hour national strike of workers of the baggage handling sector at airports, paving the way for a raft of delays and cancellations of flights.

The same unions also announced a Friday strike of the same duration for workers of ground transport, such as buses, tubes, and trains.

But Transport Minister Matteo Salvini issued an order limiting the duration of the strike only to four hours, his office said in a statement.

Unions are demanding renewal of the national collective contract for these workers, which has been pending for the last six years, said national union CUB.

In addition, they demand an immediate salary increase in line with inflation, as well as employers; commitment not to increase the workload or hours of work per week in the transport sector.

Salvini already irked unions this summer by limiting the duration of a strike on July 12.

Gatwick Airport took the decision after the pandemic affected the staff of air traffic control and consequently, the airport set a daily limit of 800 flights, affecting both arrivals and departures.

The measures will stay in place until Sunday and National Air Traffic Services (NATS) confirmed that the decision was taken given the levels of sickness experienced over the last few weeks.

The airport said that around 30 per cent of staff in the division within the air traffic control suffered from the pandemic, with some of them even having COVID-19.

Besides, the daily cap will not enable last-minute cancellations and delays for passengers while National Air Traffic Services returns to normalcy, Schengenvisainfo reported.

The severity of the crisis can be gauged from the fact that on September 25th, 50 flights to and from the London airport were cancelled or diverted; EasyJet made the most cancellations, with 42 flights affected.

The Airport's Chief Executive, Stewart Wingate, highlighted that the flights were reduced to prevent further spread, acknowledging that it was a difficult decision

We are working closely with NATS to build resilience in the control tower, and this decision means we can prevent as many disruptions as possible, Wingate said.

The Covid-19 has affected travel for more than three years across the globe but the social distancing protocols were largely lifted in recent months; however, the decision by the management of Gatwick confirms that the pandemic still can disrupt routine lives of flyers.

As far as statistics are concerned, the official UK government website for data and insights on coronavirus (COVID-19) implies that 10,195 positive cases of the infection have been reported between September 10 and September 16 and around 2,767 people have been hospitalised due to the COVID-19 virus during this period.","{'uri': 'en.dailypakistan.com.pk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Pakistan Global', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 253706, 'alexaGlobalRank': 13276, 'alexaCountryRank': 126}}",[],https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/digital_images/large/2023-09-27/this-london-airport-is-reducing-flights-again-due-to-covid-19-1695823346-2754.jpg,eng-8926803,-0.247058824,59,59,air,f530b349-ebfe-4bd0-bc0c-11d61b7bbac8,this london airport is reducing flights again due to covid,air,1,"This London airport is reducing flights again due to Covid-19 LONDON - The second-busiest airport in London has reduced the number of operational flights due to an outbreak of COVID-19.

There were few initial details about the incident, as well as a rocket that struck a neighborhood just northwest of the airport, killing a child. The Taliban initially described the two strikes as separate incidents, though information on both remained scarce and witnesses heard only one large blast Sunday in the Afghan capital.

The airstrike came as the United States winds down a historic airlift that saw tens of thousands evacuated from Kabul's international airport, the scene of much of the chaos that engulfed the Afghan capital since the Taliban took over two weeks ago. After an Islamic State affiliate's suicide attack that killed over 180 people, the Taliban increased its security around the airfield as Britain ended its evacuation flights Saturday.

U.S. military cargo planes continued their runs into the airport Sunday, ahead of a Tuesday deadline earlier set by President Joe Biden to withdraw all troops from America's longest war. However, Afghans remaining behind in the country worry about the Taliban reverting to their earlier oppressive rule -- something fueled by the recent shooting death of a folk singer in the country by the insurgents.

Two American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers.

U.S. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the American military's Central Command, called the drone strike an action taken in ""self-defense."" He said authorities continued ""assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time.""

""We are confident we successfully hit the target,"" Urban said. ""Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.""

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid earlier said in a message to journalists that the U.S. strike targeted a suicide bomber as he drove a vehicle loaded with explosives. Mujahid offered few other details.

The strike was the second by America since the airport suicide bombing. On Saturday, a strike in Nangarhar province killed an Islamic State member believed to be involved in planning attacks against the United States in Kabul.

The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group's more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority, including a 2020 assault on a maternity hospital in Kabul in which they killed women and infants.

The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 9/11 attacks, which al-Qaida orchestrated while being sheltered by the group.

The rocket attack struck Kabul's Khuwja Bughra neighborhood, said Rashid, the Kabul police chief who goes by one name. Video obtained by The Associated Press in the aftermath of the attack showed smoke rising from building at the site around a kilometer (half a mile) from the airport.

No group immediately claimed the attack, however militants have fired rockets in the past.

Meanwhile, the family of a folk singer north of Kabul say the Taliban killed him under unclear circumstances in recent days.

The shooting of Fawad Andarabi came in the Andarabi Valley for which he was named, an area of Baghlan province some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kabul. The valley had seen upheaval since the Taliban takeover, with some districts in the area coming under the control of militia fighters opposed to the Taliban rule. The Taliban say they have since retaken those areas, though neighboring Panjshir in the Hindu Kush mountains remains the only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces not under its control.

The Taliban previously came out to Andarabi's home and searched it, even drinking tea with the musician, his son Jawad Andarabi told the AP. But something changed Friday.

""He was innocent, a singer who only was entertaining people,"" his son said. ""They shot him in the head on the farm.""

His son said he wanted justice and that a local Taliban council promised to punish his father's killer.

Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, told the AP that the insurgents would investigate the incident, but had no other details on the killing.

Andarabi played the ghichak, a bowed lute, and sang traditional songs about his birthplace, his people and Afghanistan as a whole. A video online showed him at one performance, sitting on a rug with the mountains of home surrounding him as he sang.

""There is no country in the world like my homeland, a proud nation,"" he sang. ""Our beautiful valley, our great-grandparents' homeland.""

Karima Bennoune, the United Nations special rapporteur on cultural rights, wrote on Twitter that she had ""grave concern"" over Andarabi's killing.

""We call on governments to demand the Taliban respect the #humanrights of #artists,"" she wrote.

Agnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, similarly decried the killing.

""There is mounting evidence that the Taliban of 2021 is the same as the intolerant, violent, repressive Taliban of 2001,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""20 years later. Nothing has changed on that front.""

Also on Sunday, private banks across Afghanistan resumed their operations. However, they limited withdrawals to no more than the equivalent of $200 a day.

While some complained of still being unable to access their money, government employees say they haven't been paid over the last four months. The Afghani traded around 90.5 to $1, continuing its depreciation as billions of dollars in the country's reserves remain frozen overseas.
