The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, doing business as Amtrak, is the national passenger railroad company of the United States. The truck driver was rushed to a trauma centre while the other person was taken to a medical centre with a minor medical emergency, as per the Ventura County Fire Department. The remaining fourteen, who sustained minor injuries were shifted from the scene, the tweet added. The authorities reported that it did not appear any other Coast Starlight train passengers were hurt, as per CNN. According to a statement from the rail line, Train No. 14 was travelling from Los Angeles to Seattle at approximately 11:15 am (local time) when it hit the vehicle blocking the rails near Moorpark, California, roughly 50 miles to the northwest of Los Angeles. Amtrak announced that it will look into the event in collaboration with regional law enforcement. Amtrak's statement said, The train derailed as a result of the impact but remained upright. Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements, according to CNN. There were about 198 passengers and 13 staff members evacuated and rescued from the train. The situation has been cleared, according to the fire department and emergency medical personnel. The passengers were transported to a reunification centre so that they could contact their family members.

(AP) - Several days before a Norfolk Southern conductor trainee was killed by a metal beam protruding from a parked railcar on the next track, workers at a YOU.S. Pipe facility noticed the beam was hanging off the top of the car but never told the railroad about it, federal investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board released those details this week in a report on the interviews it conducted after Walter James Griffin was killed near Bessemer, Alabama, on December 13. Investigators will not release their final report on the death until later. The accident happened as Griffin's train was passing another train that was in the process of picking up several cars that had been parked on a siding, including ones loaded with scrap metal from YOU.S. Pipe's nearby facility. The beam struck Griffin in the head as it smashed into the locomotive he was riding in and injured the conductor sitting behind him with broken glass. The death was one of the incidents the NTSB cited when it announced it would conduct a broad investigation into Norfolk Southern's safety practices after a fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. That February derailment prompted a national reckoning on rail safety and calls for reforms. NTSB investigators interviewed the crews of both trains and YOU.S. Pipe workers and reviewed security videos in the days after the Alabama accident. Video taken on December 7 showed a piece of metal hanging off the top of the railcar at YOU.S. Pipe's facility. At one point, a worker there even put up caution tape around the railcar because of the metal hanging off of it. But that caution tape was gone before Norfolk Southern's crew arrived to pick up the car. This incident was a tragedy, and our thoughts remain with Mr. Griffins family, friends, and colleagues. Were continuing to work closely with the NTSB as they complete their investigation, the railroad said in a statement. It declined to answer questions about the accident because of the ongoing investigation. YOU.S. Pipe officials did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday. Griffin's family sued Norfolk Southern in the spring over his death. That lawsuit remains pending. Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest freight railroads, operating in the eastern United States.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"NTSB: Workers at YOU.S. Pipe facility noticed metal beam days before accident.

Wednesday was a testing day for people living in the path of Storm Babet, which disrupted quite a few areas. Cork got a particularly bad lash from the storm, as readers are no doubt aware. If your smartphone was working yesterday, you probably saw the footage which was being uploaded from all over Cork. That footage showed scenes which custom dictates we describe as unprecedented and shocking, but they were also frightening, to be honest. Streets were flooded in and around Cork, with people reporting areas which had never been flooded before being inundated. There was traffic gridlock in many parts of the city during the day and it was clear that some cars had simply been abandoned in rising waters. People who had commuted to work could not get back home, or got back home hours later than usual; both rail and bus services in Cork were seriously affected by the weather. The litany of black spots is depressing, and in some cases depressingly familiar: Blackpool flooded, for instance, but so did Glanmire village and roads were impassable in Ballyvolane, Rochestown, Blarney, Tower, and elsewhere. The Straight Rd flooded when the Lee itself burst its banks. East Cork suffered severely. The Defence Forces were called in to help people in Midleton, which was simply impassable, its main street under several feet of water and dozens of premises flooded. Killeagh was flooded a few miles further east, while the Ladysbridge-Cloyne road was a no-go zone, damaged by floodwater. At the border of Cork and Waterford, the walls were collapsing along one stretch of the N25 by the sea outside Youghal. This morning, aprs le dluge, the questions arise, naturally enough. For instance, Met ireann issued an orange warning for Cork (given before expected weather conditions that could significantly impact people, property, and activity in an area, according to met.ie). Should that have been a red warning (rarely issued but when it is, people in the areas expected to be affected should take action to protect themselves andor their properties)? On the basis of their own definitions, a red warning should have been issued for Cork. As reported here, Met ireann will be issuing fewer Status Yellow weather warnings in future, with the forecaster set to re-evaluate the thresholds for such warnings as it acknowledged concerns about warning fatigue from the public. Unfortunately, that was a little late for Cork this week. A red warning yesterday morning would have closed schools and immediately cut the number of journeys being made; as it turned out, some schools made the decision to close early anyway, but that meant parents had to make the journey to collect children at the height of the rainstorm. It is also clear that people commuted to work in the belief that an orange warning heralded testing but not dangerous weather -- only to find conditions far more perilous later in the day. Another question: Is it acceptable that a 21st-century city should be so seriously affected by heavy rainfall? One of the traditional replies on Leeside to such queries is to point out that for hundreds of years the low-slung city of Cork, central marshy island and all, has been susceptible to riverine flooding at high tides, a victim of its own geography. Yet the obvious retort is that if this has been common knowledge for hundreds of years, surely it is past time for a solution. Instead, there have been years of uncertainty and dispute about a proposed flood defence scheme, with no sign of progress while the city is literally inundated. It should be acknowledged that the amount of rain which fell yesterday was calamitous -- by some measures a month's rainfall fell in approximately 24 hours. That amount of rain would test the best-prepared drainage systems. Can we say that yesterday was exceptional as well as calamitous, however? Climate change is likely to produce more such events, not fewer. And if those future events occur on the same scale, as is widely expected, then a different response will be needed. Multi-agency approach A co-ordinated, multi-agency approach involving municipal and State agencies will be necessary if lives are not going to be lost in future extreme weather events. Are we going to need a Cork rain tsar, a single figure who will take temporary control of the city when it is in danger of being flooded to pull the various agencies together? Would not that be better than what we experienced yesterday? Looking into the future means seeing where other headaches are likely to occur down the line. We have seen in recent years, for instance, that there are ambitious plans for developing and expanding Cork -- to create an entirely new suburb, more or less, down on the Docklands-Marina area. But how meaningful can those plans be if the area itself or adjacent arteries such as the Centre Park and Monahan Roads are likely to flood, as happened yesterday? Or if the entire city can be paralysed by heavy rain? Ambitions of Cork acting as some kind of regional counterbalance to the concentration of population and resources in Dublin are laudable. However, based on this week, it looks like they will not survive their first encounter with prolonged rainfall. Credit must be given to those who defied the elements yesterday to help others. The people who helped neighbours and friends stranded in cars by rising waters. Those who were invited into bars and restaurants for shelter and food, particularly in the Midleton area. Sarsfields Hurling Club in Glanmire opened the gates to its main playing field to let flood water run off which would otherwise have flooded local homes and businesses. The club, which won the Cork senior hurling title just last Sunday, explained their motivation in a statement: As a result, our main pitch essentially became a flood plain in order to relieve the flooding to the immediate Riverstown area, Orchard Manor, and surrounding businesses. We won a county, lost a pitch, but hopefully saved a part of the Glanmire community. Those are the gestures which show what a community really is. Sars' actions were proactive and decisive, qualities much in demand yesterday -- and not on show everywhere they were needed -- but the city as a whole cannot rely on the spontaneous generosity of voluntary organisations. This week's events must be seen as the turning point. Cork needs that specific plan with a local focus, preferably managed by an individual with the authority and power to co-ordinate the various bodies involved when the floods threaten again. And to overrule central assumptions on the basis of local evidence, if need be. If not, then the city can be expected to grind to a halt again when the next rainstorm hits. Or squelch to a halt, to be more accurate. A co-ordinated multi-agency approach involving municipal and State agencies will be necessary if lives are not going to be lost in future",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Wednesday was a testing day for people living in the path of Storm Babet.

The RapidX trains are all set to commence passenger operations from October 21, a day after its scheduled inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The six-coach RapidX trains will have one premium class coach while the remaining five coaches will be standard. The NCRTC, the agency executing the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project, released the fare for the 17km priority section in Ghaziabad. This will be country's first RRTS stretch to commence passenger operations on a 17km section comprising stations of Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai Depot. The fares have been defined from station to station and the present fare charges will be applicable for travelling between five stations of the priority section, said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer, NCRTC. According to the rolled out fares, a passenger on a standard class coach will have to pay 50 for travelling from Sahibabad to Duhai Depot, while a traveller on the premium coach will have to pay 100 for the same distance. Most of the commuters who travel between Ghaziabad and Sahibabad will have to she will out 30 up to the Sahibabad RRTS station for travelling in standard class coach and 60 for premium class travel. According to the fare chart, the per kilometre cost of travelling on the full 17km priority section is 2.94km in a standard coach and 5.88 on a premium coach. According to the 2009 project report on the RRTS project, the initial fare was expected to be 2 per kilometre for the entire 82km network.This figure was expected to climb further owing to inflation and price hike. Normally, a hired auto in Ghaziabad may charge anything from 100-150 for the 17km distance between Sahibabad and Duhai Depot. The auto may charge between 75-90 to travel from Ghaziabad to Sahibabad.The option of Metro is not available between the two points. But Delhi Metro sources said 10 and 60 are the minimum and maximum fares for travelling on the Metro network. Explaining the rationale for the RapidX fares, NCRTC officials said these were decided after a comprehensive study by IIM-Ahmedabad. All factors were analysed before finalising the fare. These factors included the consideration of cost, viability, fare in other similar transport mediums across the globe and also the factor of realisation of cost. RapidX is altogether a different system from Metro trains and the two cannot be compared, said a spokesperson from NCRTC. The NCRTC officials said children below 90cm height will be allowed to travel free while various ticketing options have been put in place for passengers. These options include digital QR code based tickets phone app RAPIDX Connect, national common mobility card (NCMC), ticket vending machines (TVMs) and paper QR code-based journey ticket. The officials said they have provided four TVMs each at Sahibabad and Ghaziabad stations while two each have been provided at Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai Depot stations. The officials said that luggage of dimensions 80cm x 50cm x 30cm and up to a maximum weight of 25kg per passenger will be allowed.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Passengers travelling by RapidX trains will have to spend 20-50 for a standard coach seat on the 17km priority section from Sahibabad to Duhai Depot in Ghaziabad.

With the water chest high in Midleton's Darling Buds pre-school, a spokesperson for the creche said that adults helped remove children by piggy back after staff and children became trapped inside. Similarly, parents had to wade through waters at the Educate Together National School to collect their children. The main road in Midleton was under 3ft feet of water, while the town itself saw roads both in and out of the area become impassable after the Owenacurra River burst its banks -- requiring assistance from the army and civil defence. Problems were exacerbated shortly after lunch time, when the wind and rain caused two power outages, one on either side of the town. ESB engineers were unable to wade through the floods before three more faults were recorded in the afternoon -- including one near the community hospital in the town. Local Councillor Susan McCarthy described bins, traffic cones, benches and even a skip floating on the street. Its even dangerous wading through it, she said. At one stage a man was seen kayaking down the street to check on people trapped in their businesses and homes. Locals stranded Independent Cllr Liam Quaide told the Irish Examiner that the flooding in Midleton really shows our vulnerability to climate change and the need for adaptation as well as mitigation. I was bringing my daughter home from CUH and I cannot get to (our home) in Broomfield, because both ways are blocked. We are stranded in the Market Green centre where some people we have met have been waiting here for several hours to get home. All rail services between Cork and Cobh and Cork and Midleton were suspended due to water on the line. Cork County Council confirmed that more than 100 properties were flooded in the town. One of those belonged to Himalaya Yoga Studio on Mill Road. Maeve O'Brien from the studio said that they had been hit very hard She explained that due to the floods, they could not reach the studio to fully assess the damage. It is a huge blow for all the businesses in Midleton. Ideally, we would open our doors tomorrow but we are not too hopeful of that. Ms O'Brien said it was absolutely crucial that all stakeholders worked together to get a flood relief system in place to prevent future issues. Councillor Danielle Twomey said the flood was the town's worst in living memory. She was one of the parents of children at Midleton's Educate Together School who had to wade through knee-high water along Mill Road to get to the school. We drove our cars as near to the school as we could and then just waded out to the school, she said. I was there to collect my two daughters and although the school itself was not flooded, the road to it was like a river. The water subsided after a while but when we went to collect our children, we had no idea how bad things would be. We did not want to take any chances. So, you had this scene of parents wading through flood waters with children on their backs. I have never seen anything like it in my life. She said several estates and Midleton hospital were under a metre of water and access to Midleton from Cloyne was cut off. A rest centre was established in the town's community centre to facilitate those who required evacuation. Meanwhile, in Killeagh, the historic Thatch pub and restaurant was under a metre of water after the adjacent River Dissour burst through at about 9.30am. Proprietor Debbie Walsh said the water was unstoppable and had nowhere to go as it swept across the beer garden and into the bar, kitchen, and store room. The pub, which dates from the mid 1600s, was almost destroyed by fire prior to Debbie and husband Brian taking it over seven years ago. The force of the water was actually dangerous, Debbie recalls. The devastation has been extremely distressing and we are exhausted, she added, but we will clean up and carry on. We are likely to be closed over the coming days, she added. Imokily GAA secretary Patrick Mulcahy said the flood was the worst in the area and that many older generations have never seen this before. Youghal's town centre escaped flooding but some estates and walls in the town were severely affected. A section of wall that was being restored and scaffolding collapsed on Lighthouse Hill, while a huge pond was created at Chestnut Drive estate, as fast-flowing torrents ran downhill. Resident Shane Tobin said a wall collapse redirected almost two metres of water from the rear of his house at the last minute. Meanwhile, James O'Connor TD, who surveyed flood damage in Midleton, said questions need to be asked about why there was not a red weather warning. The level of damage to Midleton and surrounding areas as far as Glanmire has been devastating There is a real sense of destruction, he said. Business have been flooded, the Defence Forces are here on the street, the community hospital has been evacuated and I see school children being brought up the main street on the back of trailers. People were not expecting this and it begs the question: why there not a red warning provided last night? Where was the red warning? The amount of water has been biblical. Water is running out under doors on the Main Street. It is just soul destroying. The Main Street is ruined. He said that what is needed now is support for families and businesses hit by the flooding. People are needing support and luckily the Park Hotel has started hosting families.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"More than 100mm of rain fell from last night all the way through to this afternoon.

Parents had to wade through waters at the Educate Together National School to collect their children. All rail services between Cork and Cobh and Cork and Midleton were suspended due to water on the line.","{'BART': {'major railway transportation disruption news': 0.5688750147819519, 'severe and extreme weather news ': 0.12888097763061523, 'major maritime transportation disruption news': 0.0902889147400856, 'personal or small scale isolated event and news': 0.07432080805301666, 'general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends': 0.06717514991760254, 'other news': 0.03965945169329643, 'warehouse and storage facilities disruption or destruction news': 0.022189751267433167, 'major air transportation disruption news': 0.006345581263303757, 'major and large scale worker strike actions': 0.002264329232275486}}",major railway transportation disruption news,severe and extreme weather news

The warning is in place for parts of Scotland from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday. Yellow alerts for rain cover eastern England and the rest of Scotland on Friday. The agency said the storm could cause exceptional rainfall reaching up to 250mm. The red warning states there is danger to life from fast flowing or deep floodwater in Aberdeenshire and Angus, with extensive flooding and road closures expected. Humza Yousaf, Scotland's First Minister, said that travel should be avoided unless absolutely essential. Mass rail closures were announced for eastern Scotland until Friday, with lines from Perth to Aberdeen and to Aviemore not running. Network Rail said trains between Aberdeen and Elgin are also cancelled. Aberdeenshire Council alerted residents to significant supplies of sandbags that it had stockpiled to protect their homes from flooding. The red warning alerts people to the danger of communities becoming cut off for days. The last red warning for rain was in February 2020 when Wales was hit by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest recorded levels and more than 1,400 homes and businesses flooded. At least three people died. On Wednesday trains were suspended in Greater Manchester after a tree was brought down onto overhead power lines. Cornwall and Devon were battered by gale force winds and heavy rain with 45mph gusts in coastal areas of the South. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution warned that the storm poses a safety risk to those visiting the coast and that the public should exercise extreme caution, particularly near cliffs, seafronts and piers. In the Devon town of Paignton, several beach huts were destroyed in the extreme weather as waves battered the seafront. Sean White, of watersports company and community club Soak Lifestyle, in Torquay, said on Facebook: One of our shipping containers, our sports one, ended up in the ocean and the other one has been bashed like a washing machine. We have lost everything, and obviously that is totally devastating and we are lacking words among all the emotion right now. Mr White added that he did not account for the storm surge which made an extra metre or so tide that we had not anticipated. He and his business partner Laura Rickard managed to arrange for cranes to save the container that held their coffee shop by lifting it away from the seafront. County Cork in Ireland, where residents posted videos of flooding to social media, experienced 75mm of rainfall across the course of the day, the Met Office said.

The Met Office has taken the step of issuing a rare 'red weather warning' amid concerns that the storm could cause severe damage, possibly even posing a danger to life. Laurencekirk, Montrose and Forfar are among the towns covered by the alert, which comes into effect at 6pm tomorrow and is due to last until 12pm on Friday - with the communities being warned of possible collapsing buildings, road closures, loss of power and extensive flooding. It is the first time a red warning has been issued for rain since Storm Dennis pounded the country in 2020. But just what does a red weather warning mean? A red weather warning is the highest possible alert which can be issued by the Met Office. According to their website it means that 'dangerous weather is expected and, if you have not already done so, you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the severe weather. The Met Office adds: 'It is very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure. 'You should avoid travelling, where possible, and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.' Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly said of Storm Babet: 'Confidence has increased in the chances of considerable impacts from rainfall in parts of the east of Scotland from Storm Babet, which has resulted in the escalation to the red warning. '100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely within the warning period, with some locations likely to see 200-250mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts with flooding likely.' Other parts of the country are facing amber and yellow weather warnings in the wake of the storm. The Met Office describes an amber warning as 'an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans. 'This means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property. You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. 'You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact. Yellow weather warnings are issued when the weather is likely to have a more low-level effect. Many are issued when it is likely that the weather will cause some low level impacts, including some disruption to travel in a few places,' the Met Office says. 'Many people may be able to continue with their daily routine, but there will be some that will be directly impacted and so it is important to assess if you could be affected. As these are used for a range of weather scenarios, the advice is to 'read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning'. While it is the first red warning issued for rain for some time, there have been a number of red warnings given for other extreme weather events in recent years. A red warning was issued for the South-east and east of England, and south Wales in February 2022 in the wake of Storm Eunice, which brought with it winds of up to 122mph, while 2021's Storm Arwen also led to a red weather warning for wind - covering a large section of the east coast from Aberdeen to Newcastle. However, the most recent red warning was for heat - and it marked the first time the Met Office had issued such an alert for high temperatures. That one, issued in July 2022, covered most of central and Southern England, when the hottest part of the UK reached above 40C for the first time ever.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Met Office has issued a rare 'red weather warning' for parts of Scotland.

Earlier this year, RTS reported on a Fractured Rail Identified in Fiery BNSF Minnesota Derailment. In that April report, BNSF analyzed a section of fractured rail following March 2023's fiery derailment that forced evacuations in southwest Minnesota. . . however they have not officially concluded that the broken rail caused the crash. On April 18, the NTSB released a preliminary report on the Minnesota derailment and stated that a train carrying 14 hazardous materials tank cars was traveling north, and at 12:58 a.m. local time, 10 tank cars derailed, hazardous materials were released and contributed to a fire. On Monday, October 16, NTSB Newsroom announced via Twitter that it has opened a docket for its investigation of the March 30, 2023 derailment of a BNSF Railway freight train on the Marshall District in Raymond, Minnesota.

The memo goes on in more detail surrounding DOT 117 Tank Car Design and Vulnerability and how preliminary findings show that hazardous material releases occurred from five breached tank cars, and two of these derailed tank cars sustained punctured shells that released ethanol, which ignited and destroyed manway gaskets of the three additional tank cars and led to the further release of hazardous materials and spreading fire. Similarly, issues were also identified in NTSB investigation HMD22LR001 and insuffiency of tank car thermal protection system design and thermal performance regulations and standards for gaskets used in tank car service equipment are being addressed. The NTSB issued 7 new safety recommendations with 2 to the FRA, 3 to PHMSA, and 2 to the AAR.

Ukraine had repeatedly asked the US administration for ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Kyiv pledged not to use them inside Russia's territory but said the powerful weapons would alter the course of the 20-month-old war. Deploying the weapons would allow Ukrainian forces to disrupt previously unreachable supply lines, air bases and rail networks used by Russia in occupied territories, senior officials said. Ukrainian Special Forces, without initially mentioning the ATACMS, said that nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher, runways and other equipment had been destroyed, and heavy losses inflicted on Russian forces. There was no official comment from Russia. But a Moscow-installed official in partially Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia region, which is home to Berdiansk, said that cluster munitions from the ATACMS missiles were found there on Tuesday. Earlier, Rogov said that Russian air defences had ensured that a Ukrainian air attack near Berdiansk was not successful. Mr Zelensky's comments mark the first confirmed use in Ukraine of the ATACMS, which can fly up to 310km. The country's Defence Ministry promised on X, formerly Twitter, that there would be more news to come. As you can see, it is now possible to hit targets impeccably, with great precision, giving the enemy no chance, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told national television.

Exploiting the Palestinian issue has long been a strategic ploy of the Iranian regime. Over the years, Iran's approach has consistently been to sow division and spread Islamic fundamentalism among the Palestinian people, effectively undermining the mainstream Palestinian leadership that is committed to peace and a two-state solution. Hamas was founded in Gaza in 1987. It was an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose candidate Mohamed Morsi won the June 2012 Egyptian presidential elections, but was overthrown within a year after mass protests. Morsi and most of the Brotherhood's leadership were imprisoned in Egypt and the organization was designated as a terrorist group and its assets were seized. Inspired by the Brotherhood, Hamas published a charter in 1988 defining itself as an Islamic national liberation and resistance movement with a policy of establishing an Islamic State in Palestine. Hamas differs from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in that it rejects negotiations with Israel and advocates armed resistance. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2006, defeating its rival Fatah in elections, and has maintained this position ever since. The relationship between Iran and Hamas began in the early 1990s, a few years after Hamas was founded. Iran sees support for Hamas as a means of challenging Israel and extending its influence in the region. Over time, Iran has provided significant financial support to Hamas, particularly after it took power in Gaza in 2006. Iran's aid enabled Hamas to develop its own weapons, with Khaled Mashal, the former head of its political bureau, describing Hamas as the spiritual son of (Ayatollah) Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.When Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006, the Iranian regime increased its support, providing funding, rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles, as well as training and technical assistance through its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) elite Quds Force, responsible for foreign operations. Iran's support for Hamas has continued to strengthen, particularly in the period from 2015 to 2018, which was characterized by the growing threat from Israel and Hamas's increased reliance on Iranian sponsorship. The potency of the relationship was further evidenced by Iran's increased presence in Gaza through proxies such as Islamic Jihad. Some of the fighters involved in the recent terrorist assault on Israel led by Hamas militants belonged to Islamic Jihad, the second-most powerful Palestinian militant group operating in the Gaza Strip with backing from Iran. Like Hamas, Islamic Jihad is also designated as a terrorist group, blacklisted by the UK, EU and US. The closeness of the relationship was amplified in August 2021, when the Hamas leader - Ismail Haniyeh and his team, were invited to attend the inauguration of President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran. Raisi, dubbed 'The Butcher of Tehran' for his notorious role as an executioner during the 1988 massacre of more than 30,000 political prisoners, ensured that the Hamas delegation was met at the airport and seated in the front row during the ceremony. During a series of high-level meetings following the inauguration, Hamas confirmed its unwavering support for the 'axis of resistance' against Israel and for the Iranian regime's proxy wars in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Since then, there has been an increasing flow of rockets, anti-tank missiles and other sophisticated weaponry, smuggled into Gaza through tunnels from Egypt, some of which are large enough to be fitted with rail tracks, and from ships docking in Gaza's ports. Iran has also provided huge financial support to Hamas, both directly and indirectly. Direct funding includes cash payments to Hamas' operatives and officials, as well as specific operations. Indirect funding includes the provision of goods and services, such as medical supplies and construction materials, which Hamas can sell or trade for income. The funding has increased to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Last year, the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, told Al-Jazeera TV that Iran had funded its deterrent forces against Israel and had helped to build attack tunnels to be used to surprise the Israelis. But it must be remembered that the Iranian people do not support the regime's massive spending on proxy wars and militias like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, across the Middle East. With a collapsing economy and widespread poverty, the recent nationwide uprising in Iran has been marked by protesters chanting slogans decrying financial aid to groups like Hamas, highlighting the deep gulf between the mullahs' regime and the public it is supposed to serve. Hamas militants share a philosophy of hatred. They are misogynists. They hate the Jews. They hate Christians. They hate atheists. They hate alcohol, music and Western freedoms. These pet hates manifested themselves in a frenzy of brutality and murder, when they attacked young party goers attending the Supernova music festival at the Re'i am Kibbutz, just three miles from the border with Gaza. The all-night, alcohol-fueled party would have represented the embodiment of all of the militants' warped prejudices, unleashing a bloodbath of mass slaughter and butchery. As the crisis unfolds and retaliation by the Israeli military escalates, killing hundreds of Palestinian militants and civilians, there is only one winner likely to emerge from the conflict....Iran. Already Saudi Arabia, a signatory to the Abraham Accords that sought rapprochement with Israel, has put the plans to normalize relations with Tel Aviv on ice. This will be seen as a great victory in Tehran. Pulverising Gaza will only create a new generation of Hamas terrorists. As Naftali Bennett, the former prime minister of Israel once said, there is no use in struggling against the tentacles of the Iranian regime that encircle Israel. Better to strike at the head of the octopus in Tehran. Seventy five million Iranians want rid of the mullahs' regime. We should support them.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Iran's backing for Hamas and their deadly terrorist attack on Israel has deep roots. Exploiting the Palestinian issue has long been a strategic ploy of the Iranian regime. Iran sees support for Hamas as a means of challenging Israel and extending its influence in the region. Iran's aid enabled Hamas to develop its own weapons, with Khaled Mashal, the former head of its political bureau, describing Hamas as the spiritual son of (Ayatollah) Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.","{'BART': {'general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends': 0.29141178727149963, 'other news': 0.28581222891807556, 'warehouse and storage facilities disruption or destruction news': 0.11504063010215759, 'personal or small scale isolated event and news': 0.08597288280725479, 'major railway transportation disruption news': 0.05434884876012802, 'severe and extreme weather news ': 0.051628340035676956, 'major maritime transportation disruption news': 0.04977243393659592, 'major air transportation disruption news': 0.033286985009908676, 'major and large scale worker strike actions': 0.03272590413689613}}","general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends",other news

That would never be the way that we would operate. Both CEOs were questioned by MPs at a special session of the committee about the bank holiday Monday systems failure. The main and back-up computer systems that normally assist air-traffic controllers failed around 8.30am on the morning of 28 August 2023. The because was later found to be a rogue flight plan for a French aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Paris, which contained duplicate waypoints. Nats engineers solved the previously unknown problem about eight hours later. For much of that time, air-traffic controllers were obliged to revert to manual handling - reducing the capacity of UK airspace by 85 per cent. The failures led to more than 2,000 flight cancellations, affecting over 300,000 passengers. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, condemned the delay between the initial failure and when carriers were alerted shortly after 11am. He said that with more notice, airlines could have put emergency procedures in place much earlier. There was a three-hour window wasted, he said. Mr O'Leary described the Nats boss as vastly overpaid and incompetent and said Mr Rolfe should resign or be sacked after the incident. Like most airlines we did not find out from Nats, we found out from Eurocontrol shortly after 11am, he said. The numpties at Nats did not tell us. We had to find out from someone else that they would crashed their system. Nats said the standard procedure was for Eurocontrol, which oversees air-traffic control across Europe, to communicate with airlines. Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer of easyJet, said: The first time we heard from Nats was a letter the following day. In total, her airline had cancelled around 600 flights. That is thought to have affected more than 100,000 passengers. She said 30,000 passengers had been re-routed by another carrier or on other forms of transport. Eurostar laid on extra trains between Paris and London in the days following the air-traffic control shutdown to help UK-bound passengers, with airlines footing the bill for rail tickets. Both Ryanair and easyJet are thought to have incurred around 15m each in costs for hotels, meals and re-routing passengers. Jonathan Hinkles, chief executive of Loganair, said airlines were insurers of last resort because of the current regime of passengers' rights. If you buy a new washing machine, you have the choice to buy extended warranty, he said. If you are insuring a car, you can choose between fully comprehensive. Every single air ticket that is sold comes with an extended warranty and fully comprehensive insurance. Martin Rolfe, chief executive of Nats, was questioned immediately afterwards by MPs. He told the committee: I absolutely understand the frustration of the airlines. The shutdown was triggered, he said, despite development work trying to predict as many obscure circumstances as you can. Within 20 seconds of the main system shutting down, the back-up did the same. The back-up system had taken over on four occasions over the last five years without an issue, Mr Rolfe said. He added: In the event of something happening that is inexplicable, it is handed on to humans. We have put in a number of fixes to ensure it cannot happen again. While charges at Nats had increased due to dwindling traffic during Covid, Alistair Borthwick - chief financial officer at Nats - said that since 2002 costs have reduced by 38 per cent in real terms. Nats is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The authority's chief executive, Rob Bishton, described the Nats system failure as a rare and very improbable event that had had huge impacts with people who were travelling. He said Nats had been fined 420,000 in 2016 and 240,000 in 2018 for shortcomings in the service provided, but said the effect of penalties could be to push up air-traffic control charges for airlines, and ultimately passengers. Mr Bishton also complimented both sides in the row. He said: The airlines' response during the incident was in many cases above and beyond what we would expect as a regulator. Later, he added: I believe Nats has been very open and transparent.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Main and back-up computer systems that normally assist air-traffic controllers failed around 8.30am on the morning of 28 August 2023.

Mark Drakeford told MPs belonging to the Welsh Affairs Committee that the petition will be responded to in the usual way that Senedd petitions are considered. But he said that would not happen until at least next March, because the organiser of the petition has not agreed to close the petition early. That means it will remain open for the full six month period. The First Minister was asked by the committee chair, the Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, if he recognised concerns about 20mph zones that he said had been expressed by some of the emergency services. In response, Mark Drakeford said that There are some individual voices in some services that have expressed concern. The services themselves have not and of course we work very closely with them. The rules are no different in a 20 mile an hour road than they are in a 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 mile road. Emergency services are able to travel above the speed limit where there is a case for them to do so. None of that has changed. And I think a number of these concerns are concerns in advance of the facts, when it comes to operating the system on the ground, I do not think that those fears will materialise. Mark Drakeford also told MPs that he does not believe a single penny will be spent on electrifying the main railway line across the north of Wales by the UK Government. In his recent speech to the Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister announced that the northern part of the HS2 rail project would be cancelled and the money saved would be spent on other projects. That included a pledge to spend 1bn on electrification of the North Wales main line. The First Minister was asked by Conservative MP Robin Millar why the Welsh Government had responded to that announcement by saying that electrification was not a priority for Wales. Mark Drakeford said: First of all, the so-called promise unravelled very quickly indeed, when the Secretary of State for Transport in the UK Government said that this was merely an illustrative list, but nobody was to take it as meaning that this was actual money for actual activity. So you know, I do not think a single penny will be spent on this scheme during the lifetime of the current government. As for the issue about whether or not it is a priority the First Minister said that what our Minister pointed to was the joint committee, a committee made up of representatives of the Welsh Government and the UK Government prioritising plans for rail investment in north Wales, but that committee with UK representatives on it had not put electrification of the main line at the top of the list for investment. The announcement was made with no reference to the group that had been established between two governments to draw up priority plans. I am afraid there is very little confidence amongst people in North Wales that this will ever happen because they saw the experience in South Wales which was promised twice that there will be electrification of the mainline and twice that ban was reversed.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Mark Drakeford told MPs that the petition will be responded to in the usual way that Senedd petitions are considered.

Sir John Armitt warned that it would be a mistake to sell the land in a rush after Rishi Sunak betrayed the north by scrapping plans to extend the high speed rail line to Manchester to save cash. Land on the abandoned route north of Birmingham was protected to prevent conflicting developments - but the Department for Transport has now lifted the restrictions. Any property that is no longer required for HS2 will be sold and a programme is being developed to do this, the department said. But Sir John, the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, told the Government it needed a proper consideration about how best we can connect Birmingham and Manchester and give us that improved capacity that we still need. He told the BBC : I think it is a mistake. I think that the land should be kept for at least two or three years to give the opportunity for people to revisit that and look at what can be done within that space and find a more cost-effective solution, not write it off today. I am disappointed because I think it is what we often describe as a sort of knee-jerk, snap reaction. The PM desperately tried to deflect criticism of his decision to axe HS2's northern leg by diverting the 36billion earmarked for the Birmingham to Manchester route to other transport schemes. But his new 'Network North' blueprint included reheated announcements, some completed years earlier and many that are not even in the North. Sir John said a full evaluation was needed to develop it into a well-thought-through, integrated plan for the future. We had an integrated plan a few weeks ago, we have now lost that, he said. There are a number of projects, some of which already existed, some new ones. Let us get those properly turned into a well-thought-through, integrated plan for the future. A Government spokesperson said: Delivering high-quality infrastructure is the foundation of our future growth. Our Network North plan will deliver the transport that matters most to people, and we are adopting a fairer and more pragmatic approach to meeting net zero that supports households and families to make greener choices whilst easing the burdens on working people.

Politicians and community leaders fear many communities will be left stranded and disconnected due to the scaled back timetables and cancellations of these crucial routes. Earlier this month First Cymru confirmed that as a result of reductions in Welsh Government funding, several of its services are being withdrawn, while several others will no longer run as frequently in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire. Among the changed and cancelled services, one service in Neath Port Talbot has been completely withdrawn on weekdays. Neath Port Talbot Council has expressed concern about this, and said it feared further reductions could follow in April, 2024. For residents in Llanelli, the cuts mean that from October 29, the L1, L2 and L3 services have all been cut, the 110 service to Swansea has been withdrawn and the X11 to Swansea is now to run every hour instead of every 30 minutes South Wales West Regional MS Altaf Hussain has reacted to First Cymru cancelling nine services and reducing the frequency of dozens of others throughout the region. He said: I am urging the Welsh Government to rethink its decision to reduce the subsidies for bus services. First Cymru has made it plain that it is these cuts that are the because of decisions to axe or reduce services. Without a subsidy, and with reduced passenger numbers, many services now cost more to operate than the income they receive. I know that Neath Port Talbot Council has lobbied Welsh Government on this and I fully support them. Many people totally rely on buses to get to work, attend health care appointments or for shopping and socialising. Without these services, people will be cut off and isolated. Once a route has ended, it is almost impossible to get it back and people are then forced to use expensive taxis or rely on friends and families. The Welsh Government is doing everything in its power to deter people from using their cars with its 20mph speed limit and to use public transport instead, but they have failed to invest in this. Our train services in Wales, which are run by Welsh Government, are officially classed as the most unreliable in the whole of the UK and now buses are being axed as well. Their transport policy is utterly incoherent and shambolic. Dr Hussain urged the Welsh Labour Government to ensure that the money that will come to Wales as a consequence of the decision to scrap parts of the HS2 rail scheme is used to support bus services as well as fund other improvements. Tom Giffard MS for South Wales West has branded cuts to bus services as reckless. He added: The Welsh Government's decision, which has led to First Cymru deciding to cut bus services in Swansea, shows a blatant disregard for the needs of our community. This move will further isolate residents, many of whom rely on these routes for work, school, medical appointments, and essential shopping. To boost the economy and deliver environmentally friendly public transport, it is vital that the concerns of local residents and businesses are listened to. Llanelli county councillors Michael Cranham and Sean Rees have also raised concern regarding the the L1 service, which goes through their wards of Bigyn and Glanymor, serving the communities of Penyfan, Seaside and Morfa. Cllr Cranham said: Many people in our communities including our elderly, disabled and parents with young children rely on buses to get around. We do fear these cuts to public transport will leave people isolated. We support the ongoing efforts to try and regenerate Llanelli town centre and a crucial aspect of that is accessibility and therefore we feel that these changes are a backward step, as there would be no bus service to and from the town centre in either mid to late afternoon or evening. Councillor Rees said: It is clear many are worried about the impact these cuts will have on their ability to be able to access essential services including hospital and doctors appointments, home to school travel and travel to work. A spokesperson for First Cymru said: It was inevitable that we needed to make changes to our bus network in Cymru when the Welsh government announced the lower levels of support. We recognise the government has had some tough decisions to make as it changes the way it funds bus services. But at the same time, we share the disappointment customers will feel from the knock-on impact that will have on some routes. Following requests from local councils, we have looked at our whole network to see where changes could be made to work within the reduced funding available, and while the majority of services will not be impacted, where we have made changes we have done all we can to save routes, even if this has meant having to reduce frequencies or hours of operation. Regrettably, some services, which are either being served by other routes or have particularly low passenger numbers, will stop operating. We remain committed to getting more people to use the bus, but adequate levels of funding are essential where passenger numbers are below the cost of operating services. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: We have provided the bus industry with more than 200m to support it through the pandemic and beyond. We continue to work with Transport for Wales and local authorities to provide more stable services. Our new bus legislation will set out how we intend to transform the way bus services are planned and delivered in the future.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"First Cymru confirmed that as a result of reductions in Welsh Government funding, several of its services are being withdrawn.

Deep and rapid emission cuts this decade are critical to avoid cataclysmic climate impacts and keep the 1.5C target of the Paris Agreement attainable. The EU's current targeted level of ambition for 2030 remains insufficient and does not reflect its fair contribution to the fight against the climate crisis. Bring forward the EU's climate neutrality target and commit to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 at the latest, with at least 92 gross emission cuts. In light of the advice of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) and the Paris Agreement's equity principles, the EU as a major historic emitter and industrialised economy bears a higher responsibility than the global average in the fight against the climate emergency. The EU should commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest and set climate targets aligned with the 5-year UNFCCC common timeframes agreed at the Glasgow COP, including for 2035. The Commission should make clear in their proposal for a 2040 target how the EU will close the eventual gap between a fair EU GHG budget that meets its responsibilities and a domestic target that takes into account an ambitious emissions pathway. This gap should be closed through additional mitigation measures in the EU and new and additional financial support to developing countries. This support should not result in funds being diverted from climate change adaptation and loss and damage commitments. Protect, restore and enhance Europe's natural carbon sinks, in particular through dedicated and immediate action to revitalise Europe's forests, wetlands, peatlands and agricultural soils at a much larger scale and pace and ensure net removals are additional to - and not used to offset - urgently needed emissions reductions in other sectors. Making Europe's natural sinks more resilient will not only constitute a key pillar in the EU's fight against the climate crisis, but is also essential in protecting and restoring Europe's biodiversity. Sufficient amounts of financing must result in significantly restoring nature across the EU. Step up adaptation to climate change at EU level. Europe is already facing catastrophic consequences of climate change and needs to prepare for adaptation. A binding European law on planned, ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change, grounded in climate justice, is needed. Implementing agro-ecological practices to reduce water consumption and soil degradation in the agricultural sector, greening cities, eliminating concrete surfaces to combat heat islands, and increasing resources dedicated to fire risk management are all effective long-term adaptation measures, which can help to reduce social inequalities. Ensure the EU leads by example for climate justice internationally. Europe needs to deliver on its obligations to the Global South with special attention to least developed countries and small island developing states. The EU should fully honour commitments to providing new and additional international climate finance for mitigation and adaptation, including the collective doubling of adaptation finance by 2025 (based on 2019 levels) in line with its fair share. Public finance contributions should be the focus, with grants and highly concessional finance for mitigation and grants for adaptation prioritised. The EU should also make multi-year pledges at a scale of billions of USD to the new Loss and Damage Fund, and find new revenues from equitable global, EU and national taxes and levies which make big polluters pay for climate damages.Urgent action is needed on debt and tax justice, through significant reform of the IMF and World Bank, debt cancellation, and a UN Tax Convention, to give countries the fiscal space they need for climate and development action. The EU should endorse an inclusive and feminist climate policy as a cornerstone of EU external action and diplomacy. A just approach to international climate action also means making sure its trade policy is supporting rather than contradicting climate and development objectives with trade, financing and investments built around development objectives rather than extraction of raw materials. End the fossil fuel era once and for all. Adopt binding phase-out dates and trajectories to seal the end of the use of coal (by 2030 at the latest), fossil gas (by 2035 at the latest) and fossil oil (by 2040 at the latest). This also necessitates the phase-out of unsustainable and costly technologies such as nuclear power. Ending the reliance on fossil fuels and uranium, which are largely imported, is essential to strengthen the EU's energy resilience, strategic autonomy and security. Put an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies in a socially just manner and stop fossil infrastructure expansion, including for liquefied gas. End the fossil fuel industry's excessive weight on EU and Member States' decision-making processes and stop giving the fossil gas industry another lifeline through ill-considered and inappropriate support for hydrogen. Support for hydrogen should be targeted at hard to electrify sectors only and be produced from additional renewable energy sources. Ensure the EU endorses and supports an international Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. Build a 100 renewable energy system by 2040 with people and nature at its heart. Speed and scale up the deployment of sustainable renewable energy such as wind and solar, and necessary infrastructure, while avoiding new hydropower plants and sources of bioenergy that increase emissions compared to fossil fuels, and ensure renewables provide a share of at least 50 of the EU's energy mix by 2030. Make sure the energy market is strong, resilient, flexible, and people-centred maximising the uptake of variable renewables, demand-side flexibility and electrification, providing affordable energy for all. Empower consumers (households, energy communities, businesses, and small and medium-sized industry) to be on top of their energy production and consumption and optimise the energy demandsupply, fully tapping into the huge benefits in terms of costs, raw material use and land savings from avoiding new infrastructure. Put in place strong support for flexibility measures such as demand side response and storage to ensure the energy system can deal with increasing supply of variable renewable energy. Since local authorities are a key actor in the deployment of renewable energy, European funding needs to be dedicated to local engineering in local authorities and the structures that support them, especially for more human resources and skills. Fully tap into Europe's energy savings potential and adopt EU-wide and national targets to cut energy consumption in half by 2040. Accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency and sufficiency measures in all sectors of the economy and mobilise investments at national, regional and local level to ensure at least 20 energy savings by 2030. Enable a tripling of the renovation rate and a large-scale roll-out of deep renovation for all occupants, a transport modal shift from inefficient aviation to rail and light efficient vehicles, more electric vehicles and the use of more efficient appliances. It will require building on lessons learned to enable structural change and further drastic changes in current production and consumption patterns, including a focus on sufficiency, repair, circularity, recycling, cutting industrial resource use and primary energy demand. Energy savings are key for making Europe independent from energy imports, while helping the economy, leading to more jobs, reducing energy waste, greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills. Advance the just transformation and make the European Green Deal the engine for new jobs. Support local communities of regions dependent on coal and carbon-intensive industries in decline with funds, tools and know-how so they can become prosperous, climate-neutrality oriented and resilient to socio-economic effects of the change. The process needs to be implemented in a transparent and participatory manner, in cooperation with citizens and stakeholders, with the full involvement of trade unions. The European Commission should issue targets and recommendations for qualification and employment in climate-friendly and circular-economy sectors. The Commission and Member States should draw up projections of the upcoming transformation at the regional level, identify potentials for new value-added and employment clusters and assess existing education and training needs. Education and training should be consistently geared towards climate-friendly employment, for example through retraining from automotive to recharging infrastructure, from the aviation to the rail industry, training programmes for the refurbishment of residential buildings, installation of heat pumps and solar panels or employment in the circular economy. Ensure a sustainable and fair natural resources management within and beyond the EU, effectively tackling over-production and over-consumption. Bring back Europe's resource consumption within planetary boundaries and setting ambitious and binding targets to reduce the EU's material footprint and achieve a fully circular economic model throughout all sectors. Ensure due diligence for social, environmental and human rights impacts in critical mineral supply chains, particularly in the Global South. Enhance social protection and cohesion through a redistributive agenda based on the polluter pays principle. Make sure that the costs and benefits of the transition are borne and shared equitably across society, with a greener fiscal system based on the principle that the polluter pays for the full societal harm caused as well as mechanisms to redistribute the costs of the transition fairly. For the transport sector, this entails taxing environmentally harmful fuels at the highest rate in a socially just manner and fully recycling revenues to further enhance climate action, in particular to make sustainable mobility affordable for low income households and massively invest into accelerated expansion of the European rail network. In the agricultural sector, this requires a complete overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards a system where subsidies are strictly linked to sustainable agricultural practices, accelerating an agroecological transition away from industrial agriculture with reduced industrial livestock farming. Increase social resilience and strengthen the increase of dedicated funds enhancing social cohesion and fighting energy poverty, such as the Social Climate Fund, public goods and services for all through policies that enhance the fair redistribution of wealth and resources, sustainability, protection of biodiversity, gender responsiveness, racial equity and societal wellbeing. Align financial flows with the fight against the climate and biodiversity crises. The EU should exclude any possibility of using EU funds for new fossil fuel investments and infrastructure projects in Europe and internationally which increase fossil fuel use. This includes immediately closing all the loopholes that remain in several large EU funding instruments including the Recovery and Resilience Facility and cohesion policy funds and permanently excluding all fossil fuel finance from 2025 onwards. Reform the EU public debt and deficit rules and establish a new EU fund for climate and just transformation to enable the needed investments in the just and green transition. Revise the EU taxonomy to exclude nuclear and gas from green labelling, and regulate private finance to maximise its support to the green transition. Strengthen, protect, resource and support civil society and youth organisations, independent science and research and media across Europe. Protect and expand civic spaces at EU, national and local levels through effective, transparent and timely public participation in policy-making, implementation and expansion of citizens' assemblies and other innovative forms of civic participation at all levels, and firm action against threats or breaches of the rule of law. Ensure meaningful youth participation in formal policy processes and enable young people to design their own future through supporting youth-led initiatives. Strengthen the role of local authorities, citizens and community-led grassroots initiatives in EU decision-making processes and resource them adequately as they are at the forefront of the action against climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Guarantee current and future generations' fundamental rights to a healthy environment, to enjoy a life with dignity and environmental protection. Strengthen citizens' rights to access to justice and improve compliance with environmental and climate obligations at national, EU and international level. Facilitate litigation to hold accountable governments, business and financial institutions for their ongoing investments in fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries and the related human rights effects that such investments can provoke.

The train derailed at KM 5204 at the crossing between Sentolo and Wates stations in Kulon Progo district of Yogyakarta on Tuesday (October 17, 2023). We are coordinating with the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) to investigate the because of the train's derailment, said Didiek Hartantyo, President Director of KAI, in Kulon Progo. KAI has investigated the driver of Argo Semeru train and the driver of Argo Wilis train, which brushed past it soon after the derailment, resulting in both rail tracks getting blocked and both trains suffering damage. Based on a preliminary investigation, the Argo Wilis train driver had time to brake, but the distance was too close, making the accident unavoidable, Hartantyo informed. We do not want to conclude the because of the incident yet. The condition of the train is also roadworthy, and all procedures have been carried out, he added. However, his party is continuing to investigate the because of the Argo Semeru train's derailment. We will continue to investigate this incident and monitor train activity after the incident, he said. Hartantyo said that 32 passengers on the Argo Semeru train needed treatment, while 28 others experienced shock but were sent home later. He added that four passengers were rushed to the hospital. Three of them were already discharged and the other one remained hospitalized due to a head injury. Erni Basri, Director of Railway Safety at the Directorate General of Railways (DJKA) of the Ministry of Transportation, said that she could not provide more details since the investigation was still going on.

Please try again later verifyErrors  Network Rail is failing to prevent safety risks from unacceptable overcrowding at London's Euston station, regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said. Passengers waiting on the station's concourse often surge forwards when information boards reveal what platform their train is departing from. The ORR visited the station last month after analysing CCTV footage of three incidents of concern in the summer, which showed crowding reaching unacceptable levels and a lack of crowd control. There were reports of minor injuries and the potential for more serious consequences, the regulator said. The ORR found that Network Rail, which manages the station, had no recorded, risk-assessed plan for two pinch points where crowding is most concentrated. Some control measures that did exist were found to be inadequate, while signage and layout to assist passenger flows was not of an acceptable standard. The ORR has issued an improvement notice to Network Rail in relation to the station. Ticket restrictions on Britain's railways sometimes mean peak services - such as those in the early morning and late afternoon - are more expensive and less used compared with off-peak services. This can result in overcrowding on off-peak trains at major stations. Simon Bennett, Network Rail's West Coast South route head of stations and passenger experience said: Managing a popular and busy station like Euston is a daily challenge, a challenge that our dedicated cross-industry team rise to each day, always putting passengers' wellbeing and safety at the forefront of their minds. Our team, along with the ORR, want to do more, which is why we have cleared the concourse of shops to make more room for our passengers. We have fitted new state-of-the-art information boards, both inside and outside the station. We are also now trialling earlier boarding of services with our train operating colleagues to help reduce crowding at peak times. The ORR has asked us to look at some other specific areas and our team, along with our train operating colleagues, are already on the case making further improvements. Euston was the UK's fifth busiest railway station in the year to the end of March 2022, with 23.1 million entries and exits.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Passengers waiting on concourse often surge forwards when information boards reveal what platform their train is departing from.

Blast kills hundreds at Gaza hospital; Hamas and Israel trade blame, as Biden heads to Mideast KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Around them in the grass were blankets, school backpacks and other belongings. Outrage over what many believed was an Israeli strike flared across the region, a day before President Joe Biden was due to arrive to show support for Israel and try to prevent the war from spreading. The carnage unfolded as the YOU.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas' deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hamas called Tuesday's hospital blast a horrific massacre, saying it was caused by an Israeli strike. The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often cooperates with Hamas in their shared struggle against Israel. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital at the time and that intelligence from multiple sources indicated it was responsible for the failed rocket launch that hit the hospital. Destruction at Gaza hospital increases stakes for Biden's trip to Israel and Jordan WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's efforts to tamp down tensions in the escalating war between Israel and Hamas faced a bloody setback Tuesday when, shortly before his expected departure for the Middle East, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas withdrew from scheduled meetings to protest an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike but the Israeli military said it had no involvement and pinned the blame on a misfired Palestinian rocket. Abbas' cancellation, disclosed by a senior Palestinian official, reflects an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of American influence in the region as Biden visits Israel and Jordan on Wednesday. Biden's decision to put himself in a conflict zone -- the same year he made a surprise visit to Ukraine -- demonstrates his willingness to take personal and political risks as he becomes heavily invested in another intractable foreign conflict with no clear end game and plenty of opportunity for things to spiral out of control. The high-stakes presidential trip is emblematic of Biden's belief that the United States should not turn back from its central role on the global stage and his faith that personal diplomacy can play a decisive role. War between Israel and Hamas raises fears about rising US hostility A fatal stabbing in Illinois, a gun pointed at protesters in Pennsylvania, vandalism at synagogues and harassment of staff at a Palestinian restaurant all are raising fears that the war between Israel and Hamas is sparking violence in the United States. The tensions follow a familiar pattern of crimes against Jewish and Muslim communities rising when conflict erupts in the Middle East and Americans have been killed or taken hostage. We have a two pronged threat to American faith communities, said Brian Levin, founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernadino. While it is too soon to say with certainty whether anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish crimes have increased during the war, hate crimes overall increased in the YOU.S. last year. In its annual report released Monday, the FBI estimated that hate crimes increased by 7 to 11,634 cases in 2022 compared to the previous year. With 1,124 incidents, anti-Jewish attacks were the second most reported hate crime, after anti-Black cases. There were 158 reported incidents of anti-Muslim attacks, and 92 reports of anti-Arab cases, according to the report. Civil rights organizations, however, believe that even before the Hamas attacks in Israel, crime data did not reflect reality due to a lack of participation by local police departments and internalized fear among the Muslim population, said Robert McCaw, director of governmental affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In 2021, the Othering  Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, released a study in which 85 of those who were subjected to Islamophobia said they did not report it to authorities. Republicans reject Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot, signaling more turmoil ahead WASHINGTON (AP) -- More turmoil ahead, Republicans rejected Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot Tuesday, as an unexpectedly numerous 20 holdouts denied the hard-charging ally of Donald Trump the GOP majority needed to seize the gavel. Additional voting was postponed as the House hit a standstill, stuck while Jordan works to shore up support from Republican colleagues to replace the ousted Kevin McCarthy for the job. Reluctant Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. Next votes were expected Wednesday. We are going to keep working, Jordan said at the Capitol as evening fell. It is been two weeks of angry Republican infighting since McCarthy's sudden removal by hard-liners, who are now within reach of a central seat of YOU.S. power. The vote for House speaker, once a formality in Congress, has devolved into another bitter showdown for the gavel. Jordan said after the first vote that he was not surprised and expected to do better in the next round. But the afternoon dragged on with no further votes Tuesday. Trump returns to his civil fraud trial, hears an employee and an appraiser testify against him NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump returned Tuesday to the civil fraud trial that imperils his real estate empire, watching and deploring the case as an employee and an outside appraiser testified that his company essentially put a thumb on the scale when sizing up his properties' value. Incensed by a case that disputes his net worth and could strip him of such signature holdings as Trump Tower, the former president is due to testify later in the trial. But he chose to attend the first three days and came back Tuesday to observe -- and to protest his treatment to the news cameras waiting outside the Manhattan courtroom. Star witness Michael Cohen, a onetime Trump fixer now turned foe, postponed his scheduled testimony because of a health problem. Instead, Trump company accountant Donna Kidder testified that she was told to make some assumptions favorable to the firm on internal financial spreadsheets. Outside appraiser Doug Larson said he did not suggest or condone a former Trump Organization comptroller's methods of valuing properties. It does not make sense, Larson said of the way the ex-controller reached a 287.6 million value for a prominent Trump-owned retail space in 2013. Ukraine uses US-provided long-range ATACMS missiles against Russian forces for the first time WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has quietly delivered a small number of long-range ballistic missiles that Ukraine said it urgently needed and that President Joe Biden promised last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Tuesday, saying they were used on the battlefield against Russia and executed very accurately. Today I express special gratitude to the United States, Zelenskyy said in his evening address, adding that the missiles have proven themselves. The YOU.S. has refused to discuss the delivery publicly, but officials familiar with the move also confirmed it earlier in the day. Fewer than a dozen of the missiles got into Ukraine within the last few days, said officials. Their arrival at the warfront gives Ukraine a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before an official announcement and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The delivery of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, was shrouded in secrecy, with the expectation that the first public acknowledgment would come when the missiles were used on the battlefield. That intense secrecy is a marked change from previous YOU.S. weapons sent by the Biden administration. In nearly all other cases, the YOU.S. has publicly announced its decision prior to the weapons and equipment being shipped overseas. Because of lingering YOU.S. concerns about escalating tensions with Russia, the ATACMS version that went to Ukraine will have a shorter range than the maximum distance the missiles can have. While some versions of the missiles can go as far as about 180 miles (about 300 kilometers), the ones sent to Ukraine have a shorter range and carry cluster munitions, which, when fired, open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead. According to a YOU.S. official, the ones delivered to Ukraine have a maximum range of a bit more than 100 miles (roughly 160 kilometers). Belgian police kill Tunisian man suspected of shooting 3 Swedish soccer fans, killing 2 of them BRUSSELS (AP) -- Authorities in the Belgian capital shot and killed a Tunisian national on Tuesday hours after they say he gunned down three Swedish soccer fans, killing two of them, and posted a video online in which he claimed credit for the attack and said the Quran was a red line for which he is ready to sacrifice himself. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive for Monday night's attack, which happened not far from where Belgium's men's soccer team was hosting Sweden in a European Championships qualifier. The match was suspended at halftime and the more than 35,000 fans were kept inside the stadium as a precaution while the attacker was at large. Amateur videos of the attack posted on social media showed a man wearing an orange fluorescent vest pull up on a scooter, take out a large weapon and open fire on people getting out of a taxi. He chased them into a building to gun them down. He was also filmed calmly loading his weapon as cars drove by slowly. Sweden's foreign ministry said the men who were killed were in their 60s and 70s, and the man who was wounded is in his 70s and remains hospitalized. Hours after the suspect disappeared into the night and a manhunt was launched, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap Are 3D mammograms better than standard 2D imaging for catching advanced cancers? A clinical trial is recruiting thousands of volunteers -- including a large number of Black women who face disparities in breast cancer death rates -- to try to find out. People like Carole Stovall, a psychologist in Washington, D.C., have signed up for the study to help answer the question. We all need a mammogram anyway, so why not do it with a study that allows the scientists to understand more and move closer to finding better treatments and ways of maybe even preventing it? Stovall said. The underrepresentation of women and minorities in research is a long-simmering issue affecting health problems including Alzheimer's disease, stroke and COVID-19. Trials without diversity lead to gaps in understanding of how new treatments work for all people. Broken rail caused fatal Colorado train derailment that collapsed bridge, early findings show A broken rail caused a train derailment that collapsed a bridge over an interstate highway in Colorado, killing a truck driver and blocking the road for days, federal authorities said Tuesday, based on their preliminary investigation. Officials will investigate how the rail broke and why warning systems did not alert crews to the condition of the track, the National Transportation Safety Board said. An agency spokesperson said officials had no reason to believe sabotage caused the derailment. The steel bridge, built in 1958, collapsed Sunday when 30 cars from a BNSF Railway train hauling coal derailed while crossing over Interstate 25 north of Pueblo. The driver of a semitrailer truck passing beneath the bridge was killed. I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, is expected to remain closed for several more days as crews clear away coal and other debris. Broken rails and other track problems are a leading because of derailments, according to federal accident data. Prosecutors seeking to recharge Alec Baldwin in fatal shooting on set of Western movie 'Rust' SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Special prosecutors are seeking to recharge actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie in 2021, describing Tuesday their preparations to present new information to a grand jury. New Mexico-based prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said they will present their case to the grand jury within the next two months, noting additional facts have come to light in the shooting on the set of the film Rust that killed Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin, a coproducer of the film, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a rustic chapel on a movie-set ranch near Santa Fe when the gun went off on October 21, 2021, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza. Additional facts have come to light that we believe show Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza, Morrissey and Lewis said in an email.

The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital's grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Outrage over what many believed was an Israeli strike flared across the region, a day before President Joe Biden was due to arrive to show support for Israel.","{'BART': {'other news': 0.3841574192047119, 'personal or small scale isolated event and news': 0.18347227573394775, 'general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends': 0.16063183546066284, 'warehouse and storage facilities disruption or destruction news': 0.0919201448559761, 'severe and extreme weather news ': 0.06238493323326111, 'major maritime transportation disruption news': 0.04366672784090042, 'major railway transportation disruption news': 0.0408245325088501, 'major air transportation disruption news': 0.025015177205204964, 'major and large scale worker strike actions': 0.007926949299871922}}",other news,personal or small scale isolated event and news

John Rutherford's (R) Florida district while he was opposing Rep. Jim Jordan's (R-OH) Speakership bid in Washington D.C. The brazen late-morning shooting occurred on Interstate 95 near the World Golf Village in Florida's 5th district on Tuesday, causing a shutdown. Per News4Jax: According to the Sheriff's Office, suspects who were riding in the red car opened fire on a victim's vehicle on the interstate around 11:20 a.m. on Tuesday. The victim, who was driving, was struck by the gunfire and crashed into the center guard rail and a female passenger had glass-break injuries. Both were transported to local hospitals but their conditions are unknown. The red car sped off southbound and has not been found, the Sheriff's Office said.A white Mercedes was seen at the scene of the shooting surrounded by law enforcement vehicles including a forensics van. The highway's southbound lanes in the vicinity of World Golf Village were shut down until it later reopened. Rescue vehicles and over a half a dozen police cars were seen amid the pileup around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. As Breitbart News reported, Jim Jordan was denied the Speaker of the House gavel on Tuesday due to 20 Republican holdouts, including John Rutherford. The six Republican holdouts voting for Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Mike Lawler (R-NY), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-NE), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) and Don Bacon (R-NE). McCarthy has endorsed Jordan and voted for him, said the report. The seven Republicans voting for Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) were Reps. Steve Womack (R-AR), Mike Simpson (R-ID), John Rutherford (R-FL), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Tony Gonzales (R-TX), Kay Granger (R-TX), and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL). Scalise withdrew from the race last week after failing to see a path to victory. He, too, voted for Jordan, it added. Democrats have largely celebrated the holdouts as a delay of Jordan's speakership bid. A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier and an insurrection insider to the Speaker of this house would be a terrible message to the country and our allies, said Rep. Pete Aguilar (R-CA).",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The brazen late-morning shooting occurred on Interstate 95 near the World Golf Village in Florida's 5th district on Tuesday, causing a shutdown.

Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit vital military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear programme. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby said, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name. In return for support, we assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, or other materials and other advanced technologies. The US unveiled the intelligence determination as North Korea lashed out Friday at the arrival of a US aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it a provocation and again raising the spectre of using nuclear weapons to defend itself. The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the aircraft carrier's arrival an undisguised military provocation that proves a US plan to attack North Korea is being realized. It threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The US has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, last week published satellite photos that showed a sharp increase in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border, The report said satellite images as of October 5 captured a dramatic and unprecedented level of freight railcar traffic at the Tumangang Rail Facility. It said images show approximately 73 railcars while a review of previous satellite images over the past five years shows about 20 railcars at this facility at most. Kim last month, after he had met with Putin, called for an exponential increase in the production of nuclear weapons and for his country to play a larger role in a coalition of nations confronting the United States in a new Cold War, North Korean state media said. During Kim's six-day trip to Russia, his longest foreign travel as a leader, the two countries said they discussed boosting their defence ties but did not disclose any specific steps. Foreign experts speculate the two countries, both locked in confrontations with the West, were pushing to reach arms transfer deals in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The trip to Russia was also Kim's first foreign trip since the pandemic, during which North Korea imposed tight border controls for more than three years. After decades of hot-and-cold relations, Russia and North Korea have drawn closer since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipments have been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East to consult with allies in the aftermath of last week's Hamas attack on Israel, spoke by phone on Friday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken and Kuleba discussed the latest battlefield developments, according to the State Department.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"North Korea has delivered more than 1000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine.

While civic officials claimed that it is leading to cost escalation and may delay the flyover project, a Metro official said one report has been submitted and others will follow in a phased manner. The PMC has undertaken the construction of the flyover -- from Rajaram Bridge to Fun Time Cinema -- to decongest the road, which is notorious for traffic jams and accidents. A total of 39 pillars of MahaMetro are coming up in the descents after the flyover. It has not submitted the report on the design of these pillars even after repeated requests. Due to this, the work of the flyover is getting delayed, Ajay Vaise, executive engineer, PMC, told Mirror. Sources in the civic body said the flyover project cost is escalating by Rs 1 crore per month due to the delay in submission of the report by the rail authorities. MahaMetro executive director Hemant Sonawane refuted the claims. We have submitted reports on the design of 12 out of 39 pillars to the PMC. The reports on the design of other pillars will be submitted in a phased manner. We are cooperating with the civic body, he told Mirror. The sources in the civic body said: Metro poles up to a height of one meter from the ground will be constructed on the routes where the flyover ends. On November 21 last year, the PMC had requested for the plan from MahaMetro as to where and how these pillars would be. After repeated follow-up, a report on the design of these pillars was given in the beginning of September this year, the sources in the civic body said. A joint meeting of PMC and MahaMetro officials was held on September 27. At that time, it came to light that the report on the structure of the pillars submitted by metro authorities was given without underground investigation. Since then, the civic body has been following up for the revised report. The construction of the flyover is being delayed due to a lack of roads to the landing site of the flyover. The material for the flyover construction is currently being taken to the bridge with the help of a lift. The flyover is scheduled for completion by March 2024, and the work is being done at 80 percent capacity, claimed the officials.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Pune Municipal Corporation has expressed its displeasure over MahaMetro's failure to submit the design report for the construction of pillars on Sinhagad Road, where a flyover is being constructed.

The evacuation team is already deployed to evacuate and ensure the passengers' safety. They are also coordinating to bring in a series of heavy equipment and supporting locomotives to evacuate the affected facilities, the ministry's director general of railways, Risal Wasal, informed in a statement released on Tuesday. To evacuate the affected passengers, a series of extraordinary trains (KLB) have been sent from Yogyakarta, he informed. The Directorate General of Railways (DJKA) is coordinating intensively with the emergency response team to ensure there are no victims, Wasal said. At the same time, we will investigate and explore the chronology of the incident to immediately take further steps to handle it, he added. The ministry has also expressed concern over the derailment involving the Argo Semeru train series bearing the registration number KA 17 on the Surabaya Gubeng-Gambir route. The incident took place at the intersection between Sentolo and Wates stations, Km 5204, on Tuesday at 1:15 p.m. local time. Ten minutes later, an Argo Wilis train came from the west and brushed past the Argo Semeru train, resulting in both rail tracks getting blocked. The carriages of the two trains were damaged and not fit to continue the trip. As per the latest data from the ministry, three passengers suffered minor injuries in the accident and were attended to by officials from state-owned railway company PT KAI's Operational Regional (Daop) 6 Yogyakarta. There were no casualties. PT KAI's next efforts include evacuating passengers from the two trains and repairing the damaged rail tracks. For trains running through the Wates-Sentolo area, KAI will devise an operational pattern in the form of detours and transfers to different trains or buses.

Whether it is through interactions with guests, or by offering his personal take on a story, Madeley is known to audiences for expressing himself in an unfiltered manner. Viewers are quick to share their thoughts on Madeley's most eyebrow-raising moments on social media. Here is a rundown of his most controversial moments so far. 'Appalling' discussions on Israel-Hamas war Madeley sparked intense backlash on social media on 17 October, when he asked a British-Palestinian Liberal Democrat MP if she had any indication of Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel before it unfolded. Hamas's shock attack on 7 October killed more than 1,300 Israelis, as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore vengeance on the militant group. Israel has retaliated with relentless airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas, killing more than 2,750 Palestinians as of Monday (16 October). The Lib-Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the escalating conflict in the Middle East. GMB viewers accused Madeley of appalling behaviour when he asked Moran: With your family connections in Gaza, did you have any indication of what was going to happen 10 days ago ... was there any word on the street? Moran appeared taken aback by Madeley's question before replying she was as surprised by the attack as anyone else. Audiences called for Madeley to apologise to Moran or be taken off-air, one day after he compared civilian deaths in Gaza to those in Nazi Germany. During a GMB episode on Monday, he asked his co-host Susanna Reid if it was fair to draw a parallel between the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, with those of German civilians during the Second World War. Not just the holocaust, but with what the allies, the British, the free French did when they invaded Europe in 1944 and defeated the Nazis by going into Germany and in doing so, by going into Germany, apart from the bombing campaigns that the RAF and the American airforce launched, lots of German civilians were killed, Madeley said. Comparing climate activists to paedophiles Madeley's most recent moment of controversy took place on 28 March during a conversation about the decision of a group of Britain's top lawyers to refuse to prosecute climate activists. If these people, these barristers and lawyers, have announced they will not prosecute - they simply will not even get started in a court of law - someone who has glued themselves to the road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest, are they still happy to defend, say, a paedophile? Madeley asked. Some viewers expressed their disdain for his comments online, with one writing: Note to Richard Madeley - if you do not have anything sensible to say please do not say anything. Madeley was passionate in his questioning of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) leader, and pressed Lynch on the timing of the strikes. Why could not you have put all these strikes in January? Madeley asked Lynch. Why do you have to target people at Christmas? You will be putting people out of business who run hotels, who run restaurants, who run bars, and retail. Well, we are not targeting Christmas, Lynch replied. It is not Christmas yet, Richard. I do not know when your Christmas starts, but mine starts on Christmas Eve. Viewers were less than impressed with Madeley's conduct in the conversation, with one online commenter tweeting: Richard Madeley needs to calm down and let other people speak. A lot of the public stand with the rail strikers and nurses etc. Shamima Begum and Hitler Youth comments During a discussion on whether former Isis bride Shamima Begum should be allowed to return to the country, Madeley went off on a tangent about the Second World War. Obviously, we had the Nuremberg trials after the war and we hanged quite a few Nazis and imprisoned a lot of others and we let them out eventually. But we did not go after the Hitler Youth as far as I am aware. We did not go after the Hitler Youth - we only went after adults who served in the Hitler regime. And that is something to reflect on, I think. Susanna Reid appeared to be baffled by her co-host's reflections, and it led to some viewers comparing him to Alan Partridge, Steve Coogan's bumbling broadcaster character. Debating with Dr Hilary about Covid lockdown restrictions In July 2021, Madeley clashed opinions with Dr Hilary Jones, a longtime contributor to the programme, over their differing views on lockdown restrictions. The GP claimed that the UK should take rising Covid-19 cases more seriously - as Australia was at the time - rather than abandoning restrictions altogether. However, Madeley opposed Dr Jones's caution, telling him: But we have the vaccine and Australia has not. When Hilary explained that vaccines did not provide 100 per cent protection, Madeley said that he was being misleading.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Madeley has been a co-anchor on Good Morning Britain since 2017.

The military said its forces had carried out well-aimed strikes on enemy airfields near the eastern city of Luhansk and the southern city of Berdiansk but gave few details. It did not comment on media reports that Kyiv had used YOU.S.-provided ATACMS long-range missiles for the first time in the attacks. Ukrainian Special Forces said nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher and other equipment had been destroyed, runways had been hit, and heavy losses had been inflicted on Russian forces. Russia's Defence Ministry did not mention the attacks. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region which is partly controlled by Moscow, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defences had ensured the attack on the Berdiansk airfield was not successful. But a number of Russian military bloggers reported the attacks, and the Russian Telegram channel Fighterbomber said Russian forces had suffered losses of personnel and equipment in strikes carried out with ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems). Citing two unidentified YOU.S. officials, CNN said Washington had secretly delivered ATACMS to Kyiv and the Wall Street Journal said Ukraine had fired the ATACMS at Russian forces for the first time on Tuesday. Kyiv has been seeking the missiles to enhance its ability to attack supply lines, air bases and rail networks in Russian-occupied territory but has not confirmed receiving them. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made no direct mention of the overnight attacks but said after meeting military chiefs: Thanks also to those who powerfully destroy the logistics and bases of the occupiers on our land. There are results. I thank some of our partners: effective weapons, as we agreed, he said. UKRAINIAN COUNTEROFFENSIVE Since starting a counteroffensive in early June, Kyiv has frequently attacked military targets in areas Russian forces occupy in Ukraine. The counteroffensive has made only gradual gains through vast Russian minefields and heavily entrenched Russian positions, and Kyiv says Moscow is attacking in some areas ahead of the second winter since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter, and that fighting continued around the town of Avdiivka on the eastern front. Kyiv says its forces are holding their ground, including around Avdiivka and Kupiansk. The Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, said in its latest report on the conflict that Moscow had made only limited gains in the area around Avdiivka and that the pace of its advance there had slowed.

As representatives of 130 countries gather for a summit in Beijing to mark a decade of the project, AFP looks at some of the key issues surrounding the massive infrastructure project: - Debt, opaque costs - The Belt and Road is a landmark project in President Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas, with Beijing saying it has now inked over two trillion dollars in contracts around the world. Its most high-profile projects have laid down high-speed rail tracks crisscrossing South East Asia and massive transport, energy and infrastructure works through Central Asia. But the flip side of the massive infrastructure spending is the huge debts incurred by participating countries. China said this month that BRI participants owe more than 300 billion to the Export-Import Bank of China. And BRI nations were hit especially hard during the Covid-19 pandemic as soaring inflation and interest rates hurt their ability to repay debts. Critics have also pointed to opaque pricing for the projects built by Chinese companies, with countries including Malaysia and Myanmar renegotiating BRI deals to bring down costs. Residents of BRI nations have also complained that the majority of jobs at infrastructure projects are being done by Chinese workers who send their wages home rather than spend them in local businesses. China has been forced to hand out billions of dollars in bailout loans to BRI countries in recent years to allow the countries to extend their loans and remain solvent, according to a joint report this year by the World Bank and other institutions. - Chinese influence - The BRI has functioned as a diplomatic vehicle burnishing China's image as leader of the global South, while giving Chinese infrastructure firms a foothold in many emerging economies. That has fueled concerns, especially among Western nations, that China is seeking to rebuild the global world order to its advantage, while opposition voices in BRI countries have also decried what they see as increasing Chinese influence in local politics. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that China could use the initiative as a pretext to build up military bases around the world in the name of protecting BRI investments. - Environmental concerns - The initiative has also drawn scrutiny for its massive carbon footprint and the environmental degradation caused by massive infrastructure projects. The development of megaports, pipelines, railways and highways could render the Paris climate goals unreachable, researchers from China, the United States and the United Kingdom warned in 2019. Meanwhile, a report by experts at Boston University's Global Development Policy warned that Chinese-led hard infrastructure projects carry higher risks to indigenous lands and ecosystems due to the country's relative newcomer status in global development finance and its early stages of developing environmental and social risk management due diligence policies and procedures. China has sought to allay environmental fears, promising in 2021 not to build new coal power plants abroad, though many previously agreed projects are still in progress. - Economic benefits - China argues that the BRI brings high-quality development to partner countries -- insisting that while Western projects offer only short-term aid to the Global South, Beijing provides for long-term opportunities with lasting impact. The Boston University researchers noted the BRI's role in providing additional resources for the Global South and fostering significant economic growth. Chinese overseas development finance has been much more focused on industrial and infrastructure lending, they said. Chinese finance is thus more associated with economic growth, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and increased energy access. The World Bank has also said that BRI transport projects -- including railway lines and highways -- substantially improve trade, foreign investment, and living conditions for citizens in participating countries. BRI transport projects, if fully implemented, could raise global income by 0.7 to 2.9 percent, the World Bank estimates.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,Belt and Road Initiative has been criticised for saddling poor countries with enormous debt and causing environmental harm.

The election loss has been described in the media over the weekend as a bloodbath, horror show, utter devastation, a loss of biblical proportions, and a historic defeat. What are leftwing and progressive commentators saying about what went wrong and what Labour now needs to do? Labour's forgotten working class traditions Former Alliance president Matt McCarten, who was Labour's Chief of Staff under David Cunliffe and Andrew Little, is scathing about the current state of the Labour party, describing the party as disconnected from its voters, especially the poor and working class. McCarten told Newsroom's Aaron Smale that Labour has been taken over by middle class people and concerns: They look down on the working class. 'We love the poor, but they smell.' Because they are not part of them. They are in the leafy suburbs, the hip suburbs, the Grey Lynns of this world. And they do not live amongst the working class, they are not of them. They are missionaries. That is what Labour does, 'we do nice things for people. But we do not rock the establishment, we do not rock the middle classes. We keep them quiet'. According to McCarten, the Labour Party reflects a global tendency for leftwing political movements to eschew the working class in favour of managerialism and social issues, which means it can no longer articulate the problems and solutions of ordinary people. He says from the Helen Clark era onwards, the best Labour has been able to offer is to manage capitalism better than National and be nicer: They are not visionaries, they are just nice people. Well fck that, when you are poor, you do not care if they are nice or not nice. You just want hope. Leftwing political commentator Josie Pagani agrees, writing in the Post that Labour has lost its class focus: The priorities of traditional Labour supporters, working people on low incomes, were put lower on the agenda than the priorities of the urban middle class. Jacinda Ardern was willing to spend 678 million to subsidise businesses to decarbonise, for example, but said free dental care, at roughly the same cost, was an unaffordable dream. She argues Labour can no longer be identified with any great causes. Similarly, leftwing political writer Max Rashbrooke tweeted in the weekend that Labour has lost its identity and purpose, and this was a problem before the party won power in 2017: Labour did not have a clear set of priorities or a coherent view of the world it wanted. Had not done the work in opposition; and like global counterparts, unsure what being 'Labour' means now. As a result, Rashbrooke says Labour does not focus enough on the needs of working people: The failure to do anything meaningful on the colossal modern issue of insecure work - even though helping 'labour' is literally in the name - is especially striking and speaks to a long term failure of nerve, vision and willingness to shift the narrative on key issues. Priorities were never clear, except when they really dug in on something - like 3 Waters - and people went, 'Oh, so that is a priority. Who knew?' He says the Labour needs a deep rethink of its core ideology, strategy and policies. A failure to focus on economics Labour's disconnect from the importance of the economy and people's day-to-day struggles was epitomised by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's insistence that no cost of living crisis was occurring under her watch. By the time the election rolled around, it became all about the state of the economy and living standards and, according to Listener writer Danyl Mclauchlan, Labour never managed to grasp this: After promising to focus on the cost of living, Labour delivered piecemeal handouts - subscription subsidies, the GST exemption - which were more than cancelled out by their increases in fuel taxes. In a campaign in which the nation demanded change, Hipkins promised stasis. The Spinoff's Hayden Donnell also cites Hipkins' decision to reject radical tax reform for Labour's demise: Hipkins' 'captain's call' sealed off election opportunities for Labour.... Without real tax relief to offer people on lower incomes, Hipkins became a salesman with nothing to sell. And Donnell says that this was a real problem during a cost of living crisis: When it came time to present his alternative, Hipkins could only offer 45c off parsnips and some free dental for some people in three years' time. Leftwing political commentator Gordon Campbell also singles out Labour's weak economic policies as one of the main reasons the public lost faith in the government. In his column he argues the 2020 administration had a mandate to carry out the radical left wing surgery that the country's various ills required. Campbell lists what this might have looked like: A more radical agenda could have included a capital gains tax, a wealth tax, meaningful anti-trust action against the virtual cartels being run by banks and supermarkets, a windfall tax on their profits, making Working for Families income supports available to beneficiary families, funding Kiwibank so that it can compete significantly with the Aussie banks etc etc. Constitutional and co-governance reform If Labour was less focused on traditional leftwing, economic or working class concerns, then what has been the party's reform programme while in government? Some critics on the left have identified co-governance and related decolonisation agendas as filling the void in Labour's reform agenda, arguing that Labour's Mori caucus became increasingly dominant in the government and determined to deliver a radicalism that would help retain their seats from the revived Te Pati Mori. For example, writing for the Interest website, Chris Trotter paints a picture of the 2017-2023 government being equally as radical as David Lange's Fourth Labour Government, and having now been punished in a similar way to the 1990s when Labour's vote plummeted and even Phil Goff lost his Mt Roskill seat to National. But whereas the LangeDouglas Government was radical in terms of a rightwing economics programme, Trotter suggests the ArdernHipkins Government was radical in terms of wholesale constitutional reform and co-governance in particular - that were growing out of the Crown's newfound commitment to 'indigenisation' and 'decolonisation'. Trotter argues that Labour never managed - or even tried - to take the public along with its big reforms, seeking to suppress debate rather than openly communicate their changes: Massive changes in education and health policy were introduced without adequate explanation or justification. Jarring changes in the linguistic structure of official communications were implemented without consultation, leaving many New Zealanders feeling culturally disoriented and politically ignored. Although the Herald's Simon Wilson supports co-governance, he also blames Labour's approach to implementing this policy, saying good people felt estranged by co-governance. As with many of its other reforms, Wilson suggests that Labour did so in a top-down way, failing to take communities with them. Covid-19 and conservatism Wilson wrote that Covid-19 was partly responsible for Labour's demise, as the pandemic's hangover lingered: The social trauma has been far deeper and more widespread than expected. And he also blames Hipkins for not being bolder: He failed to grasp that voters who want change actually do want change and will not settle for trivialities. GST off the veges, but no structural tax reform? Was it a joke? Nope. It was a betrayal. Wilson also makes the very good point that Labour's fear of boldness and change was actually self-defeating, because voters did want action: Labour was scared of change. One of the great fallacies in politics is that there is a big middle ground of voters who like quiet moderation. Actually, voters want things to be better. Those who swing from one party to another are not looking to reinforce the status quo. They have become disillusioned and want a shake-up. Progressive business journalist Bernard Hickey argues that Labour's loss came from its desire to go into government promising great transformation that could not be delivered by remaining economically orthodox: Labour lost the 2023 election in 2017 when it committed to the Budget Responsibility Rules, while also committing to 100,000 Kiwibuild homes, the Auckland CBD-Airport rail line, welfare reform and a capital gains tax review. They were incompatible and the inevitable disappointment upon failing on Kiwibuild, light rail, and welfare reform. He believes that the government's Covid response was an additional factor in its demise: The revolt against government over the Covid restrictions in late 2021 punctured that 2020 election bubble. Listener writer Danyl Mclauchlan also cites Covid and failure to deliver on promises: Hipkins was indirectly responsible for much of his party's decline. He was minister for Covid, and the early phase was a triumph that voters rewarded in 2020. But 2021 saw one of the slowest vaccine rollouts in the OECD after the government failed to negotiate purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies. The lack of vaccine coverage led to the sustained Auckland lockdown of late 2021, a policy failure that the nation's largest city has punished them for by delivering a number of Labour's safest seats to National. Mt Roskill and New Lynn have fallen, Mt Albert and Te Atat look set to fall. Hipkins was also minister for health, education, police and public service: all areas in which his government's legacy is questionable at best. What happens next for Labour? It is clear that Labour now needs to do a lot of soul-searching, or even to rediscover its political and ideological soul. Unfortunately, the Labour caucus is rather lacking in personnel at the moment who might achieve this. Gordon Campbell argues that Hipkins' replacement cannot be Grant Robertson, who is not only past his 'use by' date, but has been more part of the problem than part of the solution, starting with his decision to bind Labour to Blairite budget constraints. He nominates David Parker as the best option among Labour's surviving roster of senior MPs who might have the will and the ability to shift Labour back in the leftwards direction necessary, and he is the only potential leader able to sort out Labour's pressing existential problem of deciding what its purpose is. Other leadership options currently being talked about include Carmel Sepuloni, Peeni Henare, and Barbara Edmonds. Whoever is chosen, Campbell recommends that they keep away from the lobbyists, businesspeople, and focus groups Labour has relied upon so heavily for the last six years in power. Only then will Labour be able to reconnect with its traditional values. Simon Wilson says Labour faces the existential question: What is the point of Labour in the 2020s? He suggests the problem is that the party is against change, and unfortunately, the political right has now claimed the role of giving optimism and hope to ordinary people. According to Josie Pagani, Labour needs significant renewal, and to reach outside the party for debate and ideas - something she says the party has not done for a long time. Finally, she offers the following example of how complacency can be fatal: The French Socialist party is a salutary reminder of the alternative. After many decades in and out of government, the party cratered on just 1.75 percent of the vote in 2022. Parties that do not change sometimes disappear.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Former Alliance president Matt McCarten is scathing about the current state of the Labour party.

The PJ Media Slack channel lit up over the weekend with Twitter images of what was purported to be Israel's Iron Beam defense system in action, shooting down at least two incoming projectiles. But when I finally got around to checking Slack on Sunday night, every single tweet featuring Iron Beam had been deleted. Apparently, internet pranksters had again used videos generated by the Arma 3 platform to fool Twitter into believing that Iron Beam was already in use. While that does not appear to be the case, at least not yet, various sources report that Israel is working furiously on their close-in air defense system as the Hamas War rages on in the Gaza Strip. But about that name... Iron Dome is Israel's well-known and fully operational missile defense system. Unlike America's various ballistic missile defense, designed to shoot down small numbers of nuclear-tipped missiles incoming from China, Russia, or some rogue state like North Korea or Iran, Iron Dome is a strictly local affair. In service since 2011, Iron Dome is a truck-towed, mobile air defense system whose primary job is shooting down Hamas and Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israeli cities. The problem with Iron Dome is that while homemade missiles like Hamas and Hezbollah use are inexpensive, antimissile missiles run up to 150,000 a pop, and each missile battery costs about 50 million to manufacture. The costs do not exactly work in Jerusalem's favor. ASIDE: For the record, MTG never used the phrase Jewish space lasers. But, before she was elected to Congress, she did once share on Facebook a rumor about the possibility that secret lasers controlled by the Rothschilds -- intended to clear land for then-Gov. Jerry Brown's high-speed rail project -- had started a series of deadly wildfires. I have no room to criticize because my entire Twitter feed is one disqualification from public office after another. Enter, Israelis with fricken laser beams. Iron Beam is a: 100kW class High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS). It is designed to intercept a wide range of threats such as Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM) and UAVs. Israeli defense firm Rafael revealed Iron Beam at the Singapore Airshow in 2014. Its job is to defend at ranges too short for Iron Dome -- and for a lot less money, too. Firing a laser beam and an incoming projectile costs just 2,000. Cheap at twice the price! Just a year ago, Defense News reported that deployment had slipped to at least 2024, maybe 2025. Could Rafael speed things up in time for use during the current conflict? Rafael exec Michael Lurie told Defense News back then, We do not have a technology problem or a scientific problem anymore... it is now an engineering problem. Maybe they have rushed things along enough over the last 12 months to produce a working prototype but I would not bet money on that I could not afford to lose. But I would wager a mortgage payment that the IDF has at least one working battery in time for the next major war. What does it all mean? It means that Israel is taking one more step towards fulfilling the prophecy of the great Mel Brooks.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Israel's development of real-world antimissile lasers is accelerating to ludicrous speed.

Awareness to the bedbug crisis was first raised last week as it emerged the French were experiencing a 'living hell' fighting off a plague of the insects that feed on the blood of animals and humans. But this week, Sadiq Khan warned that the possibility of bedbugs on London's public transport was a 'real source of concern' and that he had contacted officials in Paris after the French capital became overwhelmed by an outbreak with the insects reported in schools, trains, hospitals and cinemas. Now, a pest control company which operates in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and London has said that staff are facing 25 call-outs a week, which is up from just 'one or two' a month ago. Luton is a particular hotspot for bedbugs at the moment, with residents throwing their beds away, ripping up carpets and evacuating their homes. A bedbug is seen on a glove of a biocide technician from Hygiene Premium in Paris on September 29 Fears are growing of a bedbug outbreak in the UK - similar to that seen in France over recent weeks.

The Pest Control Service is currently receiving an alarming number of bed bug jobs on a weekly basis.' Adam Warren, director of Summit Pest Control, told The Times that the problem had flared up in the past six weeks and that Luton was 'busier for bedbugs than I have ever known it'. As the company face a busy time of year, they said the worst infestation was in the affluent village of Radlett, Hertfordshire, where an elderly couple's house was so infested they had to rip out the carpets and throw the beds away. The Times also spoke to Jamie Ramsey, manager of Pests of London, who said they were 'snowed under' with bedbug call-outs at the moment. They serve areas within the M25. The company's call-outs have doubled since last year to around five to ten a day - many from hotels concerned that guests were bringing them to rooms. A third firm, Pest Extractors, said they have seen a recent spike too - not just in Luton but all over, including Stevenage, another hotspot. The spike comes as it has also emerged that insurers will not pay out over bedbug infestations. Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, and other firms who provide home cover have confirmed the cost of removing bedbugs or repairing damage is not included in most policies. The Association of British Insurers urged customers to look if there was any additional cover they could get as fears grow over an infestation. Cover is likely to vary between home insurance policies, with many not covering the cost of damage caused by vermin and pests,' a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'The costs of disinfestation might be covered under some add-ons to cover, like emergency home assistance. So, the advice on this is to check the cover provided under your policy.' Aviva said its standard home insurance policies exclude 'moths, vermin, insects, fungus, damp, rust, wet or dry rot'. Admiral said it also excluded damage and that its Home Emergency add-on would not cover bedbugs. Axa also said it would not cover bedbugs.

He said that he had contacted officials in Paris after the French capital became overwhelmed by an outbreak with the insects reported in schools, trains, hospitals and cinemas. Many fear that bed bugs have made their way over to the UK, as people have spotted them in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Now, Richard Grimes, Managing Director and Pest Control Expert at Acorn Environment Services, has revealed how you can banish the insects from your home. Has your house been infested by bed bugs? Please email: tipsdailymail.com Richard Grimes, Managing Director and Pest Control Expert at Acorn Environment Services, has revealed how you can banish the insects from your home He said: 'Bed bugs are not picky and they can very easily hitch a ride on our luggage or clothes, making it incredibly easy for this infestation to find its way to the UK. 'That is why it is so important for Brits to have the information they need to protect themselves and their homes.' READ MORE: UK Bedbugs crisis: Put your duvets in the freezer, landlords tell tenants as national panic descends with London Underground passengers refusing to sit on train seats and council swamped with 'alarming number of calls' Advertisement While bed bugs may seem small and harmless, they can soon take over your whole house. For some, their bites are uncomfortable, showing up on skin as itchy red bumps as they feast on human and animal blood. Mr Grimes said that bed bugs have 'a reddish-brown, flat, oval bodies and leave itchy bites that are either in a line or clusters.' He recommends that Brits remove the clutter from their homes and avoid storing items on the floor. The pest expert said that those struggling with an infestation should wash bedding and clothing at a high temperature. 'Bed bugs and their eggs cannot survive at temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius, so high temperature washes and tumble drying for at least 30 minutes can help to kill them off,' said Mr Grimes. Rik Smith, director of tenancy services at Goodlord, has also issued a series of tips to tenants worried about their bugs - ranging from the extreme to the bizarre. If you are concerned that you may have brought the bugs into the house, Mr Smith says you should 'put affected clothes and bedding in the freezer for a few hours before washing'. You should also take steps to 'wash bedding and clothes on a hot wash (at least 60C) and tumble dry on a hot setting for 30 minutes'. When that is done, it is important to hoover the house thoroughly and empty the bag - as the bugs may still be alive in there.

QA What is the problem? Bedbugs are no strangers to the UK but there have been concerns about sightings in London, Luton and Manchester, suggesting the problem is widespread and growing. Pest control firm Rentokil says infestations have soared 65 per cent over the past year. Why is Luton affected? The Bedfordshire town, as with London and Manchester, is a major international transport hub. Planes fly to French cities including Paris, the epicentre of an outbreak, Lyon and Nice. Luton is also within the London commuter belt. How is France hit? Scenes of discarded mattresses around Paris indicate the scale of the issue. There are also reports of infestations in seats and soft furnishings in public buildings and mass transport systems. MP Mathilde Panot recently took a test tube filled with dead bedbugs into the Paris parliament to highlight the problem in 'hospitals, schools, workplaces, retirement homes, prisons, trains and cinema theatres'. What can we do? Bedbugs are difficult to have removed. They are so small they can get inside mattresses plus folds in fabrics and clothing. Treating an infestation in a house can cost 600 to 800 for an average three-bed house - though multiple treatments are often needed. The process is also disruptive as beds need to be stripped and wardrobes, drawers and shelves emptied with contents sealed. Occupants also must leave the property. How do I treat bites? These can be uncomfortable and itchy and may lead to swelling but usually not worse - with an extreme and life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, being a rare side-effect. They generally subside after about a week but measures can be taken to reduce discomfort, such as putting a cool, damp cloth on the affected area and avoiding scratching. Antihistamines or a mild steroid cream can also help.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Many fear that bed bugs have made their way over to the UK, as people have spotted them in London, Luton and Manchester.

This marks the third consecutive year that CIIE exhibition products have been transported to Shanghai via the China-Europe Freight Train. The Jinbo China-Europe freight train primarily transports exhibition products for the CIIE. The train this year carried mainly cosmetics and mechanical equipment from Fortune Global 500 companies participating in the 6th CIIE, with a total of 70 TEUs and a cargo value exceeding 16 million euros (16.87 million). Departing from Duisburg, Germany, on Sept.21 and passing through Poland, Belarus, Russia, and Kazakhstan, the train entered China through the Alashankou railway port, covering a distance of over 10,000 kilometers in a 20-day journey. Sun Chenghai, deputy director-general of CIIE, said during the reception ceremony that this year's CIIE has achieved record highs in terms of the exhibition area and the number of participating Fortune Global 500 companies and leading industry enterprises. Zhu Yi, vice president of Orient International, one of the companies involved in operating the China-Europe Freight Train, emphasized that the time the China-Europe Freight Train reached Shanghai from Europe is only one-third of sea freight and the transportation cost is significantly lower than air freight. As a flagship brand of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the China-Europe Freight Train offers various advantages, such as year-round availability, high transportation capacity, environmental friendliness, low-carbon footprint, and a guarantee of smooth and safe operations. To better serve the 6th CIIE, the railway authorities have planned to operate three Jinbo China-Europe freight train trains, expecting to transport 210 TEUs of cargo worth over 350 million yuan (48 million). Since its inaugural run in 2021, Jinbohas facilitated European countries and other countriesalong the BRI route to participate in the CIIE, with the starting stations spanning from Duisburg and Hamburg in Germany to Malaszewicze in Poland. A noteworthy development for this year's first Jinbo is the implementation of electronic bills of lading for railway transport, enhancing the digitization of CIIE services and promoting the high-quality development of logistics and financial services in Shanghai. According to the railway authorities, the China-Europe Freight Train (Shanghai) has operated 72 trains this year, transporting 7,272 TEUs, with a total cargo weight of approximately 68,000 tons and a cargo value of about 2.38 billionyuan. It connects more than 60 cities and stations in nine countries in Eurasia, playing a positive role in advancing the BRI and consolidating Shanghai's position as a gateway for the initiative.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The first Jinbo China-Europe freight train carrying exhibits for the 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) arrived at the Minhang Station in Shanghai on Wednesday.

Around 1,500 passengers were in the North East Express when it started its 33-hour-long journey from Delhi's Anand Vihar station for Khamakhya in Assam's Guwahati on Wednesday morning, he said. After the accident on Wednesday night, a total of 1,006 passengers boarded a relief train at Danapur to reach their destinations in Bihar, West Bengal and Assam, he added. Around 1,500 passengers boarded the train when it started in Delhi at 7.40 am yesterday. The number is a little high because those having partial tickets or were in the wait list also boarded, Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) Chief Public Relations Officer Sabyasachi De told PTI. Out of the total passengers, around 1,200 had tickets for de-boarding at 12 stations in the NFR's jurisdiction, from Katihar onwards, he said. There were 540 ticketed passengers for de-boarding at the five stations in Assam, including 389 at the final destination in Kamakhya, he said. At least four passengers died and several people were injured when 23 coaches of the train derailed near Raghunathpur station around 9.53 pm on Wednesday, according to the railways. As per our information, no passengers coming to Assam are in the list of casualties, De said. Asked about the onward journey of the travellers who were unhurt, he said The relief train started at 5 am and is scheduled to reach Kamakhya at 11 pm. A total of 1,006 passengers are coming and they will get down at different stations on the route. The CPRO said that the relief train will stop only at the scheduled stoppages of the beleaguered North East Express. Around 500 passengers will get down at the five stations in Assam, he said. The passengers will be provided meals and refreshments during the journey. The railways will also arrange for their travel by road from the Kamakhya station, the officer said. De also said that no train from Assam is cancelled as of now due to the accident. He said that the NFR has started helplines in different stations -- Guwahati (036127316212223), Kamakhya (03612674857), Katihar (9608815880), and New Jalpaiguri (8170034242).

This event, organized by the rail industry and the British Transport Police, aims to educate individuals on how to recognize and intervene in such situations, as well as report incidents. The latest survey conducted by UN Women UK reveals that sexual harassment is a prevalent issue, with 71 of women in the UK having experienced it in public spaces. The VR film being screened illustrates how small actions, such as offering to change seats or diverting the attention of the perpetrator, can prevent incidents from escalating. It is crucial for everyone to play a role in reducing harm by reporting any witnessed incidents. British Transport Police can be contacted by texting 61016 or by using the Railway Guardian app. In emergency situations, always call 999. This event is part of wider initiatives to combat sexual harassment within the public transport system. Northern, a train operator, has collaborated with students from the Bradford City Community Foundation to raise awareness about the issue. The film being screened at Birmingham New Street station was originally showcased at London Waterloo station. Jacqueline Starr, Chief Executive of the Rail Delivery Group, emphasizes the commitment of the industry to address all forms of sexual harassment and ensure the safety of passengers. She encourages individuals to report any uncomfortable situations. Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley and Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, expressed her support for the campaign, stating that everyone has the right to feel safe on railways and intervene to protect others. Jo MacPhail, HR Director and Deputy Managing Director at West Midlands Trains, stressed the importance of supporting this campaign, as sexual harassment is a real problem in our society, including on public transport. MacPhail believes that equipping individuals with knowledge on what to do in such situations can reduce harm and challenge these damaging behaviors. David Whitehouse, Safety and Security Director at Avanti West Coast, highlighted the commitment of the railway industry in ensuring the safety of passengers. He urges the public to be aware of different forms of sexual harassment and the role they can play in safely intervening and reporting incidents. This virtual reality experience serves as a valuable tool in raising awareness and equipping individuals with the necessary skills to create a safer environment on trains. By working together, passengers and railway authorities can help prevent and address incidents of sexual harassment.

Russia's Blac The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has been reporting that the major Russian offensive in the vicinity of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk Oblast, is flagging. Ukrainian military officials say they have continued to repel Russian attacks against their positions. Russian milbloggers (and again, these tend to be hard-war ultras, so to a certain extent their complaints count as statements against interest) attribute some of the Russian difficulties to inability to clear Ukrainian minefields, presumably under fire. One milblogger repeats complaints that worn out gun tubes are reducing the accuracy of Russian artillery fire. This is possible, and gun tubes (cannon barrels) do wear out with firing and need replacement. This, if true, is a logistical and management issue. This same source comments that over-optimistic assessments of unimportant local advances against unfortified sections of the zone may lead Russian forces to 'beat on concrete' fortifications until these forces run out. US and Ukrainian officials said that they would anticipated the Russian attacks, and were confident that Ukrainian forces would hold. John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, said, as paraphrased by the ISW, that Russian forces appear to be using human wave tactics, wherein the Russian military uses masses of poorly trained and equipped Russian soldiers to attempt to advance - the same practice Russian forces used during their failed winter offensive in winter 2023. Sunday's update from the ISW saw signs that President Putin is seeking to cool the more enthusiastic expectations of success around Avdiivka. He is described the operations around Avdiivka as an active defense, not an offensive, or even active combat operations. Sunday morning the UK's Ministry of Defense (MoD) described the importance of railroads to Russian logistics. Rail logistics continues to be a vital component in sustaining Russia's invasion. Russia uses its rail networks to move ammunition, armour, fuel and personnel into Ukraine. The rail network in occupied Ukraine remains largely viable but vulnerable to sporadic interdiction by Ukrainian artillery, air launched missiles and sabotage. In previous conflicts, attrition of rail transportation has required focused, sustained, and repeated attack by air andor ground forces. Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication in Ukraine and is constructing a new railway line to Mariupol which will reduce travel times for supplies to the Zaporizhzhia front. Russia is using civilian contractors and equipment to complete this project, likely calculating this will complicate targeting and preserve military railway troop capabilities for urgent tasks elsewhere. The new line falls within the notional range of Ukrainian long-range precision strike capabilities. Since suffering a series of strikes in August and September, the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) has highly likely doubled down on its defensive and reactive posture, the UK's MoD wrote Saturday. It has relocated many of its prestige assets - including cruise missile capable ships and submarines - from Sevastopol to operating and basing areas further east, such as Novorossiysk. Since July 2022, Ukraine has gained the initiative in the northwest Black Sea, forcing the powerful BSF to defend itself from uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs) and missile attacks as well as special operations. With notable and embarrassing exceptions, however, the BSF has mostly continued to train, maintain and defend itself whilst launching cruise missiles into Ukraine. It can almost certainly continue to do so from the eastern Black Sea. The Black Sea Fleet is now risk-averse. Despite the BSF's largely intact capabilities, there is only a realistic possibility of it using its conventional superiority in firepower to seize the initiative in the Western Black Sea. The risk of further military losses and the dire political consequences of Russian naval forces overtly attacking merchant shipping would highly likely outweigh any gain from attempting to enforce a blockade of Ukrainian-bound trade. The ISW reported that Ukrainian forces hit two Russian naval vessels, the Professor Nikolai Muru tugboat and the Pavel Derzhavin patrol ship, on October 13. As the Black Sea Fleet redeploys to Kerch, Novorossiysk, and Feodosia, lack of pier space and drydock facilities seem to have led them to retain a presence in Sevastopol. Redut seems to have replaced the Wagner Group as the leading private military company. The purported Private Military Company (PMC) Redut is recruiting mercenaries under the guise of volunteers, including former Wagner personnel, the UK's MoD reported this morning. The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) likely supervises and finances the group's activities, including its recruitment. Since the start of the invasion, Redut has been involved in combat operations in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Luhansk oblasts. The group highly likely has over 7,000 personnel. At present, Redut is one of a number of PMCs and Volunteer Corps units being utilised by the Russian Ministry of Defence to augment Russian regular forces. It is a realistic possibility that the Russian Ministry of Defence's practise of recruiting through 'volunteer' units has contributed to Russia avoiding further unpopular mobilisations. Trend Micro describes the recent activities of Void Rabisu, which it describes as an intrusion set associated with both financially motivated ransomware attacks and targeted campaigns on Ukraine and countries supporting Ukraine. In this case the intrusion was directed against the Women Political Leaders (WPL) Summit that convened in Brussels between June 7th and 8th of this year. The Summit's goal was to increase the participation of women in politics, and while that may not have been something the threat actors necessarily approved of, it seems likelier that the conference was simply a target of opportunity, a occasion to prospect and compromise devices and systems belonging to political leaders. The ultimate payload Void Rabisu delivered was a new version of ROMCOM backdoor that we have dubbed as ROMCOM 4.0 (also known as PEAPOD). Void Rabisu is an interesting mixed case of a organization (or, if you will an intrusion set) that has been financially motivated, that trades in the criminal-to-criminal market, but which engages in espionage and, once it is on its target, acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT). Void Rabisu also acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor when it targets governments and military. In June 2023, Void Rabisu exploited the vulnerability CVE-2023-36884 -- still a zero-day vulnerability then -- in campaigns using the Ukrainian World Congress and the July 2023 NATO summit as lures. The extraordinary geopolitical circumstances surrounding the war in Ukraine drives some of the financial-seeking threat actors (including Void Rabisu) toward campaigns motivated by espionage. Some of its earlier, more clearly financially motivated actions have been thought to be associated with a Cuba ransomware affiliate, BleepingComputer notes, but the activity now seems focused on zero-day exploitation for the purposes of espionage. There is no attribution of the activity so far. While we have no evidence that Void Rabisu is nation-state-sponsored, Trend Micro writes, it is possible that it is one of the financially motivated threat actors from the criminal underground that got pulled into cyberespionage activities due to the extraordinary geopolitical circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine. And in general Void Rabisu has consistently acted against Ukrainian interests.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has been reporting that the major Russian offensive in the vicinity of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk Oblast, is flagging.

Media reports emerged in early October that North Korea had begun its weapons deliveries to Russia, with satellite images confirming increased rail traffic at the North Korean-Russian border. Earlier in August, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea's capital to convince the country's leadership to provide artillery ammunition that Russian forces could use in its war against Ukraine. In the spring of 2023, Moscow reportedly approached Pyongyang with the offer of food supplies in exchange for weapons. North Korea has been heavily militarized since the end of the war with its Southern Korean neighbors in 1953 but suffers from chronic food shortages.

CTA leaders worry that riders feel a sense of complacency around climbing onto the tracks, chief safety and security officer Nancy-Ellen Zusman said. Zusman and the CTA hope to bring rail trespassing, and the harms that can result, onto a downward trajectory with a new rail safety campaign launched Monday. It is more common for people to climb down onto the tracks to retrieve objects than because they are intoxicated or suicidal, Zusman said. In fact, suicide is the least common reason, followed by intoxication. But it is most common for riders to climb down for no known reason at all. Fifty-three percent of people who have climbed onto CTA tracks this year as of August had no known reason for doing so, according to CTA personnel. CTA trains are powered by an electrified third rail, which carries 600 volts of electricity -- a potentially lethal amount. Unfortunately, we do see cases in which people are just goofing around, CTA spokesperson Brian Steele said. ... They are not retrieving an item, they have not fallen, they just make the decision to go down there. The CTA's first rail safety campaign launched 10 years ago last month. Trespassing incidents on CTA tracks dropped 17 the following year, Steele said. Was the campaign solely responsible for that? Hard to say, Steele said. However, there is no question that the campaign really raised awareness and began a lot of dialogue. Though the CTA has not tracked trespassing consistently since the first rail safety campaign in 2013, Steele said, reduced rail service during 2020 led to a recent annual low of 1,584 trespassing. In 2021, about 1,900 people stepped onto the CTA tracks and 1,860 in 2022. Steele says the CTA expects another slight drop in trespassing incidents by the end of this year. Service interruptions due to trespassing on the electrified CTA tracks, also known as rail right of way, are most common on the Red and Blue lines, Steele said. So far this year, 350 trespassers climbed down onto Red Line tracks, with 323 trespassers on Blue Line tracks. The Yellow Line, traveling between Rogers Park and Skokie, sees the fewest rail right-of-way delays, with 30 trespassers so far this year. Service interruptions due to rail trespassing have caused 93 hours of delays through August of this year, Steele said. The CTA does not track what proportion of delays overall are caused by trespassing, though rail right-of-way delays are most common during weekday rush hours, Steele said. It is basically just a function of the ridership -- when more people are there, there are more instances, Steele said. When someone climbs onto the rail right of way, CTA personnel cut power to large sections of track so that tracks are not active or electric during rescue attempts, Zusman said. There is a whole ripple effect, Zusman said. While the CTA does not track the demographics of people who come down onto the tracks, Steele said the organization hopes to reach more young people with the new campaign. Some ads parody music streaming service Spotify with fake song titles like Severe Burns, Sudden Impact and Everybody Hurts. CTA platforms rise 4 feet above track level, a distance some riders find deceivingly short, Steele said. The amount of electricity running through the tracks can be fatal, but conductivity -- factoring in conditions like clothes and the weather -- determines climbers' fate. Track shutdowns happen fast when people are spotted on the third rail, Steele said, and CTA workers are trained to climb safely onto the tracks to get riders' things if alerted. Sometimes people go down to the tracks thinking, 'I will just get my phone,' and then realize, 'I should not be here, it is difficult for me to get back up,' Steele said. Riders have been known to climb down onto CTA tracks and try to walk the rail from one station to another, Steele said. Graffiti artists are also frequent trespassers on CTA rails, accounting for 24 of recorded incidents through August 2023. Train yards at the end of the Red Line at Howard, and on the Green Line at Ashland and Midway, are graffiti hot spots, though graffiti-based climbers are most active on Orange Line tracks, Steele said. Metra struggles with similar graffiti issues, Zusman said -- though tracks at Metra train yards are not electrified. A lot of people will go into where we store our trains, typically in the nighttime, to try and graffiti a train, Steele said. When they are there, they are around live tracks. The campaign, which also features a looping audio message and a series of PSAs in the style of graphic novels, can be seen on every platform and in train cars, focusing on high-traffic stations such as Belmont, Steele said. When tracking why people trespass on CTA tracks, CTA staff rely on data collected at the scene, Zusman said. Staff are not required to follow up on police or medical examiner's reports when someone appears intoxicated, for instance. Basically we look for the signs of impairment -- any type of impairment -- and that is what is reported in our system, Zusman said. The CTA also tracks when trains collide with people or brush people while pulling into a station. Though not every contact between a train and a rider ends in injury, the CTA investigates every time it is reported by a rider or train operator or shown on security cameras, Zusman said. Though it is rare for a rail right-of-way incident to end in death, it is doubly tragic knowing that the circumstances could have been avoided, Steele said. The number of fatalities every year is extremely low compared to our ridership, Steele said. That said, one fatality is one too many.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Just under 1,200 people climbed onto CTA tracks in the first eight months of 2023.

The pit in the road is designed to stop people from driving into the busway. It is wide enough for small vehicles to fall into but small enough that larger ones, such as buses, can pass over it. Warning signs are in place, yet some locals are complaining that up to five drivers are still getting stuck each week.

He is in his 80s, but she insists he is a competent driver who misunderstood the exit signs leading out of a car park. She said: He somehow ended up back in the same car park again. He said the signage was poor and if he exited the same way, he would end up doing the same thing. So he went a different way and ended up in the car trap. We know of someone in their 20s who has also gone into the trap - you cannot argue this is because of my father's age. Considering the number of incidents, there must be another way to manage the junction that does not because this much damage to vehicles. Philippa Parker from Wiltshire, who drove into the trap last summer, also argues poor signposting leading up to the trap is what led to the incident. She said: The signs were totally inadequate. Motorists were driving up to the junction while we were waiting for the recovery. If we were not there, they would have made the same mistake. The abuse and awful language people were shouting as they passed us was also shocking. It left us with a very bad impression of St Ives afterwards. Cambridgeshire County Council said last month it is only aware of 60 incidents of vehicles caught in the trap since it opened 12 years ago. It also described the warnings currently in place, such as signage, as adequate. Cllr Kevin Reynolds from Cambridgeshire County Council has admitted he has little sympathy for the drivers who get stuck, stating: If people driving along that road cannot see a big hole in the ground in front of them then I would argue they would not be able to see a small child.

Moscow's forces lost eight tanks, 25 APVs and 33 artillery systems in the past day, Ukraine's General Staff said on Sunday. The Independent cannot independently confirm Kyiv's numbers which come after Putin claimed Ukraine's counteroffensive completely failed. As for the counteroffensive, which is allegedly stalling, it has failed completely, Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. Russia currently controls about 17.5 of Ukrainian territory and a four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive this year has resulted in almost no net territorial gains. Key Points Putin says Ukraine's counteroffensive failed completely Sunday 15 October 2023 09:39 , Sam Rkaina Vladimir Putin has branded Ukraine's counteroffensive a failure. While Kyiv took back territory taken by Russia last year, the Ukrainian army has struggled to penetrate Russian lines which have been bolstered with minefields and thousands of extra troops. As for the counteroffensive, which is allegedly stalling, it has failed completely, Mr Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. The opposing side is preparing new active offensive operations. We see it and we know it, he added when asked about the battle for the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. According to the Belfer Center at Harvard, Ukraine made a net gain of 8 square miles of territory the month to 10 October. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces. Russia bombards Sumy Oblast but no Ukraine casualties 04:27 , Barney Davis Ninety-three explosions were reported in Sumy Oblast on Sunday according to Governor Volodymyr Artiukh. Artiukh noted that, as a result of Russian shelling in the region, civilian infrastructure and homes were damaged. No casualties were reported. Enemy military aircraft, kamikaze drones, artillery systems, and salvo fire systems were used, he said. Over the past month of (Russian) shelling, seven civilians have died in our region, including a 13-year-old girl. Many wounded. Artiukh added that there are currently over 5,000 homes in Sumy Oblast that have been damaged by Russian shelling. Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia, has been targeted by Russian forces on a near-daily basis since April 2022. Russian shelling killed a 58-year-old woman and wounded a 26-year-old man in Donetsk Oblast, the media outlet Suspilne reported. The woman was killed in her garden when shells struck her home in the city of Avdiivka. A man was taken to the hospital with a concussion, fracture and shrapnel wounds for medical treatment. According to preliminary data, the Russian army shelled both settlements with artillery, regional spokesperson Anastasia Medvedeva said. Russian attacks on Ukraine over a 24-hour period killed six people, local officials reported Sunday. 02:24 , Barney Davis Two people were killed and three more injured in the Kherson area after more than 100 shells bombarded the region over the weekend, local governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on social media. Two guided bombs later hit key infrastructure in Kherson city, sparking a partial blackout and disruption to the area's water supply, reported the head of the city's military administration, Roman Mrochko. Local officials said two more people died in the Donetsk area and that a 57-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were killed by an airstrike that destroyed their home in the Kharkiv region. In a separate incident, a 14-year-old boy was killed by a mine in a field in Ukraine's Mykolaiv region, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said. The explosion also injured another 12-year-old boy. Fighting remained fierce across eastern Ukraine over the weekend, with Russian forces repeatedly attempting to encircle the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, military officials said. Russian governer underfire for saying army unprepared for Ukraine war Monday 16 October 2023 00:30 , Barney Davis A Russian governor was accused by critics on Sunday of discrediting Russia's armed forces after telling residents in her region that the country had no need for its war in Ukraine. Natalya Komarova, the governor of the Khanty-Mansiysk region and a member of President Vladimir Putin's governing United Russia party, made the remarks during a meeting with residents in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk on Saturday. Critics have called for authorities to launch an investigation into her remarks, but Komarova has not been detained or faced any charges so far. A video of the event posted on social media showed the politician being confronted by the wife of a Russian soldier who said that mobilized men had been poorly equipped for the front line. Are you asking me (why your husband does not have equipment), knowing that I am the governor and not the minister of defence?, the 67-year-old said. As a whole, we did not prepare for this war. We do not need it. We were building a completely different world, so in this regard, there will certainly be some inconsistencies and unresolved issues, she said. President Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing this week in a rare visit from the Russian leader. During Tuesday's trip to Beijing, Putin will attend a forum marking 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's global infrastructure program that has helped boost its influence worldwide. China and Russia declared a no limits partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two. Washington and Brussels have been eyeing with alarm the relationship between China and Russia, with Beijing refusing to condemn Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as it has voiced support for the principle of territorial integrity. Over the past decade, Xi has built with Putin's Russia the most consequential undeclared alliance in the world, Graham Allison, professor at Harvard University and a former assistant secretary of defence under Bill Clinton, told Reuters. The YOU.S. will have to come to grips with the inconvenient fact that a rapidly rising systemic rival and a revanchist one-dimensional superpower with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world are tightly aligned in opposing the USA. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that the Biden administration hopes to push a new weapons package for Israel and Ukraine through Congress that will be significantly higher than 2 billion. Sullivan, in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation, said YOU.S. President Joe Biden will have intensive talks with the YOU.S. Congress this week on the need for the package to be approved. Asked whether the request would be for 2 billion, as has been previously reported, Sullivan said: The number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat. Some Republicans have already said they would not back any Israel aid package that also contains aid for Ukraine. Ukraine working to evacuate 260 citizens from Gaza and Israel Sunday 15 October 2023 21:26 , Barney Davis Ukraine is working to evacuate nearly 260 of its citizens from Gaza and to fly other Ukrainians out of Israel, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Sunday. Ukraine's embassy in Israel said on social media on Saturday that 207 Ukrainian citizens, including 63 children, were evacuated from Tel Aviv to Romania on Saturday and that another flight would take 155 people to Romania on Sunday. Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said three parties would have to approve the departure of Ukrainians from Gaza, complicating the process. The Palestinians need to release all Ukrainian citizens, Egypt to accept them, and Israel should not conduct any operation at this time, so that the crossing point would be safe, he said in remarks televised on Sunday. Russian governor reported to police for there is 'no need' for the war in Ukraine Sunday 15 October 2023 21:15 , Alexander Butler A Russian governor was accused by critics of discrediting Russia's armed forces after telling residents in her region that the country had no need for its war in Ukraine.Natalya Komarova, the governor of the Khanty-Mansiysk region and a member of President Vladimir Putin's governing United Russia party, made the remarks during a meeting with residents in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk on Saturday.Critics have called for authorities to launch an investigation into her remarks, but Komarova has not been detained or faced any charges so far. Russian forces 'bolster' positions across Ukraine Sunday 15 October 2023 20:15 , Alexander Butler Russian forces have bolstered their positions across the Ukrainian frontline, Vladimir Putin claimed. He said troops had been improving their position in a vast area in an interview on Russian television, which was posted on social media. On Saturday, Kyiv reported heated fighting around Avdiivka Saturday, saying Russian forces had not stopped assaulting it for days in their attempt to surround it. What is happening now along the entire length of the line of contact is called 'an active defence'. And our troops are improving their position at almost entire area. Quite a large area, Putin said. Putin: US seeking war with Russia and China is 'nonsense' Sunday 15 October 2023 19:15 , Alexander Butler Russian president Vladimir Putin said suggestions the US is preparing for a simultaneous war against Russia and China were nonsense. I do not think these are healthy thoughts in the minds of healthy people, because to say that the United States is preparing for war with Russia, well we are all preparing for war because we follow the ancient principle: if you want peace, get ready for war, he said. But we want peace, Putin said with a chuckle. Moreover, to fight with both Russia and China, it is nonsense - I do not think it is serious. I think they are just scaring each other. British artillery guns are not used due to shortage of ammunition Ukrainian soldiers can only use L119 howitzers less than one a day because of the catastrophic shortage of ammunition used for them. The British L119 is a nice gun, very comfortable to work with and accurate to fire. But we do not have enough shells for it - last week, we fired only five shells all week. It is catastrophically limited. When we are in battle, we are having to weigh up very carefully whether we should use a she will or not, an artillery commander told The Telegraph.

US says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to Russia The White House said North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites.

US says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to Russia Sunday 15 October 2023 14:10 , Sam Rkaina President Zelensky's international aid comes after the White House said North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. On Friday White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's nuclear program. Ukraine boosted by military aid from multiple countries this week, Zelensky says Sunday 15 October 2023 13:24 , Sam Rkaina Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has been boosted with military aid from a number of countries this week. In a video statement on Twitter, he said: This week has strengthened Ukraine. I am grateful to all of our partners who have provided new military aid packages. Air defence, artillery, drones, armored vehicles, and other items. The world understands what Russia is planning and what terrorist attacks it is capable of carrying out. We also know how to respond to the occupier's actions. And we will respond forcefully. In an era when terror is spreading over the world, it is vital that the world sends a message that is crystal clear: protection from terror will not falter anywhere. Madonna shows support for Ukraine as she returns to the stage in London Sunday 15 October 2023 12:15 , Sam Rkaina Madonna has shown support for Ukraine on the opening night of her Celebration Tour in London on Saturday night. The singer draped a Ukraine flag over her back before launching into Do not Cry for Me Argentina. Weeks after a health scare, the 65 year-old performed at the O2, treating thousands of adoring fans to more than 40 songs from her four-decade career, a host of extravagant outfits and a variety of theatrical stage set-ups. Russia building new railway line to speed up supplies Sunday 15 October 2023 11:24 , Sam Rkaina Russia is building a new railway line to Mariupol to reduce travel times to the Zaporizhzhia front, the Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily update on the war in Ukraine, the MoD said: Rail logistics continue to be a vital component in sustaining Russia's invasion. Russia uses its rail networks to move ammunition, armour, fuel and personnel into Ukraine. Russian forces are conducting an 'active defence' and have been able to improve their positions at almost entire line of contact in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday. What is happening now along the entire length of the line of contact is called 'an active defence', Putin said in video remarks posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin. And our troops are improving their position at almost entire area. Quite a large area. Two civilians killed in Russian assaults on Avdiivka Sunday 15 October 2023 08:00 , Lydia Patrick Two civilians were killed in Russian attacks on the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka on Saturday, according to the Donetsk region administration. In one of its few offensives in months, Russia's military pressed on for a fifth day with assaults on Avdiivka, with shelling so fierce that emergency crews were unable to recover the dead from wrecked buildings. The administration of the Donetsk region said on Sunday on the Telegram messaging app that one more person was injured elsewhere in the region. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Sunday its forces had repelled 15 Russian attacks near Avdiivka, Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region, while Russian forces launched heavy air strikes in the area. Oleh Sinehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region also in Ukraine's east, said on Sunday a 54-year-old woman and a 57-year-old man were killed and one woman injured in an overnight Russian air attack. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet Xi Jinping in China this week, marking only his second visit outside former USSR since the start of the war in Ukraine. The Russian president will be attending the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on 17, 18 October. This would also be Mr Putin's first trip outside of former USSR since Hague-based International Criminal Court issued a warrant for him in March over the deportation of children from Ukraine. Russia's Black Sea Fleet conducts drills in Crimea Sunday 15 October 2023 06:45 , Vishwam Sankaran Russia's Black Sea Fleet is conducting drills using rocket launchers off the Crimean-port Sevastopol. Everything is calm in the city, the Crimean-port's Russian-installed governor said today in a post on the Telegram messaging app. It is known that Russia's Black Sea Fleet launches many of its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine from the Black Sea. Russia's Black Sea Fleet has doubled down on defence measures after suffering setbacks in the recent months, according to the UK Defense Ministry. Since suffering a series of strikes in August and September, the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) has highly likely doubled down on its defensive and reactive posture, the Defense Ministry said yesterday. Ukraine has gained the initiative in the northwest Black Sea since June launching unmanned surface vessels, unmanned air vehicles, and missile attacks against Russia's Black Sea Fleet. The Russian fleet has mostly continued to defend itself while also launching missiles into Ukraine, which it can almost certainly continue to do so from the eastern (region of the) Black Sea, the UK Defense Ministry said. More than two dozen drones launched from Ukraine have reportedly been destroyed over Kursk and other Russian regions. About 18 of these were downed over Kursk in southern Russia and two where destroyed over Belgorod, another region bordering Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said early today. Kursk governor Roman Starovoit said there were no casualties in the drone attack, Reuters reported. Third of Ukrainian territory unsafe due to mines, Zelensky says Sunday 15 October 2023 04:14 , Vishwam Sankaran Nearly a third of Ukrainian territory is unsafe due to mines and unexploded ordinance, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday. Demining and clearing of explosive materials were issues discussed at a two-day conference in Croatia in October. About 250 people have reportedly been killed by mines so far in Ukraine, and over 500 have been injured. More than 40 countries took part in the conference in Croatia, and jointly pledged about 500 million euros (530 million) to assist in demining Russia's Black Sea Fleet has moved a number of its 'prestige assets' following a series of strikes by Ukraine in August and September, the Ministry of Defence has said. In it is daily update on progress on the war, the MoD said cruise missile capable ships and submarines had been relocated from Sevastopol to bases further east. The risk of further military losses and the dire political consequences of Russian naval forces overtly attacking merchant shipping would highly likely outweigh any gain from attempting to enforce a blockade of Ukrainian-bound trade. Ukrainian officials have said assaults being carried out by Russian forces are relentless, as the ongoing attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka entered its fifth day. The enemy has not stopped either assaulting or shelling positions around Avdiivka, city head Vitalii Barabash said on Ukrainian television. Barabash also reported that Moscow was deploying additional forces to encircle the strategically important city in the eastern Donetsk region, situated just north of the Moscow-held regional capital, also called Donetsk. Around 1,600 civilians remain within the city, a stark contrast to its prewar population of about 31,000. Barabash's comments came after Russia's YOU.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told a YOU.N. Security Council meeting on Friday that the intensified attacks in the east amounted to a new stage in Moscow's campaign in Ukraine. Russian troops have, for several days now, switched over to active combat action practically throughout the entire front line -- The so-called Ukrainian counteroffensive can therefore be considered finished, he said. Ukraine has said they have uncovered more than 700,000 explosive objects in the country. Sappers surveyed more than 152,000 hectares looking for potentially deadly devices. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine posted a video of their efforts on X on Saturday morning. An 11 year-old boy has reportedly been killed in a Russian attack on a Ukraine village. The child died during a rocket strike against the village of Bahatyr, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's National Police said on Saturday. His brother, six, and their mother, 31, were also injured in the blast, the Kyiv Independent reported. Fighting in east significantly worsened, Kyiv warns Saturday 14 October 2023 10:44 , Sam Rkaina Fighting along the northern portion of Ukraine's eastern front has significantly worsened in recent days, the commander of Kyiv's ground forces said on Saturday. Oleksandr Syrskyi, who was visiting Ukrainian troops in the area, said Russian forces had regrouped after suffering losses and were attacking around the village of Makiivka and towards the city of Kupiansk. The main objective of the enemy is the defeat of a grouping of our troops, the encirclement of Kupiansk and to reach the Oskil River, he said in comments carried by an official military platform. Syrskyi added that Russian forces were carrying out dozens of assaults each day, but that Ukrainian troops had been ready and were holding their ground. The development comes as Kremlin forces were also pummelling the strategic Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, on a different section of the eastern front, in what Russian and Western officials said amounted to a new offensive. A four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive has made some progress in both the east, near Bakhmut, and in the south, where Kyiv hopes to reach the Sea of Azov, but gains have been incremental. Updated map shows latest situation on the ground Saturday 14 October 2023 10:16 , Sam Rkaina The Ministry of Defence has posted a new map showing the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine. The UK's MoD shared the image on Friday, highlighting two likely Ukrainian advances in Bakhmut in the east and Orikhiv in the south. US 'confident Ukraine will beat back new Russian offensive' Saturday 14 October 2023 09:00 , Sam Rkaina In Washington, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Russian action amounted to a new offensive, showing that Russia was in no way ready to give up its campaign. But the United States, he said, was confident that the Ukrainian military would beat back Russian forces. Military analyst Serhiy Zgurets, writing on the Espreso TV website, said Avdiivka had withstood Russian attacks in 2014, when Russian-financed separatists had seized large chunks of Ukrainian territory. The area had since been fortified. All Russian attacks have resulted in significant losses for them, he wrote. Russia's representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzia, said the intensified battles in the east signified a new stage in its campaign. Russian troops have, for several days now, switched over to active combat action practically throughout the entire front line, Nebenzia told a session of the YOU.N. Security Council. The so-called Ukrainian counteroffensive can therefore be considered finished. Russian forces pound Avdiivka for fourth day in row Saturday 14 October 2023 08:01 , Sam Rkaina Russian forces pounded the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka for the fourth day in a row on Friday, a new offensive in Putin's 19-month-old invasion. In attacks elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian missile strike killed one person in the city of Pokrovsk, also in the east, while a drone attack in the south killed a women and seriously injured her husband. In Avdiivka, known for its large coking plant in Ukraine's Donbas industrial heartland, officials said the Russian assaults had left the already-gutted city in flames. The fighting has been going on for four consecutive days, Vitaliy Barabash, head of the city's military administration, told Ukrainian national television. They have substantial reserves of personnel and equipment. Avdiivka is completely ablaze. They shoot, using everything they have. The hospital is again under fire, as are administrative buildings and our volunteer centre. White House warns Israel crisis is stretching its ability to support Ukraine: 'Running out of runway' Saturday 14 October 2023 06:00 , Joe Middleton The White House said it was running out of runway on supporting both Ukraine and Israel as US Republican lawmakers warned they would protest any funding request for military aid from the Biden administration for the two crisis-hit nations. I think in the immediate term, right now, we can continue to support - with the authorities in the appropriations we have - Israel and Ukraine. But, you know, we are ... certainly running out of runway, said John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. White House warns Israel crisis is stretching its ability to support Ukraine Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka: 'The enemy does not stop' Saturday 14 October 2023 05:00 , Joe Middleton The Ukrainian military continues to hold its ground in the face of Russia's relentless assault on the eastern city of Avdiivka, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as the battle intensified for a third day. Russia has moved a large armoured column of three battalions, including some 2,000 troops, dozens of armoured vehicles and jets into the northern flank of the Avdiivka front for what has been described as the biggest military offensive in months. The Ukrainian forces said they had repelled more than 20 attacks by the Russian army in Avdiivka and the surrounding regions in the past 24 hours, in what was described as a blow to Moscow's attempts to use the offensive to show that the tide of the war was turning in its favour. Ukraine holds out as Russia steps up relentless assault on Avdiivka North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia, says White House Saturday 14 October 2023 04:00 , Joe Middleton The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's nuclear programme. The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by train to southwestern Russia. The containers were shipped between September 7 and October 1 between Najin, North Korea, and Dunay, Russia, according to the White House. Putin makes first trip abroad since international arrest warrant issued over Ukraine invasion Mr Putin arrived in the central Asian nation on Thursday for a two-day state visit for bilateral meetings and a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the founding of Russia's Kant military airbase outside Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. The Kremlin chief has rarely taken trips abroad since he launched what he called a special military operation in Ukraine in early 2022 and is not known to have stepped out of Russia since the ICC warrant was issued.

The land grab in sports administration saw Russia's Olympic officials announce last week that they were accepting the local sports councils of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia as new members. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Russia's suspension saying the move by the Russian Olympic Committee was a breach of the Olympic Charter, a set of rules and principles for international sports bodies. The suspension will not have any immediate effect on Russians who are in line to compete at international events as neutral athletes, such as in qualifying stages for next year's Paris Olympics. IOC bans Russian Olympic Committee for including annexed territories Russia hit 6 ships, 150 port facilities, destroyed 300,000 T of grain -Kyiv government Saturday 14 October 2023 00:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed over 300,000 tonnes of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels had been already loaded with grain for exports and used a new humanitarian grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. Russia destroyed 300,000 tons of grain since July in port, ship attacks Friday 13 October 2023 23:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Russia has destroyed almost 300,000 metric tons of grain since July in attacks on Ukraine's port facilities and on ships, the Ukrainian government said on Friday, underscoring the war's threat to global food security. In summer, Moscow quit a YOU.N.-brokered deal that had allowed exports of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea safely. Since then, Russian forces have hit six civilian ships and 150 port and grain facilities during 17 attacks, destroying crops headed for export, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said in a statement. This is Russia's attempt to deepen the food crisis in the countries which depend on Ukrainian products, Kubrakov said. The damage on Ukrainian ports reduced the country's grain export potential by 40, he said. Russia has attacked port facilities on both the Black Sea and Danube River. Ukraine is one of the world's largest wheat and corn exporters. The Russian Defence Ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. Kubrakov said 21 grain-loaded vessels have already used a new humanitarian grain corridor in the Black Sea that Kyiv established in August. He said that under the previous YOU.N. Black Sea Grain Initiative, Ukraine had exported 33 million tonnes of grain, with 60 of that shipped to African and Asian countries. US says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to Russia for Ukraine war Friday 13 October 2023 21:38 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain The White House said on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine.Speculation about a possible North Korean plan to refill Russia's munition stores drained in its protracted war with Ukraine flared last month, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and visit key military sites.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believes Kim is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program.The White House released images that it said show the containers were loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved via train to southwestern Russia.

Britain to boost military presence in Northern Europe Friday 13 October 2023 17:35 , Joe Middleton Britain said it planned to step up its military presence in Northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) defence cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Britain said in a statement it would send 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines and air men and women plus eight Royal Navy ships and a group of fast jets and military helicopters to help police and deter threats from Russia. Britain said they would take part in large-scale, multi-country exercises, and carry out air policing and cold weather training. JEF, a defence cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to outside activity, stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent, Sunak said in a statement. Zelenskiy and Dutch PM visit Odesa and agree to boost air defence Friday 13 October 2023 16:22 , Tara Cobham Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, visiting the Black Sea port of Odesa, vowed on Friday to improve Ukraine's air defences and to increase the security of a humanitarian corridor for grain exports. Zelenskiy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are vital to ensuring budget revenues following a surge in defence spending following Russia's invasion last year. Today we had a busy day in your beautiful city of Odesa, which was dedicated to global and security issues, Zelenskiy told a joint press conference with Rutte. We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole... The Odesa region has came under frequent Russian missile and drone attacks, and Zelenskiy and Rutte visited a damaged port. Zelenskiy described the air strikes as vile tactics and thanked Rutte for a new air defence package, which would include missiles for Patriot air defence systems and patrol ships. The Netherlands has provided Ukraine with financial aid and weapons during the war, and has led efforts to help train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. The fate of anyone who returns to Russia from abroad depends on how they have behaved, President Vladimir Putin said when asked about the future of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Fridman was reported to have returned to Russia this week for the first time since the start of the Ukraine conflict. Russian senator Dmitry Rogozin has asked investigators to check reports of possible funding of the Ukrainian armed forces by Fridman. If someone has behaved immorally and returns, they will feel it, Putin told reporters.

Russia continues to pummel Avdiivka in fourth day of fighting Friday 13 October 2023 11:19 , Tara Cobham Russian forces pummelled the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka from the ground and air on Friday, the fourth day of intense fighting in the biggest offensive by Russian forces in months. Ukraine said its forces were holding their ground but Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka's military administration, said the town was under constant attack from air, artillery and large numbers of troops. The battles have been going on for four days now. Fierce and really non-stop ... They are firing from everything they have available, Barabash said in televised comments. It was a very hot night in Avdiivka. There were several air strikes on the city itself ... the attacks do not stop day or night. The attack on Avdiivka is one of the few big assaults Russia has mounted since Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in early June to try to drive out Russian troops occupying large swathes of territory in the east and south. Russia will never be seen as reliable energy supplier, US energy official says Friday 13 October 2023 10:45 , Tara Cobham US Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources Geoffrey Pyatt said on Friday Russia would never again be viewed as a reliable energy supplier, a day after Washington imposed fresh sanctions on Moscow because of its war in Ukraine. Speaking at an online briefing ahead of next week's US-Japan Energy Security Dialogue, Pyatt also said the United States and its partners in the Group of 7 were committed to denying Russia any energy revenues. The United States on Thursday imposed the first sanctions on owners of tankers carrying Russian oil priced above the G7's price cap of 60 a barrel, in an effort to close loopholes in the mechanism. It is very clear to me that Russia is never again going to be viewed as a reliable energy supplier, Pyatt told reporters. In the case of our G7 partners in particular, we are also committed to work jointly to deny Russia future energy revenues, and target in particular investments and projects growing Russia's future energy revenue, he added.

The Independent cannot independently confirm Kyiv's numbers which come after Putin claimed Ukraine's counteroffensive completely failed. Russia currently controls about 17.5 of Ukrainian territory and a four-month-old Ukrainian counteroffensive this year has resulted in almost no net territorial gains. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution.","{'BART': {'other news': 0.307889848947525, 'personal or small scale isolated event and news': 0.27472564578056335, 'general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends': 0.15466144680976868, 'severe and extreme weather news ': 0.0758015513420105, 'warehouse and storage facilities disruption or destruction news': 0.06691772490739822, 'major maritime transportation disruption news': 0.04061231017112732, 'major air transportation disruption news': 0.033107053488492966, 'major railway transportation disruption news': 0.030058857053518295, 'major and large scale worker strike actions': 0.016225529834628105}}",other news,personal or small scale isolated event and news

For many older and disadvantaged Australians, the proposed constitutional changes were perceived to be threatening changes. Racial and social divisions did not commence with preparations for the Voice referendum. As a royal navy navigator and later buccaneer, William Dampier (1651-1715) made three voyages to WA and offered this interpretation of our indigenous people after his second voyage in 1697 with his infamous throw-away line: The inhabitants of this country are the miserabilist people in the world. Racial divisions were embedded in Captain Cook's landfalls in Eastern Australia in 1770 and even his earlier visits to Tahiti and New Zealand. Some indigenous people were killed by the crew in a reflexive action against the local population. The Endeavour struck a reef near Cooktown in North Queensland. The Endeavour was beached for repairs. Here the Guugu Yimithirr people lead by Coomen assisted crew members who were ill or disoriented. The crew were offered food and water. However, misunderstandings did occur in the Endeavour River encounter. At least one indigenous person was killed on 17 June 1770 by a member of the Endeavour's crew and perhaps others injured in the unequal skirmish. Despite the assistance offered at Cooktown to the crew of the Endeavour, Captain Cook had orders from the British Crown to take possession of lands deemed to be terra nullius or nobody's land. The momentum of the successive 1967 referendum continued in high court decisions from Mabo v Queensland in 1992 (No1 and 2), and Wik Peoples v Queensland in 1996. Favourable rulings continued in 2002 with Yorta Nation v Victoria (2002) over land and water rights in the Goulburn and Murray River Districts which were upheld by the High Court. Throughout the campaign, the mainstream media largely endorsed this claim of the social and racial divisiveness over acceptance of the Voice proposal. The outcomes of the No campaign are now history. The Guardian (15 October 2023) has detailed results of the Voice Referendum by states, territories and even electorates. There were several electorates with Yes Votes below 20 per cent including the electorates of Maranoa (15.9 per cent) and Flynn (16.4 per cent). In juxtaposition, over thirty seats supported the Yes case with results of strong support for the Yes Case in Melbourne (78.1 per cent) and Grayndler (74.5 per cent). The results of the Voice Referendum were close to the predictions of the best opinion polls as summarized by ABC News. In support of the commitment by Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles to moving forward after a day of infamy for indigenous reconciliation, our political future needs responsible risk-taking to address long-standing divisions particularly in regional and outer suburban areas across Australia. Lack of commitment to indigenous reconciliation is embedded in blind spots about other social, economic and cultural tensions. The Brisbane River forms a divide between the more affluent electorate of Ryan and some of the more challenged precincts in the federal electorate of Blair between Moggill and Riverview. This divide was covered in two of my previous articles for AIM Network in 2017 (here and here). Community leaders have been reluctant to foster better public transport links across the social divide between the more adjacent growth areas on the fringes of Brisbane in the Springfield District and the Ripley Valley and the Ipswich CBD. Similar public transport black-spots exist between Moggill and the northside fringes of Ipswich at Karana Downs (Brisbane), Mt. Crosby, Kholo and Karalee (Ipswich). Historically, Labor leaders from the Ipswich District were adept at responding to the needs of constituents. Even prior to 1900, a Labor member from the Rosewood Coalfields was elected to state parliament. It was more difficult to gain a federal representative because the federal electorate of Moreton extended into rural areas. When federal Labor member, James Wilkinson was defeated in 1906, it took 55 years for veteran Labor leader Bill Hayden to represent Ipswich from 1961. He defeated a popular local LNP minister in the Menzies Government during an unexpected short-term recession associated with the tightening of monetary policy. Despite the controversies like Labor's opposition to the war in Vietnam, Bill Hayden's staff excelled in responding to the concerns within his electorate on mainstream local issues. His vote increased at every election until 1969. There was a close result in 1975 in Oxley after the dismissal of Gough Whitlam but there were strong swings back to Labor as early as 1977. As in other Labor heartland electorates across Australia, support for the Labor Party was insufficient to halt the No campaign with its emphasis on fears of an advisory Voice Council to express the concerns of indigenous communities to federal governments of differing persuasions. There is a significant dichotomy in the results of the Voice referendum between Ryan in Brisbane and Blair. On a divisional basis, there was a No vote of 47.3 per cent in Ryan. In Blair the No vote was 69.8 per cent. The Yes vote achieved good results even in comfortable outer-suburban polling booths in Ryan despite the mortgage stresses facing new home-owners. The Yes vote was strong in in the electorate of Ryan although some mortgage stress was possibly still evident in the results from Brookfield (47.8 per cent) and Moggill (48.3 per cent). Across the federal electoral divide Blair, the Yes vote struggled to exceed 30 per cent at many polling booths. Weak support for the Yes case brought results extended was evident in Riverview (27.6 per cent), Karalee (30.6 per cent) and Tivoli (29.6 per cent) which can be located on the map provided. As expected, the Yes vote dipped in rural and semi-rural areas with a No vote of 85.4 per cent at Tarampa and 78.7 per cent at Walloon, 77.3 per cent in Rosewood township and 80.7 per cent at Grandchester. The Australian constitution is indeed difficult to change. Change is virtually impossible without bipartisan support. The Republic Referendum on 6 November 1999 was not carried in any of the states but succeeded in the ACT with a Yes vote of 63.3 per cent in juxtaposition with a No Vote of 62.6 per cent in Queensland at that time. Only eight of the forty-five referenda options since federation have been carried. Even formation of the Commonwealth of Australia itself prior to 1900 proved to be politically divisive. The federation referendum question had to be put to the all-male NSW electorate on two occasions. WA was a late starter in the constitutional stakes. This colony of the British Empire was omitted from the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 as carried by both houses of the British parliament. Cheers to the remote indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities in electorates like Kennedy and Leichhardt in Queensland who put their faith in the Yes case despite opposition from local LNP and conservative independent members. In the post-Voice era, neoconservative representatives will find it difficult to avoid acting on local concerns about the need for diversity of employment that is compatible with acute local concerns. There are core Labor values which are compatible with a contribution to Northern Development and indigenous reconciliation through water conservation schemes, community development initiatives, infrastructure investment and sustainable programmes to diversify rural and remote economies. Even at the best of times, tourism services into exotic historical, cultural and scenic spots in the Queensland outback during the cooler months were underdeveloped. Opportunities existed for greater indigenous involvement in tourism at places like Boodjamulla (Lawn Hill) National Park. Although the Waanyi people of this national park area received their native title claim in 2010, the proprietor of Adel's Grove relied largely on interstate grey nomads to operate its accommodation and restaurant facilities for guests the last time I visited this site. More than a century ago, Albert de Lestang (1854-1959) had a much deeper commitment to the local savanna ecosystem. He experimented with the introduction of exotic and native plants at Adel's Grove and operated a store for passing tourists. Fire destroyed Albert's dwellings in the 1950s. Fire also destroyed the hub of the accommodation at Adel's Grove out quite recently. The need for greater indigenous involvement in local tourism is essential. With the support of the Queensland government, the Waanyi people negotiated an agreement with the zinc mining operations in this locality which continued until operations ceased temporarily in 2015. A history of the progressive association between mining and the Waanyi people is available online. The monograph was developed by the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining at UQ. Reaching across the political aisle at state and federal levels can assist in overcoming the disappointments of the Voice Referendum results. There are places in North West Queensland which could enthuse tourists during the winter months. The outreach of current tourism access only taps the surface of the vast array of exotic places which dot North West Queensland. Similar resources exist in the Cairns Hinterland and on Cape York from the days when mining activity moved into these remote frontiers even prior to the turn of the last century. The (locally) famous mine tram tunnel at Hightville. This tunnel was built in 1914 for the tram line that carted copper ore from the Wee Macgregor mine down the ridge to the Ballara siding, for rail transport to Townsville via Cloncurry. The Wee Macgregor mine is on the other side of the tunnel from where this photograph was taken. I would not venture through the tunnel if you are afraid of bats, there is quite a colony roosting in there. May 2007. Many potential historic relics spots are on private grazing properties and operated in the federation era (1901-14) prior to the opening of Mt.

On Monday the opposition leader all but abandoned his much-criticised suggestion of a second referendum, declining to recommit to the idea and warning that Australians will not want a referendum for some time. The policy will be reviewed by the Coalition senators Kerrynne Liddle and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and leading no campaigner. While the opposition seeks to maximise the political damage by blaming the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, Labor faces calls for an accelerated rollout of the remaining elements of the Uluru statement from the heart, truth telling and treaty making, and an emphasis on practical solutions to close the gap in Indigenous outcomes. The federal cabinet will meet to discuss the Albanese government's next steps to address Indigenous disadvantage, with senior government figures favouring an interim listening mechanism to provide advice directly to the prime minister. Dutton said: We said that the question put to the Australian people should have been on recognition and dropped the voice because people supported recognition but not the voice. The prime minister did not do that. The prime minister embarked on a divisive path, Dutton told reporters in Canberra. He spent 400m of taxpayers money. He was warned not to go down this path of division and he bears the responsibility for where our country is today. Asked about his policy for a second referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution, Dutton said look, all of our policy ... is going to be reviewed in the process Kerrynne and Jacinta will lead now. I think that is important, but I think it is clear that the Australian public is probably over the referendum process for some time. Dutton said that millions of Australians at the moment are hurting because the prime minister has been completely obsessed with the voice over the course of the last 16 or 17 months. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the referendum was not a vote against reconciliation, the referendum was not a vote against closing the gap. If you look at the way in which both the yes and no cases were argued, we can take from the referendum an increased resolve to act on closing the gap and to act on reconciliation, Marles told reporters in Canberra. And that is really what we need to take forward now, and in a sense of unity across the country. Although more than 60 of Australians voted no to the voice, opponents came to that position from a variety of perspectives: from shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Price's claim that there were no ongoing negative impacts from colonisation, to independent senator Lidia Thorpe's case that a no vote would advance Blak sovereignty. Those contradictions continued on Monday in a train-wreck interview by the leading no campaigner Warren Mundine, who has caused consternation among conservatives by calling for treaties with Australia's First Nations. Asked about his position on treaties, Mundine told Radio National that Indigenous Australians were in one sense recognised through land rights and through native title. Treaty has to be with the traditional owner nations and it is got nothing to do with sovereignty, he claimed, even though recognition of First Nations sovereignty is an integral part of treaties. Mundine appeared to conflate treaties with other agreements struck between groups of Indigenous people and private enterprise, whether it is governments or state and territories, in building roads, building rail ... building houses, or getting projects and mining and energy and agriculture or whatever else. Mundine said that voters did want to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the constitution as the first people of Australia but they rejected the voice. Mundine said that he would love symbolic constitutional recognition and polling suggested that 90 of Australians agreed. But the issue we got, and we all know this, is that that is the leadership of the Aboriginal community ... they do not want it and that so that is going to be a problem. Asked if constitutional recognition would happen, Mundine replied: Well, I do not know to be honest. What we got to do is do something that the government failed to do, that Albanese failed to do, and that is get everyone onboard for things to happen. The influential crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie criticised Indigenous leaders behind the Uluru statement for taking a week of silence to grieve the result. You need to come out and fight now - come out and say to the leader of this country 'what are you going to do for Indigenous communities out there?', Lambie told Sky News. But having a week's break - not on guys, you need to stand your ground now, you need to come out and say 'you have put us on a bloody life support for two years while you have been trying to sell this voice, and in the meantime you have done nothing in the Indigenous communities out there. The Greens have called for the government to establish a national truth and justice commission. Lambie labelled truth-telling a talkfest.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Peter Dutton has dramatically walked back his offer to symbolically recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution.

Two people were killed and three more injured in the Kherson area after more than 100 shells bombarded the region over the weekend, local Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on social media. Two guided bombs later hit key infrastructure in Kherson city, sparking a partial blackout and disruption to the area's water supply, reported the head of the city's military administration, Roman Mrochko. Local officials said two more people had died in the Donetsk area and that a 57-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman had been killed by an airstrike that destroyed their home in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine launched 27 drones in an overnight attack on western Russia, the Russian defense ministry announced, Sunday. Officials said that 18 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, while, they said, two more drones had been shot down over Russia's Belgorod region. They did not detail the fate of the remaining seven drones. Ukrainian media outlets later said that Kyiv's forces had carried out a successful strike on Russia's Krasnaya Yaruga electrical substation, close to the Ukrainian border. The reports could not independently verified. Fierce clashes continued across eastern Ukraine over the weekend, as Russian forces repeatedly tried to encircle the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, military officials said. Illia Yevlash, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's eastern forces, told journalists that Ukrainian forces in the area had faced 10 separate attacks in the space of 24 hours. The enemy is trying to attack us in the direction of Kupiansk to encircle it and reach the banks of the Oskol River, Yevlash told Ukrainian television. He said that Ukrainian forces in the town of Lyman in the Donetsk region had also faced heavy attack. Russian offensive Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that Russian forces are conducting an active defense and are improving their position along the entire length of the line of contact with Ukrainian forces, calling it an active defense. 'And our troops are improving their position at almost the entire area. Quite a large area, Putin said in a video posted to social media by a Kremlin journalist. Russian forces continue to attack Ukrainian positions around the town of Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region in Moscow's largest offensive in months. The General Staff of Ukraine's military said on October 15 its forces had repelled 15 Russian attacks near Avdiivka as well as in Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region. 'The adversary keeps trying to break through Ukrainian defenses, to no success,' it said on Facebook. US military aid The administration of YOU.S. President Joe Biden hopes to push through Congress a new weapons package putting together aid for Israel and Ukraine that will be significantly higher than 2 billion. In an interview on CBS's 'Face the Nation show, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the president will conduct extensive talks with Congress this week on the need for the package to be approved. Biden has been considering a budget request lumping together aid for Israel, Ukraine possibly Taiwan, and the YOU.S. southern border to improve the chances of getting it approved amid calls from some Republicans to cut money for Kyiv. Asked whether the request would be for 2 billion, as has been previously reported, Sullivan said, 'Well, the number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat.' It is not clear how any bill would move through Congress without a speaker of the House of Representatives. Republicans are struggling to pick a speaker after party hardliners ousted Kevin McCarthy nearly two weeks ago. Members must elect a new speaker before they conduct any legislative work. Rail logistics Rail logistics remain a vital component in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the British defense ministry said Sunday in its daily intelligence update, adding that Russia uses its rail system for transportation of ammunition, armor, fuel and personnel into the country. At the same time, it said, rail facilities in occupied parts of Ukraine are vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery, missiles and sabotage. The ministry said Russia almost certainly continues to maintain and improve its rail lines of communication. In addition, the new railway line to Mariupol that Russia is building will shorten delivery time for supplies to the Zaporizhzhia front, according to the ministry's update.

DAILY POST recalls that the police in Borno had on Saturday arrested some personnel of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC). The Police also alleged that the arrested personnel could not identify themselves and accused them of attempting to steal train coaches. The Union, through its National President, Mr Innocent Ajiji, disclosed this while addressing journalists in Jos, the Plateau State capital, on Sunday. Ajiji, who faulted the move, maintained that the arrested persons were bonafide personnel of the corporation. He explained that the coaches were being moved to Jos for the commencement of train services by NRC in Plateau. I am in Jos to monitor the ongoing activities because the Plateau State Government has the intention of running a rail mass transit that will cover Jos, Kuru and Heipang areas. But we do not have any coach in Jos, and as a result, coaches are being conveyed from Maiduguri to be refurbished and used to run the mass transit here. The remaining coaches will be taken to another location because railway management has the intention to run inter-state mass transit. The first coach has arrived in Jos by road and this is because our tracks have been stolen, and we cannot convey the coaches by rail, he said. The president alleged that its members were arrested at the point of conveying the coaches on the directive of Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno State. He explained that the persons arrested were acting on the directive of the management of NRC, adding that it officially wrote to the Commissioner of Police in Borno State, notifying him of the need to convey its items from Maiduguri to Jos. Our members went to Maiduguri to convey three other coaches to Jos, but the police arrested them, and as we speak, they are in custody. All efforts to release them proved abortive. The police alleged that those coaches were stolen, but that is not true. The person they are alleging that he is the prime suspect is Engr Aliyu Mainasara, our Regional District Manager in the North-East. He is not a thief and so we call on the commissioner to immediately release our members, and we will be forced to down tools and stop all trains all over Nigeria from moving if this is not done, he said. Ajiji also explained that the coaches have not been put to use for the past 20 years, insisting that they were being transferred to Jos for proper utilisation. Since Boko Haram started, all our tracks were carted away by the insurgents; our bridges were all also destroyed. In fact, from Maiduguri to Bajoga, there is no single track on the ground because they have been carted away by these criminals. So, we are bringing these coaches to Jos and other places to put them to proper use, he said.

Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has now received a report about the blaze on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park on Tuesday. Andrew Hopkinson, chief fire officer for Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said up to 1,500 vehicles were inside the car park at the time of the fire. In a statement, the airport said it is 'unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable' but this was 'still in the process of being assessed'. One hundred firefighters spent 12 hours battling the inferno at the airport's Terminal Car Park Two when the 20million block was engulfed by flames and caved in just before 9pm this week. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has received a report about the blaze on level three of the airport's Terminal Car Park on Tuesday This week's fire rapidly engulfed the parking structure, which had 1,500 cars in at the time The fire caused part of the car park to completely collapse and left the structure unsafe to enter The airport said it had provided the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) with the registration details of 1,405 vehicles and, along with its parking provider APCOA, it had responded to almost 16,500 customer queries since the fire. The car park remains closed after the blaze caused it to partially collapse, and it was revealed on Saturday that no-one can access the structure safely, making it impossible to properly assess the damage done. It has been extensively damaged by the fire, with debris of cars piled up within the blackened structure. The airport's Dart rail transit system, which opened earlier this year, remains closed. Investigators believe the blaze was started when a diesel car, thought to be a Range Rover, suffered an electrical fault or leaking fuel line. In a statement, London Luton Airport apologised to customers with vehicles in the car park, which is a five-minute walk from the airport's terminal. It said: 'We understand the distress this incident has caused for our car parking customers, and that many are still anxious for more detail. Luton Airport has said it is unlikely that any vehicles in the car park will be salvageable Hundreds of car were destroyed after a Range Rover caught alight, with the blaze rapidly spreading to nearby vehicles A pile of debris at the Luton Airport car park following the shocking fire 'We are sorry that we have not been able to respond as quickly as we would have liked.'

The airport said the emergency services have handed back control of the site and it is working to make it safe. It is likely that Terminal Car Park 2, which was built in 2019 at a cost of 20million, will now have to be demolished. Experts believe that if it had been fitted with an effective sprinkler system, the fire could have been stopped from spreading, leading only to localised damage. A government source confirmed to MailOnline that they are 'undertaking a major review of the fire safety guidance to the building regulations, including research on the fire resistance of car parks'. The fire was so severe that the airport had to be completely closed while firefighters tackled it Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service battled the fire for hours before it was under control The car park is severely damaged after the huge blaze which erupted on Tuesday evening A London Luton Airport spokesperson said: 'We recognise this has been an extremely distressing time for all concerned and we would like to thank our customers for their ongoing patience and understanding while we work through the many complexities following this incident.

Then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed Trump's warnings that Huawei posed a grave security risk to the West -- and defied his threat that the YOU.S. would curb intelligence sharing with allies who let the Chinese company build their future mobile networks. Germany will not exclude a company simply because it is from a certain country, Merkel declared at global policy conference in Berlin in March 2019. What followed was a burst of lucrative contracts between the Chinese tech giant and German telecommunications firms: Huawei is in the midst of constructing 5G infrastructure throughout the country, connecting Germany with Europe and the YOU.S. Now, however, is a season of worry and regret on both sides of the Atlantic. The Biden administration told POLITICO and WELT, a German national daily newspaper, it is as resolute as its predecessor in its belief that the infrastructure being built by Huawei in Germany renders a key NATO ally vulnerable to cyberattacks and data theft. But it is largely pressing its case against Huawei behind closed doors, in the belief that Trump's brash diplomacy backfired in Berlin. Meanwhile, the Berlin establishment is not dismissing YOU.S. warnings about Huawei -- or China -- anymore. Shocked when Russia's invasion of Ukraine cost the country its natural-gas lifeline, Germans are suddenly alert to the risks that emerge when business partners become geopolitical enemies. Unlike five years ago, they increasingly warn that there is no technical solution to the risks posed by heavy reliance on the Chinese firm. Two senior German intelligence officials, granted anonymity to discuss confidential matters, told POLITICO and WELT that they now believe that Huawei's dominance of Germany's fourth- and fifth-generation radio access networks represents a major threat to their country's security. To believe that the installation of Huawei technology is unproblematic is infinite naivety, one senior German intelligence official said in an interview. The official did not specify the risks Germany's heavy reliance on Huawei gear poses. But YOU.S. officials have long warned that the firm's telecommunications equipment provides a springboard for Beijing to siphon off confidential data or sabotage the critical services that increasingly rely on civilian mobile networks, like self-driving cars, autonomous machinery or -- for a NATO ally like Germany -- sensitive military and diplomatic communications. Those who dismiss the risks of using Huawei gear lack the imagination of what is possible in the field of cyber espionage, the official said. Those warnings have intensified in severity and broadened in scope since 2019, an investigation by POLITICO and WELT has found. But there is serious concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Huawei -- which has a multibillion-euro business in Germany -- is already so embedded in German telecommunications networks that the government will resist taking strong action against it. Current and former officials tell a story of how growing mistrust within the transatlantic alliance strengthened Germany's resistance to taking direction from Washington, while the country's political class followed its longstanding instinct that business dealings can be separated from geopolitical concerns. The officials point to dysfunctional relationships among the leaders of the alliance: Merkel's distaste for Trump -- which was shared by many leaders across the German political landscape -- seemed to blind her to the fact that his warnings about Huawei should be taken seriously. And Trump's own desire for the spotlight and his failure to cultivate the kind of confidential relationships that have helped to maintain the YOU.S.-European alliance for decades set the stage for conflict rather than cooperation. For its part, Huawei -- whose European headquarters is in Germany -- vigorously denies the notion that its gear is uniquely vulnerable to subversion, and that it is beholden to Beijing. Huawei has been operating in Germany for over 20 years and is a reliable supplier of innovative technologies with a very good cybersecurity record. Huawei is one of the most open, most evaluated and transparent technology companies in the world, Patrick Berger, head of media affairs for Huawei, said in an email. But many German lawmakers and government officials now regularly bemoan the close commercial ties between Huawei and the country's three major mobile operators: Deutsche Telekom, Telefnica, and Vodafone. Our own security interests were ignored for far too long, Norbert Rttgen, a conservative lawmaker in the German parliament, known as Bundestag, said in an interview. We would have saved time and money if the security policy dimension of Huawei had been the focus from the beginning. In March, Germany's Interior Ministry launched a probe of gear made by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese equipment maker, in the country's telecommunications networks, and signaled the review could lead to tighter restrictions on the two companies. A leaked draft plan now circulating among the German government would require the country's mobile operators to significantly cut back their reliance on Huawei gear and ban it completely from sensitive parts of the network. But some are calling for more drastic action. I advocate for a complete abandonment of Huawei technology in the entire German mobile network, Maximilian Funke-Kaiser, member of parliament for the FDP, which is part of the coalition government of Merkel's successor, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said in an interview. The Biden administration, too, is hoping to see the country significantly curb its reliance on Huawei gear, or phase it out altogether. Senior administration officials maintain that it has consistently pressured Scholz's government to take strong action -- but quietly, behind the scenes. Pounding your fists on the table and saying, 'My way or the highway,' is not always the most effective diplomatic strategy, a senior official in the YOU.S. State Department, granted anonymity to discuss a matter of national security, told POLITICO. But make no mistake, the pressure, if anything, has ramped up. Still, Germany's ties to both Huawei and China are substantial, and multiple current and former officials interviewed by POLITICO and WELT expressed skepticism of the country's willingness to take decisive action in defiance of their own tech and telecom companies, or of Biden's willingness to press the issue. China has been Germany's largest trade partner for seven years running, with bilateral trade volumes reaching almost 334 billion in 2022. Last December, a blistering EU-wide study estimated that German mobile operators had sourced 59 percent of the gear in their 5G radio access networks and 57 percent in their 4G networks from Huawei and ZTE. Those dependencies have led the country's mobile providers to warn that removing Huawei equipment nationwide would hamper German economic growth, costing roughly four-to-five billion euros. There is also a fear that strong action on Huawei could invite blowback from China -- and not without good reason. In December 2019, China's then-German ambassador, Wu Ken, threatened consequences if Berlin excluded Huawei from the German market. And in response to a request for comment on this story, a spokesperson for China's German embassy largely reiterated those warnings. If Germany unjustly excludes Chinese companies ... without providing evidence that Chinese products pose a security threat to Germany, we will not stand idly by, the spokesperson wrote in a statement. Germany is in a bad position to take an economic hit, as many analysts believe it is in the second year of a recession. Most of YOU.S.'s closest allies have banned or restricted Huawei. That includes all five members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership -- the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, along with the YOU.S. -- and Japan, Taiwan and France. The European Commission is also urging more EU countries to curb the firm's access to their markets, with 10 EU countries having done so already. Matthew Turpin, a former director for China on Trump's National Security Council, conceded that Trump's confrontational approach to Germany was self-defeating. But like other current and former officials in Berlin and Washington interviewed for this story, he expressed doubts that Germany may be truly on the cusp of making a big change, or that the YOU.S. has enough leverage to get what it wanted. It was clear to me always that the Germans were actually not afraid we would cut off intelligence to them, said Turpin, now a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. But when the Chinese ambassador in Berlin says, 'You know, it would be a shame if something happened to the German automobile companies,' they do believe that threat, he said. Lindsay Gorman, a former senior adviser on technology issues for the Biden administration's National Security Council, agreed that Trump's approach to Germany backfired. But Gorman, who is now head of technology and geopolitics at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, questioned whether Biden's behind-the-scenes lobbying would be enough to overcome dogged pushback from German industry. The stakes could not be higher when it comes to Germany because ... we are not just talking about one layer of digital infrastructure, we are talking about a full technology stack that gets built on top of it, she said, pointing to Huawei's investments in biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and surveillance technology. If China has an advantage in the infrastructure layer, that confers an advantage in all the other application layers that are built on top of it, Gorman continued. And that is why this decision is so critical. The Trump administration launched its pressure campaign against Huawei in 2018 due to three overlapping concerns. The first was that Beijing could siphon off or sabotage any data passing through Huawei's networks, since it wielded legal authority over the company. Second, mobile operators across the globe were on the verge of upgrading their networks to 5G. The transition would radically expand the amount of information and variety of services -- from smart grids to smart cars -- that would depend on the antennas and base stations companies like Huawei manufactured. Finally, backed by dirt-cheap prices and increasingly competitive manufacturing, Huawei was gobbling up contracts to build those networks across the globe -- thus extending the risks of data theft and cyber-physical disruption deeper into the capitals of key YOU.S. allies, like Berlin. YOU.S. and EU officials assert Huawei could only offer those bargain deals due to China's aggressive state subsidies -- a claim the firm denies. Still, as Huawei edged out Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson for highly specialized equipment contracts everywhere from London to Amsterdam to Norway, YOU.S. officials started to worry that Europe's two leading telco giants would fall hopelessly behind, eventually leaving the continent with nowhere to turn but Huawei. Having a Chinese company that is strongly susceptible to the Communist Party of China leading the globe in a foundational technology was not only a security problem, but a major economic problem, Josh Cartin, a former NSC staffer during the Trump administration, said in an interview. Because the YOU.S. boasted no direct competitors to Huawei, the Trump administration leaned into the idea that its pressure campaign would benefit two European firms, Nokia and Ericsson. To its surprise, that pitch fell flat in Berlin, the heart of the European solidarity project. The Germans did not even seem to bat an eyelash at the Ericsson and Nokia argument, said Josh Steinman, the former senior director for cyber policy on Trump's national security council. Germans felt their telecommunications network was an embarrassment, Steinman said, and that Huawei's bargain deals offered the quickest route to fixing that. Economically speaking, they may have had a point. By 2018, Huawei already had a large footprint in Germany's older telecommunications networks. Barring it from the nation's 5G -- as the YOU.S. wanted -- meant mobile operators would slowly have to phase out older Huawei equipment, too. Legacy gear from one equipment maker often is not compatible with newer equipment from another. A Huawei-commissioned study from Oxford University in December 2019 estimated that excluding the firm from Germany's 5G rollout would cost Berlin 7 billion dollars over fifteen years. A separate study by GSMA, a mobile industry trade group that includes Huawei, projected that a Huawei 5G ban would cost European operators 62 billion. Those figures were significantly inflated to scare off a ban, YOU.S. officials and some telecommunications industry experts believe. But they were not completely without merit. And either way, they had currency in Germany, where one of the country's largest mobile operators, Deutsche Telekom, is partially state-owned. Germany had a huge install base of 2G, 3G and 4G Huawei in their networks, said Sue Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump. And so what we were asking them to do is basically rip and replace. And that is a big deal. If Trump was asking a lot of the Germans, he did the same elsewhere across Europe. And in Prague, Paris, and -- after significant hesitation -- London, YOU.S. allies agreed the risks stemming from Huawei gear could only be addressed through targeted restrictions against it. Often, the costs of boxing the firm out of 5G networks were not nearly as bad as the firm had warned. A key difference in Germany was that Berlin did not see the YOU.S. as an honest broker when it came to spying. Trump's warnings about Huawei really did not work with the Germans because they were like, 'No, hang on. We are not so sure about this. What about all your spying?' said Janka Oertel, the director of the Asia programme and a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. In 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden showed that the National Security Agency had tapped Merkel's phone, a revelation that still rankled in Berlin. In the fall of 2019, Merkel announced that the country would not bar Huawei from participating in its 5G rollout. Berlin instead adopted stricter, vendor-agnostic security criteria for equipment suppliers -- a compromise that YOU.S. officials argued was inadequate. The Germans defended their approach, in part, by arguing that the YOU.S. had no evidence Huawei did anything wrong. For such serious decisions like a ban, you need proof, Arne Schnbohm, Germany's then-top cybersecurity official, told news weekly Spiegel in December of 2018. For Americans, that argument missed the point. Everyone got hung up on the notion of a smoking gun, said Gordon. YOU.S. officials saw Huawei as more akin to a loaded gun, the type of weapon Beijing would only exploit in a crisis. To support that argument, Gordon and other former officials said, they often pointed to a 2017 law that requires Chinese tech companies to support the Communist Party's intelligence gathering efforts. Huawei denies that that law -- China's 2017 National Intelligence Law -- mandates that it assist the country's intelligence services. Huawei has obtained various legal opinions on the subject, all of which agree that it is not subject to any legal provisions that could bring it into conflict with German laws, Berger, the Huawei spokesperson, said in an email. Lacking the proof YOU.S. officials insisted would not come until it was too late, the Germans were reluctant to come down hard on Huawei. YOU.S. officials believed Berlin's enormous economic dependency on China was a key obstacle. By 2020, German automakers Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW were selling more cars in China than anywhere else in the world. That made Berlin especially sensitive to fears of Chinese retaliation. German policy towards China has always been primarily industrial policy, said Rttgen, the conservative lawmaker. During the Trump years, Germany did not want to antagonize China and thus provoke disadvantages for the German automotive industry, which China openly threatened. Gordon agrees. Part of their unstated concern, we always believed, was the economic damage that would be imposed by China as a retribution for walking away from Huawei, she said. For Turpin, the former NSC official, Germany's apprehensions of Chinese bullying were proof of the very point the YOU.S. was trying to make. Whether it was blunt economic pressure or technically sophisticated cyberattacks, relying heavily on Huawei meant making yourself vulnerable to Chinese coercion. For the Germans to continue to tell us, well, we need a smoking gun, we have not seen intelligence, suggests that they are being just completely obtuse, he said. Turpin and other Trump administration officials believe it was difficult to convey that message, in part, due to the Germans' bitter dislike for Trump and his high-pressure style of diplomacy. Since he entered office, Trump had berated Germany and other NATO allies as free riders because they failed to fulfill the alliance target of spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense. He also frequently threatened to levy a 20 percent tariff on European car imports -- a potentially crippling blow to Germany's auto industry, and a threat that looked an awful lot like the one YOU.S. officials were suggesting could come from China. Merkel is looking at this through the lens of, first of all, I am not going to side with Donald Trump. And second of all, I am not going to jeopardize our economic relationship with Beijing, he said. It was that type of behavior from the YOU.S. president that turned Germans into some of the world's foremost Trump critics by the end of 2019. A survey published that December by British research firm YouGov found that roughly two-fifths of Germans believed Trump was the world's most dangerous world leader, even ranking above North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Still, the Trump administration was not shy about browbeating the Germans on Huawei. In March 2019, Trump's then-ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, wrote a letter to the German Minister of Economic Affairs threatening to curb intelligence sharing with Berlin unless it excluded Huawei from the pending rollout of its 5G networks. In it, Grenell warned that the 2017 law meant Beijing could force Huawei and ZTE to share confidential information that passed through their German networks, potentially compromising sensitive defense and intelligence data belonging to NATO. The letter, which leaked to reporters, was followed by repeated public warnings from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, when the two were in Germany. Those early efforts failed because we were going around the world, banging on the table like the ugly American, and saying, 'Do not buy Huawei,' said Keith Krach, who began as Trump's under secretary of state for economic affairs in June 2019. Like Turpin, Krach believes the bluntness of the Trump team's early appeals backfired. After he came into his role, he tried to develop a positive vision of how German industry could benefit by reducing its reliance on Huawei, he said. But Steinman, Trump's senior director for cyber policy on his national security council, pushed back against the idea that the administration's vocal approach was foolhardy. When one of your major trading partners, when one of your major military allies, is doing things that are contrary to their national interest -- and as an ally, things that are contrary to yours, too -- you say something, he said. I would not call that brash, I would call that honest. Whatever the reason, Turpin said he realized how difficult it would be to move the Germans off Huawei during a trip to Berlin in May 2019. After a day of meetings with his German counterparts, Turpin's hosts brought him to a rooftop bar overlooking the city's Kaiser-Wilhelm Memorial Church. The church, which had been leveled during a World War II bombing raid, later became a symbol of Germany's commitment to avoiding the sins of its Nazi past. But the view that day featured a perverse twist: The church's new tower had been covered in an enormous, 360-degree advertisement for Huawei. The idea that a solemn monument that is supposed to look at the full crimes and challenges of the Second World War had turned into an advertisement for Huawei, it was like, 'Guys, this is what we mean,' Turpin said. The ground beneath Huawei began to shift in Germany in February 2022, virtually the same day Russian tanks rolled across the border of Ukraine. Moscow's unprovoked invasion brought war practically to Germany's doorstep. China's refusal to condemn it did not sit well in Berlin. The Ukraine invasion has prompted this realization in Germany that depending on autocrats for critical infrastructure is just not sustainable, said Gorman, the former member of Biden's national security council. China's response to the invasion has greatly clarified the Huawei issue across Europe, added the senior State Department official. It is not lost on people that in Europe's hour of need, China declared a 'no limits friendship' with Putin. China's tacit support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed Germany to pare back its enormous economic dependence on China. In July, the German government released its first-ever China strategy, a 61-page document that labeled China a systemic rival -- one of the first official acknowledgements that Beijing was not just an engine of GDP growth for Berlin. On Huawei specifically, the war also hardened the German intelligence community's assessment of its ability to manage the risks of the firm's telecommunications gear. Merkel and the former German cybersecurity chief, Schnbohm, had previously argued that mobile operators could mitigate the risks of using Huawei gear through rigorous testing and security monitoring, especially of equipment used in the most critical part of the network, known as the core. The country's three major mobile operators moved to limit how heavily they used Huawei gear for their core, while turning unreservedly to the firm to build out the antennas and base stations that constitute the mobile radio access networks, or (RAN). In older telecommunications networks, RAN was regarded as less sensitive because it relayed -- but did not process or store -- data. But the arrival of 5G meant the edge of a network was beginning to feature the same computing capabilities as its nerve-center-like core, eroding the security distinction between the two. YOU.S. officials made this point forcefully during the Trump administration and German intelligence officials are increasingly agreeing today. In separate interviews for this story, the two senior German intelligence officials likened the country's continued reliance on Huawei RAN to its disastrous investment in the Russian natural gas pipeline, Nord Stream II. Berlin once saw the 11 billion pipeline as a central pillar of its energy future. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced Germany to cancel the contract, validating repeated YOU.S. warnings that Berlin should not place its economic fortunes in the hands of autocratic governments, like the Kremlin. Germany's digital dependency on Huawei could have even more serious consequences than Nord Stream II because it could provide a springboard for Beijing to sabotage German infrastructure, not just coerce the country economically, the second intelligence official said. Even as Berlin has soured on China, some within Germany still view the warnings about Huawei with intense skepticism. German security authorities have presented alleged evidence of vulnerabilities in Huawei gear to German parliamentarians only one time, during a classified session of the Bundestag's Digital Committee in April, two individuals familiar with the meeting told POLITICO and WELT. At the meeting, security officials warned lawmakers about a vulnerability in a Huawei component in the antenna network responsible for energy management -- the same issue that sparked the German Interior Ministry's probe into gear made by Huawei and ZTE. But two participants at the meeting, granted anonymity due to the classified nature of the session, said the security officials did not confirm whether the vulnerability has ever been exploited or if it was designed to cause significant disruptions. The warnings were purely theoretical, leaving them unsure about the severity of the threat, they said. One German telecommunications industry insider, granted anonymity to speak openly on the matter, called the allegations ridiculous. Huawei also strongly disputes the potential for remote sabotage of its gear. We are not aware of any technically plausible description of how espionage and sabotage would be possible for an equipment supplier via the radio access network, Huawei's Berger said in an email. The equipment supplier has no remote access to the equipment and the data is highly encrypted according to 3GPP standards. Those doubts are one reason Germany's tougher talk on Huawei has not yet been backed up by action. In 2021, under Merkel's leadership, the German parliament passed a new IT security law that for the first time gave the government the power to bar equipment made by untrustworthy telecommunications providers from parts of Germany's mobile network. But the German government has bypassed every opportunity to invoke the law against Huawei or ZTE since then. It has declined three separate opportunities to block new critical components from the Chinese firms from being introduced into critical parts of Germany's mobile network, as documents disclosed in a September parliamentary inquiry revealed. And despite the vocal warnings from YOU.S. and, later, German officials about the reliability of Huawei gear, German industry has signed contract after contract with the firm since Merkel's decision not to ban Huawei from the country's 5G networks. In 2019, Duisburg, a German city, announced plans to collaborate with Huawei for a large-scale smart city project. That same year, Germany's largest mobile operator, Deutsche Telekom, inked a partnership with Huawei that even included special provisions for potential supply chain disruptions resulting from YOU.S. trade restrictions. And as recently as March, Deutsche Bahn, the partially state-owned rail operator, signed a 67 million deal for its digitization. With each new installation, it becomes more difficult to remove these Chinese components from our mobile network, Reinhard Brandl, a member of the opposition CSU party, said in an interview. German mobile operators and others with big investments in Huawei have argued publicly that any policy to rip and replace Huawei gear -- or even phase it out too rapidly -- would be enormously costly. In September, after the leak of a draft plan to require German mobile operators to remove all critical components from Chinese vendors in their 5G core networks and reduce the share of Huawei RAN below 25 percent by 2026, German mobile operators reacted with alarm. Telefonica publicly warned it could seek damages and legal action if the plan went into effect. Stephan Broszio, a spokesperson for Deutsche Telekom, called the interior ministry's timeline for replacing Huawei gear completely unrealistic. In general, we do not understand why German mobile customers, who benefit from one of the best 5G networks in Europe, should be unnecessarily subjected to significant quality losses, Broszio wrote in an email. Barclays has estimated a requirement to replace all Huawei RAN would cost all three major mobile operators 2.6 billion. The German national railway company Deutsche Bahn, whose deal with Huawei covers a different mobile communications technology than 5G, has said a blanket ban on its gear would cost it 420 million. Oertel, the European Council on Foreign Relations expert, argued that Germany's mobile operators knew that by investing so heavily and so quickly in Huawei for their 5G rollout, they would make a ban more difficult. But she said she holds the government accountable as well. The government thought that by signaling we are potentially banning Huawei, maybe then operators will come to their senses and will not build this in anymore, she said. That did not work. It fell short as a strategy. Gorman, the Biden administration official, said that Huawei's economic foothold made Germany a sticky widget on Huawei. But she argued that it is critical Berlin start reducing its reliance on the firm's equipment as soon as possible. Unfortunately, these networks take so long to change, it is almost harder to turn them off than to reverse course on something like Nord Stream II, she said. And that is why the planning needs to happen now, before we get into a crisis scenario. The State Department official sounded a similar sense of urgency. In a 30-nation alliance that is really predicated on having some degree of information and intelligence symmetry, we simply cannot afford for there to be a soft underbelly to the alliance from an information and intelligence sharing standpoint, the official said. Unfortunately, in places like Germany, the official wrote later in an email, warnings from government security services have not decisively moved the needle for industry. Current and former Biden administration officials say that their quiet pressure campaign has translated to tougher EU action on Huawei. Asked for specifics about their diplomacy, the senior State Department official said the White House has put Germany's close ties with Huawei front and center during the four ministerial-level meetings of the EU-YOU.S. Trade and Technology Council since 2021, a Biden-era initiative to coordinate transatlantic trade and investment policy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and YOU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai have attended each ministerial meeting, where they met with European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager. The TTC also features 10 working groups dedicated to specific issues in the YOU.S.-EU relationship, one of which is telecommunications. The National Security Council and the Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The European Commission responded by referring to its recent actions against Huawei and ZTE -- which the State Department official also highlighted as evidence YOU.S. diplomacy was having an impact. In June, the commission found that the two Chinese firms represent ... materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers. In recent years, it has regularly shone a spotlight on Germany and smaller EU states that have been struggling to remove Huawei gear. Publicly, cabinet-level officials within the Biden administration -- and the president himself -- have not talked nearly as much about Huawei as their predecessors in the White House. Several former YOU.S. officials, including Gorman, Steinman and Ivan Kanapathy, the deputy senior director for Asian affairs on Trump's NSC, question whether Biden's quiet outreach to Germany is sufficient to move the needle on Huawei. When only lower-level officials are talking about these types of problems, it has dramatically less impact than when someone at a much higher level is doing it, said Kanapathy. Skeptics of Biden's diplomacy are still more likely to blame Berlin than Washington for Germany's continued ties to Huawei. Even if it is less laser-focused on Huawei than Trump was, they acknowledge, the Biden administration has kept the heat on Chinese tech companies, from cutting off their access to advanced semiconductors to restricting Western investment in cutting-edge tech, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In August, however, Huawei started advertising a new smartphone that included an advanced, 7-nanometer chip. That breakthrough is raising sharper criticisms of Biden's approach to the telecommunications giant, even if many believe the development is not as impressive as China wants it to appear. In September, a group of ten Republican Congressmen sent a letter to the Commerce Department urging it to slap heavier sanctions on China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which manufactures the new chip, and Huawei. If enacted, those measures could potentially raise the price of Huawei gear and short-circuit the Huawei debate in Germany. But Krach, one of relatively few Trump administration officials who has continued to support the Biden administration's Huawei push since leaving his government, said the firm would remain a significant long-term threat to YOU.S. interests, no matter what happens with YOU.S. trade and export policy. When you have a competitor like Huawei, you could drive a stake into their heart, put them 10-feet underground, throw asphalt on them, and light them on fire -- and they will still come back, he said.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Former President Trump's crusade to pressure YOU.S. allies into banning the Chinese tech company Huawei ran into a wall of resistance in Berlin. Now, however, is a season of worry and regret on both sides of the Atlantic. The Biden administration told POLITICO and WELT, a German national daily newspaper, it is as resolute as its predecessor in its belief that the infrastructure being built by Huawei in Germany renders a key NATO ally vulnerable to cyberattacks and data theft. Unlike five years ago, they increasingly warn that there is no technical solution to the risks posed by heavy reliance on the Chinese firm.","{'BART': {'general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends': 0.36406025290489197, 'personal or small scale isolated event and news': 0.2794663906097412, 'other news': 0.18961098790168762, 'warehouse and storage facilities disruption or destruction news': 0.040720485150814056, 'major maritime transportation disruption news': 0.03253775089979172, 'severe and extreme weather news ': 0.028759624809026718, 'major railway transportation disruption news': 0.025195933878421783, 'major and large scale worker strike actions': 0.022194160148501396, 'major air transportation disruption news': 0.0174543559551239}}","general social, business, economic reports, studies and trends",personal or small scale isolated event and news

And the mainstream media suffered a collective conniption. What will they ever find to write or complain about? (On second thought, give them a few days to circle in on another victim.) He leaves office with the latest poll indicating a commanding two-party preferred lead for Labor of 56.5-43.5 -- an increase on its 55-45 lead at the last election. Unsurprisingly, Andrews has done it in his own time and on his own terms -- a feature of his premiership. Not for Andrews the wishy-washy, let us try to please everybody, starting with the media, approach. He knew - as all progressive politicians would do well to note - there is no pleasing Australia's rabid media cabal. Back when the state needed to come together during COVID, the Murdoch-led rags and shock jocks sided with the Liberal Opposition rabble to attack every state public health measure. Matthew Guy, the cookers and the bloody uproar against Dan Andrews Matthew Guy's Liberals, their cooker friends and accompanying media protection racket have run a cheap anti-Dan Andrews election campaign in Victoria, but will it make a difference? Of course, the more Andrews refused to engage with their relentless attacks, the more enraged the media mafia became. They ramped up the crazy to collaborate with cookers. They invented conspiracy theories on a daily basis, contriving wild sub-plots of cover-ups behind everything from the serious accident in which Andrews suffered a broken back to a car accident involving his wife back in 2013. And proving once and for all that the national broadcaster can mix it with the right-wing media gang, ABC's News Breakfast chose UAP Senator Ralph Babet, along with The Australian's Rachel Baxendale to share their insights on Andrews' departure. Baxendale's blatantly hateful and puerile attacks on the Victorian Premier became a regular feature of Spring Street press conferences. The Murdoch employee refers to those Victorians who reelected Andrews for a third time with an increased majority as the Dan Andrews cult and will likely win a Walkley for her incisive interviewing skills. Such as when she asked the Premier why intimate partners did not have to wear masks when others did, to which Andrews patiently responded: The very nature of a platonic relationship between two people who are coming together to spend time with each other, that is very different to intimate partners who by the very virtue of the fact that they are intimate partners, their contact is of a different nature. I cannot quite believe I am having to explain that. But I am. And this inspired line of questioning: BAXENDALE: I have been told that then-Victorian deputy chief health officer Allen Cheng has resigned, is that true? ANDREWS: No, that is not true. BAXENDALE: But you said he was taking some time off, surely you can see that looks like he is resigned, would not you agree? ANDREWS: No, that is just not correct. Cheng took a total of one week's leave. Brilliant interrogations such as these notwithstanding, Dan Andrews somehow managed to turn up every day during the pandemic. He fronted a hostile press pack, enduring what can only be described as feral attacks on a daily basis. He faced an Opposition focused on getting the dirt on the Premier instead of providing a credible alternative government. There were death threats from emboldened far-right nut jobs. And a bellicose Federal Coalition Government and later, Opposition, who, even as late as this month, blamed Andrews for all that is wrong with the nation - nay, the world - plus a couple of things that probably have not happened yet. It was an unrelenting, coordinated misinformation campaign, in which conservative forces threw everything they had at the Victorian Premier for nine years, insisting Victorians wanted him out. And the more unhinged their attacks towards him while Andrews stared them down, the more voters turned away from the whole circus, returning the Andrews Government to power with an increased majority each time. Dan Andrews 'right to go' for third term Despite conservative media relentlessly campaigning against his success, Daniel Andrews' potential re-election in November would make him Victoria's longest-serving premier since 1972. It has been a long-held position of this publication that all non-conservative, let alone progressive, politicians should stop cosying up to their tormentors. It only ends in tears. With the announcement of Rupert Murdoch's retirement this week, sitting Labor MPs, while they have not waxed lyrical about the man, have hardly been openly critical, with many choosing to give him credit for building a media empire. Which is a bit like thanking Dr No for creating jobs for MI6. It would have been refreshing to see a sitting Labor MP step up and acknowledge what only ex-PMs, like Malcolm Turnbull (though not while he was Prime Minister), seem bold enough to admit about the media mogul. Turnbull listed the YOU.S. Capitol insurrection, the Trump Presidency and climate change denial among the many terrifying consequences of Murdoch's involvement, and described his legacy as one which: ...has done enormous damage to the democratic world. Turnbull also noted, unlike many of his party's ebullient praise for the Murdoch dynasty, that the passing of Rupert's media monstrosity helm to son Lachlan, will probably not see any change for the better. An accurate if sobering thought. Andrews leaves the top job in the state as the fourth-longest-serving Victorian premier. His legacy is one of significant social reforms such as a Treaty with Indigenous Victorians, the Safe Schools program and Voluntary Assisted Dying legislation. The Andrews Government infrastructure program has transformed Victoria and included the revival of the State Electricity Commission, the metro rail link, railway level crossing removals, the suburban rail loop, a range of road extensions and upgrades, plus a comprehensive plan to build 800,000 affordable homes over ten years. Andrews' policy platform actively embraced renewable energies rather than fossil fuels and, in a first for Australia, permanently banned fracking and coal seam gas exploration. Most recently, the Victorian Premier decided to scrap the outdated Commonwealth Games and ignored the backlash, saying simply: What is become clear is that the cost of hosting these Games in 2026 is not the 2.6 billion, which was budgeted and allocated... I will not take money out of hospitals and schools to host an event that is three times the cost estimated and budgeted for last year. But not everyone will agree with that. Of course, Andrews is not the only successful Labor leader in recent history to have survived the Murdochracy. Mark McGowan, the WA Labor Premier who all but destroyed the Liberal Opposition in that state, such that they almost did not qualify as a political party, had a similar approach to Andrews. He, too, led on his own terms, sticking to the plan and letting that state's media ramble on without effect until he was good and ready to stand down. Interestingly, neither leader can be said to be a beacon of radicalism, which hints at the level of progress Australians are happy to embrace. Nonetheless, Andrews and McGowan are tangible evidence that Australians are sick of spin. They are tired of being played by the Murdochs and Costellos and Stokes' of the world and they are fed up with political grifters who suck up to them for personal gain. Voters want political leaders who prioritise decisions based on the needs of the people, not to placate media moguls and assorted corporations. But not everyone will agree with that.

At his farm in northeastern Nigeria, he can no longer afford enough fertilizer, so his corn is stunted and pale, the scraggly plants bending toward the powdery earth. Inside his mud house, he has grown accustomed to explaining to his two young children and pregnant wife why they must make do with two meals a day -- and sometimes only one -- even as hunger gnaws. As he and his neighbors commiserate over the calamity unfolding across much of Africa, they exchange theories on one source of trouble: Russia's war on Ukraine, which disrupted shipments of key ingredients for fertilizer. We are in two different worlds, separated by airplanes and oceans, Mr. Chubado said. How can it be affecting us here? That question is reverberating in many lower-income countries. Farmers are grappling with shocks that made fertilizer scarce and unaffordable, diminishing harvests, raising food prices and spreading hunger. The war in Ukraine reduced the region's grain exports and sent the price of staples like wheat soaring from Egypt to Indonesia. The world's food supply is also menaced by the ravages of climate change -- heat waves, drought, floods. Now, scarce and expensive fertilizer is combining with these other forces to threaten livelihoods. The breakdown in fertilizer production challenges the orthodoxy that has dominated international trade for decades. Prominent economists have promoted globalization as insurance against upheaval. When factories in one place cannot produce goods, they can be summoned from somewhere else. Yet as farmers across Africa and parts of Asia contend with fertilizer shortages, their anguish attests to a less celebrated aspect of the interlinked economy: Shared dependence on vital products from dominant suppliers yields widespread danger when shocks emerge. The crisis started with the Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the cost of transporting fertilizer ingredients. Then came the war. Finally, over the last 18 months, the YOU.S. Federal Reserve aggressively lifted interest rates to choke off domestic inflation. That has lifted the value of the American dollar against many currencies. Because fertilizer components are priced in dollars, they have become vastly more expensive in countries like Nigeria. Since February 2022, the price of fertilizer has more than doubled in Nigeria and 13 other countries, according to a survey by ActionAid, an international relief group. Concern about food insecurity has been alarmingly high in much of West and Central Africa, according to a World Bank bulletin. In Nigeria alone, Africa's most populous country, nearly 90 million people -- roughly two-fifths of the nation -- suffer from insufficient food consumption, according to data from the World Food Program. In conversations with three dozen people engaged in growing crops, trading food and distributing fertilizer in northeastern Nigeria, a sense of bewilderment is palpable alongside desperation. Farmers are shifting from growing staples like rice and corn to less valuable crops like soybeans and peanuts, which require less fertilizer. Thieves are stealing harvests. Wives are leaving husbands and returning to families with greater access to food. Parents are pulling children out of school for a lack of tuition money. Upward mobility has yielded to the imperative to hang on. Mr. Chubado, 27, is eager to send his children to university. He typically uses some of his crop to feed his family while selling the rest to raise cash. Yet with no extra crop to sell this year, he recently moved his 10-year-old son, Abubakar, from a private school where classes are no larger than 20 to a government school where 70 children crowd into classrooms. He cannot afford to buy the usual three school uniforms, so Abubakar must make do with one. Some days, his son complains that his uniform is too dirty and refuses to go to school. The Pandemic Shock Faced with extraordinary prices for inorganic or commercial fertilizers, some farmers are shifting to organic varieties, including animal manure. Longer term, that is better for soil, food quality and public health, experts say. But it can take years for crops grown with organic fertilizers to approach the yields achieved through the use of commercial varieties. In Nigeria, home to more than 220 million people, the highest priority is the immediate pursuit of additional food. At least for now, inorganic fertilizers remain a crucial means of adding vital nutrients like nitrogen and potassium to soils. Inorganic fertilizer is a global enterprise, one dominated by producers in the United States, China, India, Russia, Canada and Morocco. Nigeria has several fertilizer factories that produce varieties of nitrogen fertilizer, but they export nearly everything to South America. As a result, the country is vulnerable to any break in the global supply chain. The pandemic delivered a colossal blow. When making and blending fertilizer, Nigeria imports phosphates mined in Morocco, shipping them to the port of Lagos. Over the first two months of the pandemic, as commercial activity froze, shipping companies reduced their ports of call in sub-Saharan Africa by roughly one-fifth, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Then, as regular shipping schedules resumed, Lagos was overwhelmed by a cargo backlog. Seeking easier passage, fertilizer manufacturers diverted shipments to Port Harcourt, about 370 miles down the coast. But rampant piracy in the area entailed higher costs for insurance and freight. In March 2021, a massive container ship ran aground in the Suez Canal, closing that artery of trade and sending global shipping prices skyward. The cost of phosphates from Morocco delivered to Nigeria grew to more than 1,000 per ton, from 300 to 400. You had all those problems compounding supply, said Gideon Negedu, executive secretary of the Fertilizer Producers and Suppliers Association of Nigeria. Then, just as supply was recovering, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Consequences of Conflict For fertilizer producers, the most immediate effect of the war was its impact on energy prices. Nitrogen fertilizers are made through a chemical process that consumes energy, typically natural gas. As the United States, Europe and other governments enforced sanctions against Russia -- a major gas producer -- the price rose. The war also limited access to potash, an important source of potassium. Mining potash is a major industry in Belarus, a Russian ally. Even before the war in Ukraine, Belarus confronted international restrictions on its sales. Russia is another major supplier. American and European sanctions on Russia and Belarus include exemptions intended to allow trade in agricultural commodities. But much of the potash coming out of Belarus -- a landlocked country -- has traditionally been shipped from Lithuania, which has barred rail access since last year. Fertilizer manufacturers could not simply forgo phosphates and make products with the other key nutrients, nitrogen and potassium. Many crops require all three. Mr. Negedu's trade association represents 80 fertilizer blending plants and 500 large distributors around Nigeria. In pursuit of potash, the association pivoted to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, contending with stiff competition from much larger consumers of fertilizer from the United States and India, along with higher shipping rates. For much of last year, a ton of phosphates moved from Canada to Nigeria ran 1,350 -- a roughly fivefold increase over the price before 2020. Scarce Fertilizer In the dusty city of Gombe, Kasim Abubakar, 28, a fertilizer merchant, contemplated his diminishing stocks with a deepening sense of dread. It was July 2022, five months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of the peak season for farmers applying fertilizer. He placed an order for 700 bags of urea -- a form of nitrogen -- with a Nigerian manufacturer. Not until October, four months after the peak season, did he finally receive his shipment. This year, Mr. Abubakar ordered 2,100 bags of NPK, a mixture of the three primary nutrients, from an agribusiness supplier in Lagos. He prepaid the full balance -- 48 million naira, or about 61,000. Several weeks later, a sales manager informed him that production had been halted at the factory. Mr. Abubakar never received his shipment, while waiting four months for a refund. With limited inventory, his sales have dropped by half. In the Gombe area, a shortage of fertilizer worsened. For farmers with enough cash or credit to buy fertilizer, like Mohammed Sambo, 77, this was an opportunity. His 370-acre farm beyond Gombe is home to his four wives, seven children and 40 grandchildren. They live in mud houses that lack electricity and plumbing. Last year, with fertilizer prices climbing, Mr. Sambo and his family cultivated only 74 acres. This year, fertilizer was even more expensive. Still, they nearly doubled their planting and increased their use of fertilizer, divining that -- with other farmers retreating -- the white beans, corn and millet they grew would command a premium. They borrowed the money from a local seed company that provides technical advice along with fertilizer through a program forged by Mercy Corps, the international aid organization. The seed company waits for harvest until it collects its repayment. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Sambo's family proudly displayed its towering corn plants. One of his sons pulled back the silk on a promising ear to reveal plump white kernels. The family plans to fold its profits into expanding its acreage next year, eventually installing solar cells to generate electricity. But those who cannot afford fertilizer are triply cursed. They lack adequate crops to feed their families. They have nothing to sell to raise cash. Yet they must buy food at wildly inflated prices. Adamu Ibrahim, 28, a father of four, had hoped to sell some of his corn to generate funds to advance a crucial project -- replacing the crumbling mud walls of his home. Poisonous snakes regularly slither through the holes, menacing his family. He has been adding sections of cinder block to bar their path. But this year, he could afford to apply only half the usual fertilizer. On a recent afternoon, his corn slumped under the tropical sun. From the look of things, he said, my crop is only going to be for consumption. Impossible Prices By the time the cultivation season began in May, the ingredients for fertilizer were again widely available around the globe. The fertilizer market has stabilized, Mximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, said by telephone from his office in Rome. I do not see that much of a problem at this point. But farmers in much of Africa were still consumed with problems. The price of everything was going up. Fertilizer was available, but many farmers could not afford it. The cost of staple foods like corn, rice and beans was multiplying. So was the cost of meat, because livestock is typically fed with the husks of grains. In Washington, the Fed had been raising interest rates. Investors were selling a variety of currencies in riskier nations like Nigeria and buying suddenly more rewarding assets bought and sold in dollars. Over the last year, the Nigerian naira has surrendered nearly half its value against the dollar. The fall in local currencies increases the cost of all imports, including ingredients to make fertilizer. Fertilizer prices were far from the only source of distress for farmers. Catastrophic floods last year wiped out crops in northeastern Nigeria. In Abuja, the capital, the government eliminated subsidies for fuel this year, increasing transportation costs. And the inability to afford fertilizer makes it harder for rural families to overcome such challenges. Last year, Aisha Hassan Jauro, 40, a mother of five in the city of Yola, borrowed 100,000 naira (about 126) from a local bank at a 20 percent rate of interest. She used the money to buy fertilizer, seeds and pesticides while planting corn on her five acres. The floods destroyed her crop, leaving her with neither food nor cash, but still facing monthly loan payments of 17,500 naira (about 22). She and her husband buy spices and grains at a downtown market and sell them at higher prices in their village, earning enough for a single meal per day. They reserve their most nutritious food for the children -- fried dough made from cassava flour -- while the grown-ups subsist on boiled weeds pulled from their courtyard. They took their daughter out of university, where she was studying disaster management. Another daughter cannot begin seventh grade because they lack the 2,500 naira fee (about 3) for a required test. The land beckons as a potential source of recovery. But this year, with fertilizer even more expensive, they planted nothing. The Final Days For farmers accustomed to feeding their families, a trip to the market has become an indignity. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chubado arrived at the central market in Yola to supplement his meager harvest. He entered a labyrinth of muddy lanes choked with merchants. Boys wheeled wooden carts bearing eggs past women carrying baskets of plantains on their heads. Men stood over wooden tables, wielding knives to hack goats into fresh cuts of meat. The air was thick with the pungent smell of smoked fish, animal innards and diesel fuel, which powered clattering machines grinding corn into flour. Mr. Chubado bought spinach, a purple onion and a bottle of peanut oil for cooking. The oil was double the price of a year earlier, so he bought half his usual amount. He entered a stall where a man used a metal bowl to scoop urea from a large sack into two plastic shopping bags. I used to be able to buy a whole bag, Mr. Chubado said sheepishly. In Gombe, Juliana Bala has become acquainted with a sensation previously unknown in her 70 years -- fear of hunger. She raised six children in a house provided by her husband's employer, a local railroad. Neighbors traditionally shared meals with one another. But on a recent morning, Ms. Bala endured the hourlong trek to her farm, down a muddy, rutted trail, and was horrified to see that her crop had been defiled. Thieves had stolen half her corn. I broke down and cried, she said. How can someone apply their hard work and energy and then they take your harvest? Nearly half her annual income was gone, threatening not only her ability to feed herself, her husband and the six grandchildren they are raising, but depriving them of the savings they needed to buy seeds and fertilizer the next year. They no longer eat meat or fish, subsisting on porridge made from yam and beans. Crop theft was a new affliction. Ms. Bala took it as a sign -- that there were enough hungry people to stray into criminality; that the warnings she had absorbed from her Lutheran preacher were coming to pass. The final days were approaching, this the preacher had intoned for years. The pandemic was the first sign. The shortages of fertilizer and food -- spurred by a war -- seemed like the next one. And now, with half her crop disappeared, she could no longer feed the children. Life has changed, Ms. Bala said. I am scared that this is the end of the world.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Russia's war on Ukraine disrupted shipments of key ingredients for fertilizer.

The Federal Railroad Administration did not respond directly to the criticism of the rule requiring cameras showing both the train crew's actions and a view from the front of passenger trains. FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said freight railroads were not addressed because a 2015 law Congress passed only required regulators to establish a rule for passenger railroads. But many freight railroads, including all the biggest ones that handle a majority of shipments nationwide, have installed cameras voluntarily, starting with outward-facing cameras and later adding ones showing the crews' actions. The cameras are less common on smaller railroads. A spokeswoman for the American Short Line and Railroad Association said only a few short-line railroads have them and most of those are only outward-facing cameras. The Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February did have cameras, but Ms. Homendy said that because there are no federal standards for those cameras, investigators have only 20 minutes of footage from before that derailment. Though many in the freight rail industry have opted to install recorders voluntarily, there is absolutely no standard for the number of hours of data they must preserve after an accident, Ms. Homendy said. East Palestine is a striking example: instead of having 12 hours' worth of in cab video, as we have recommended, our investigators only have access to a 20-minute recording -- not nearly enough to help us or the FRA identify critical safety improvements needed to prevent similar accidents from reoccurring. Ms. Homendy said the new rule also fails to require audio recordings inside the cabs of locomotives. Investigators determined that the Metrolink engineer was sending and receiving text messages on his cell phone before the crash, and he ran a red signal light before slamming into the Union Pacific freight train. Congress responded to that Chatsworth collision by requiring railroads to develop and install an automatic braking system that might have prevented it -- something that took more than a decade and roughly 15 billion to complete. And regulators banned cell phone use by train operators. Later, lawmakers also required regulators in the 2015 law to look at requiring locomotive video recorders for passenger trains. Amtrak pledged in 2015 to install cameras on its trains after a crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured about 200. This new rule will require cameras on all intercity commuter and passenger trains as well. While video recorders cannot directly prevent accidents, they help maintain a higher standard of safety, said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. In addition, these devices play a vital role in post-accident investigations, providing valuable evidence that helps us understand the circumstances leading to the accident and take appropriate action to prevent similar accidents in the future.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Passenger railroads nationwide will now be required to install video recorders inside their locomotives.

Benjamin Okezie Kalu says the South East geo-political zone losses over N13 billion due to disruption in the movement of goods between the north and the southern part of the country. This is as the Deputy Speaker unveiled the mechanism as Peace In The South East (PISE) project aimed at restoring normalcy in the zone. Relying on available statistics, Kalu said that the south East looses an estimated N10 billion to N13 billion in the transportation sector alone on every sit-at-home day. The Deputy Speaker made the submissions during a courtesy call on him by the Nigerian Association Of Small And Medium Enterprises (NASMEs) led by its President, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima in his office on Friday in Abuja. Kalu said that insecurity in the region was affecting the small and medium enterprises which he recognized as a major contributor to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He however assured the commitment of the House to review the laws that are inhibiting the operations of the SMEs in the country. He said: According to recent data, SMEs account for 48 of the National GDP in emerging economies, additionally the World Bank report SMEs play pivotal role in job creation. Therefore, up scaling entrepreneurship because its strategic imperative to revitalizing the Nigerian economy. SMEs must be seen as a strategic tool to our economic development. As legislators, we are aware of security problems facing our nation. In recent years, the security situation has posed hurdles. The sit -at-home in the South East has affected the movement of goods between the north and the south. It ought not to be so. Why this issue affects the entire nation. We can examine specific examples. Our businesses are going down and most of our businesses are SME businesses and the security challenges are suffocating the SMEs businesses in their numbers. Also billions and trillions of Naira are being lost to the sit at home order. There are other parts of the country where insecurity has suffocated SMEs and something must be done about this. It is disheartening to note that the ongoing insecurity in the region will have a profound impact to trade and socioeconomic outcomes. Statistics from SBM Intelligence revealed that the south East looses an estimated ten billion naira to 13 billion in the transportation sector alone, every sit at home day. Traders on the other hand face looses ranging from N5.4 billion to N31 billion daily. These figures are alarming and underscore the urgency of addressing the security challenges in the region. So if there is no reason for these non state actors to stop this, let this be their reason. That they are killing their own region with insecurities created by themselves. When you sit at home other regions are not sitting at home. When the SMEs in the south east suffer due to insecurity, the country suffers. It impacts the whole country. There must be legislative commitment in order to address some of your concerns. The SMEs are the backbone of every country. As legislators, we are committed to supporting and making laws to grow SMEs. My office is ready to partner with the association, we will find ways to review existing laws that will be not SMEs friendly. We believe that by creating more enabling environment for SMEs to thrive, we can address some of the economic challenges facing our great nation. Earlier in his presentation, the President of the Nigerian Association Of Small And Medium Enterprises (NASME) led by its President, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima appealed to the Deputy Speaker to help the body enact laws that will support the growth of SMEs in the country. On unveiling the PISE project, he said that that soon his office in agreement with all the lawmakers from the region irrespective of the political parties will reach out the State governors and other critical stakeholders for the launch and implementation of the project. He also said that the project will feature a regional security integration and political leadership that will streamline an agenda for the promotion of Igbo because and growth in terms of infrastructure. Kalu who made the revelations during a courtesy call on him by the national leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex socio-cultural group led by its President General, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu bemoaned the insecurity in the south east. He added that the sit-at-home observed in the region every Monday has crippled businesses and left the region empty. Kalu who vehemently objected to the sit-at-home order stated that Ndigbo must extend their handshakes across the federation to restore confidence. The Deputy Speaker also commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his benevolence to Ndigbo by ensuring that the people of the south east were accorded a place in the political hierarchy of the country. Kalu also remarked of his cordial relationship with the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, saying he will be delighted in accommodating the requests of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in stamping out insecurity in the south east. He said: Let me also state that, in our pursuit for these noble objectives, it is imperative that we draw a clear distinction between a legitimate call for justice, equity and fairness against criminal activities. There is a difference between the two of them. Criminal activities cannot be taken to mean legitimate call. Secession is not a legitimate call. We want to remain as one Nigeria! It is a distinction that our people must be able to make. And together we must ensure that the line is firmly drawn. Igbo Community has always been in the forefront of nation building and positive change. Go to any part of Nigeria, if you do not see an Igbo man there, it means that place is not progressing, it means that place is not prosperous. We are everywhere, nobody is as patriotic as the Igbo man. I am here today, not just as the representative of the people of Bende, but as a representative of all Nigerians. The House of Representatives is actually named the House of the People for a reason. The 10th House of Representatives led by my Principal, Rt. Hon. Tajudeen Abbas, who is currently in India and who has sent his greetings and who would love to host you when he is back, as we arrange your next visit, the Honourable Speaker himself will be here. And I want to say that I have a good working relationship with the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I want to report to you as the father of Igbo land that, I have a good relationship between me and this North Westerner, who is the Speaker. He does not discriminate, he does not undermine me, he sees the potentials and we are working together like twins to help Nigeria in the House of Representatives. With him, we will ensure that there is justice, with him, we will ensure that there is fairness, with him, we will ensure that there is equity to all, including the Igbos. We are not known for self destruction that is evident in the idea of sit-at-home or unknown gun men. It is not our thing. It is alien to us. We do not kill one another. We love our trade, we love our farms. We do not sit at home. Sitting at home is for lazy people. Igbo people are not lazy people. Those in support of sit-at-home are not Igbos. There is no true son of the soil of Igbo land that would support laziness and call it a strategy for secession. If you sit at home, you are a lazy man. Igbos are not known to be lazy. We are industrious, we are entrepreneurs, we work hard to succeed. The tradition of collective action and communalism has been a hallmark of the Igbo people throughout history, from building schools and hospitals to markets and farms. We are not known for self-destruction that is evident in the idea of sit-at-home or unknown gunmen. These tendencies are alien and abhorrent to how the Igbos are constituted; socially, culturally, and economically. In addressing our present challenges, we have the opportunity to draw on the things that pull us together. We may have different political platforms, but we must realize that the commonwealth and common good are ultimately the same. Onye aghana nwanne ya, he said. Earlier in his presentation, the President-General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu called for the release of the leader of defunct Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, saying it will help restore peace in the South East. Ohaneze has decided that we want Nnamdi Kanu released. We think that every effort should be made to release Nnamdi Kanu. If he is released, it is going to make it easy for us, he said.

Russia's Black Sea Fleet capabilities remain largely intact, the update said, but the possible risk of military losses and the dire political consequences of Russia attacking merchant shipping would highly likely outweigh any gain from a blockade on Ukrainian bound trade. The White House on Friday accused North Korea of shipping weapons to Russia, near the Ukraine border. Its claims are based on an image released Friday showing a shipment from an ammunition depot in North Korea, or DPRK, that was loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being moved by rail to a depot along Russia's southwestern border. The delivery took place between Sept. 7 and October 1, the YOU.S. says. 'We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilian and further Russia's illegitimate war,' National Security Council Director of Strategic Communications John Kirby said Friday. This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows increased activity at the Tumangang Rail Facility in North Korea on October 5, 2023. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) Kirby has disclosed that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions. He said that the YOU.S. believes Kim Jong Un is seeking sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for the munitions - to boost North Korea's military and nuclear program. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines regional stability and the global nonproliferation regime, Kirby warned. He noted that Washington is in lockstep with allies and partners to counter arms deals between Russia and North Korea by sanctioning individuals and entities working to facilitate such arms deals. We will not allow the DPRK to aid Russia's war machine in secret, and the world should know about the support that Russia may again provide the DPRK in return, Kirby said. North Korea on Friday lambasted the arrival of a YOU.S. aircraft carrier battle group in South Korea, calling it an undisguised military provocation and proof that the YOU.S. plans an attack against it. North Korea threatened to respond in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The YOU.S. has accused North Korea of previously providing ammunition, artillery shells and rockets to Russia. North Korea has previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow. Targeting Odesa Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, during a visit to the Black Sea port of Odesa, pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defenses and to increase the security of a 'humanitarian corridor' for grain exports. Zelenskyy said Kyiv was working to strengthen its position in the Black Sea so that it can continue grain exports, which are a vital source of revenue for Ukraine's defense spending following Russia's invasion last year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, and Netherland's caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte pose for a photo with a wounded Ukrainian soldier in a hospital in Odesa, Ukraine, on October 13, 2023. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) 'We are working with partners to protect properly these corridors, and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea, and it also applies to the protection of Odesa's skies and in the region as a whole,' Zelenskyy said. The Odesa region has become a frequent target of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia has hit six civilian ships, 150 port and grain facilities and destroyed upwards of 300,000 tons of grain since Moscow quit a deal allowing safe Black Sea exports of Ukrainian grain, the Kyiv government said on Friday. In a statement, it said 21 vessels already had been loaded with grain for exports and used a new 'humanitarian' grain corridor in the Black Sea announced by Kyiv in August. It said a total of 25 ships had entered Ukrainian ports for loading. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian airstrikes during the winter, Rutte said Friday. 'This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So, the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric airstrikes,' Rutte said in Odesa. Rutte also said the Netherlands would help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Funding the effort European Union leaders meeting later in October will demand 'decisive progress' on using Russian assets frozen by sanctions to help Ukraine, according to their draft statement, addressing a matter that has been stuck for months. The United States and Britain last month showed support for an EU plan to tax windfall profits generated by frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine as Kyiv battles a full-scale Russian invasion begun in February 2022. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven, or G7, industrialized countries meeting in Morocco on Thursday estimated 280 billion worth of such assets had been frozen. They said they expected more work in the coming months to find legally sound ways of using them to aid Ukraine. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak joins other political leaders to view military equipment that has been given to Ukraine before they attend the Joint Expeditionary Summit on the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden. (Stefan RousseauPool via Reuters) Belgium, not a member of the G7 group, where most frozen Russian central bank assets are held, said it expects to collect 2.4 billion in taxes on the assets and use them to help Ukraine's reconstruction process, a spokesperson for Belgium's prime minister said Wednesday. Britain is planning to increase its military presence in northern Europe, including deploying 20,000 troops to the region next year, to help protect critical infrastructure at a time of growing concern over Russian sabotage. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Friday met fellow leaders as part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, or JEF, defense cooperation summit on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. JEF, a defense cooperation group between the Nordic and Baltic states, the Netherlands and Britain, was meeting days after a pipeline and a data cable in the Gulf of Finland were damaged due to 'outside activity,' stoking concerns about security in the wider Nordic region. 'This week, we have seen yet again that our security cannot be taken for granted. It is vital that we stand united against those with malign intent,' Sunak said in a statement.

Washington published pictures tracking a set of containers as it traveled from Najin, North Korea, to Dunay, Russia, by a Russian-flagged vessel. The supplies were then reportedly moved by rail to an ammunition depot in southwestern Russia near Tikhoretsk, roughly 200 kilometers from Ukraine's state border. We condemn (North Korea) for providing the Russians with this military equipment, YOU.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. The weapons would be used to attack Ukrainian cities and kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, Kirby added. While the news of an armaments delivery from North Korea to Russia was unsettling, it was not unexpected. Read also: Can Russia afford to commit to a years-long war? North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un arrived in Russia for a six-day tour of the country's far east last month, visiting an aircraft plant, inspecting the Admiral Shaposhnikov frigate, and meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Experts suggested that Moscow could furnish North Korea with the technology they needed for its struggling spy satellite program in return for Pyongyang's stockpile of Soviet-era weaponry - primarily artillery shells that could be used by Russian guns in Ukraine. The news of military cooperation confirms that we have entered a new era of Russia-North Korea relations. But it also poses a new question: What happens next for Moscow, Pyongyang, and the silent Beijing? Russia and North Korea have a longstanding relationship despite Pyongyang's zealous isolationism. In 2000, the two countries signed a treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation, and Moscow is one of just a handful of countries to maintain an embassy in Pyongyang. There have been multiple reports of North Korean hackers working from Russian territory, and North Korean laborers working in industries such as logging. But Russia and North Korea's relationship is not as simple or straightforward. Moscow has also supported numerous UN resolutions imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, including in 2010, 2013, and 2017. President Putin told reporters after Kim Jong-Un's visit that Moscow would uphold these sanctions, despite earlier remarks from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the resolutions had been made during a completely different geopolitical situation. Rather than an ongoing commitment, the latest chapter is more likely to consist of both sides exploiting global events to further their own ends. Moscow is looking not only for ammunition but also support for its aggression in Ukraine. North Korea is one of only a handful of countries to recognize Russian illegal territorial gains and consistently vote against UN resolutions supporting Ukraine. For now, the situation is still purely based on the idea that we will give you something, and we want something in exchange. There is no ideological cooperation, says Natalia Matiaszczyk, an expert at the Polish think tank Institute of New Europe. Support from North Korea is something Russia uses to legitimize its illegal actions on Ukraine territory. In many ways, this is as important as receiving the weapons themselves -- particularly as North Korea's ammunition stockpile is believed to be not only outdated but also of low quality. It is by no means certain that such ammunition could make a significant difference on the front line. But many outsiders underestimate North Korea's own agency. Pyongyang is also seizing a new diplomatic space that has opened up as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, says Yong-Chool Ha, director of the Center for Korea Studies at the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington. North Koreans have been suffering from the severe impact of the sanctions that have been imposed upon them, he says. But this is a new sort of opportunity and the evolution of a new diplomatic horizon, and we can see that in North Korea's behavior toward Russia. Read also: Kyiv, Moscow's opposing attitudes toward Soviet past shape two different futures And while the invasion of Ukraine has given North Korea new opportunities, it does not mean that it is an issue that holds a particular imperative for Pyongyang. For North Korea, Kim Jong-Un's visit to Russia was more of a signal of the country's re-opening after Covid 19 than of the country's stance in European affairs. After more than three years of closed borders due to Covid, North Korea is now opening back up slightly. North Koreans who were based abroad are now being allowed to come back, there has been news that soon, even foreigners will be allowed to visit. This is a huge change in domestic policy, says Tereza Novotna, a Korea-Europe Center Fellow at the Free University Berlin. Novotna points out that it was not just military facilities that featured in Kim Jong-Un's Russian itinerary. Kim Jong-Un also visited both an aquarium (where the North Korean leader was applauded by a walrus) and the ballet (although Russian news outlets reported he left after the first act). After the lockdown ended in Europe, we were so happy to finally go on vacation, says Novotna. Well, Kim Jong-Un's lockdown just ended now, and he went on vacation too. North Korea, however, is unlikely to provide Moscow with ammunition purely as thanks for a pleasant post-Covid trip. If Pyongyang shipped shells to Russia, what can it expect in return? Despite Putin's public remarks, it remains unclear whether the Kremlin could defy international sanctions and supply military technology to Pyongyang. In his October 13 press conference, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the YOU.S. believed Pyongyang wanted advanced Russian technologies for the North Korean military and nuclear program. Other experts believe that other types of technological exchange could be more likely. North Korea has recently been working on a satellite program but has so far faced two failed launches, says Matiaszczyk. Maybe that is what North Korea wants from Russia, a new technology that will help successfully send these satellites into orbit, she says. Real exchange between Moscow and Pyongyang is also likely to be hampered by the reaction of officials in Beijing. China is North Korea's largest trade partner, and Pyongyang relies heavily on Beijing's economic aid. Increased cooperation with Russia could be an attempt to reduce that dependency -- but China will not want its influence in the region to be diminished by the Kremlin and could make their displeasure known. Beijing currently also hopes to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and good relations with a number of other global powers, says Matiaszczyk. Russian tech deliveries to North Korea could endanger both of these goals. In the context of the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese authorities primarily seek to prevent escalation. That is why in the past, when North Korea pursued aggressive politics and nuclear testing, China supported the UN Security Council resolution against North Korea, says Matiaszczyk. Tightening cooperation between North Korea and Russia will also force the YOU.S., Japan, and South Korea to deepen their cooperation, including militarily, and that is something China really does not want. Read also: Even after sanctions, Russian economy can pay for war Then there is the question of the UN Security Council. If Russia violates UN sanctions, then the council will be forced to meet to discuss the situation. Although Moscow would be able to veto new sanctions, the scenario would still see Beijing in a difficult position. If Chinese officials voted in favor of a resolution, it would damage ties with Moscow. Still, if it were to abstain or vote against, China's international reputation and relationship with the West could be further damaged. China would be in a very awkward position, says Matiaszczyk. That is not to say that North Korea would be unhappy to see Beijing face such an uncomfortable diplomatic conundrum. In fact, Pyongyang has always been skilled at playing international powers off each other, says Novotna. North Korea could well try to exploit such a situation to gain maximum benefit from both Moscow and Beijing. I do not think there is ever been much love lost between North Korea and China. China has always been seen as a country that North Korea is dependent on -- and that there is no way to avoid that, she says. Yet, ultimately, it remains unlikely that Russia could replace China as a partner for North Korea. I do not think North Koreans would like to alienate China at this point, frankly. I do not think Russia could be a substitute for China either, says Ha. China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea's trade -- not Russia. Some commentators have raised the prospect that closer North Korean-Russia ties could pave the way for a new geopolitical power bloc comprising of Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang. But, most regional experts believe this risk is largely overstated. Rather than having a single outlook, each of these three countries has its own goals, needs, and relationships with each other. Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang also have their own separate relationships with other Asian countries. Rather than China, Russia, and North Korea rushing to form their own three-state bloc, a looser Eurasian alignment that involves other nations, such as certain Central Asian states, could be a more likely geopolitical outcome, says Ha. He believes that Kim Jong-Un is increasingly concerned about North Korea's place in southeast Asia, particularly after the Camp David summit in August when leaders from the YOU.S., South Korea, and Japan met to discuss greater military cooperation. The North Korean leader would later describe the alliance as the Asian version of NATO, the root because of war and aggression, and claimed the start of a new Cold War. I think Kim Jong-Un's perception of the emerging regional world and what is happening surrounding the Korean Peninsula was a factor in this meeting with Putin, says Ha. With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the strategic world map also changed dramatically. The Camp David summit was a clear indication of that drastic change in the security environment not only around the Korean Peninsula, but in East Asia in general. But this wider regional picture means that European nations should also try to engage in wider dialogue on North Korean-Russian issues. NATO should maintain close cooperation with allies like South Korea and Japan both in political, economic, and also military aspects, says Matiaszczyk, and should at least try to work with China. Europe also should not dismiss the idea of engaging with North Korea itself. I would advise the West not to see North Korea through the lens of Russia or Moscow's war on Ukraine, says Novotna. Now that North Korea is re-opening, it is a good moment to kind of restart European engagement with North Korea, and to think again about how to do it better than we did before, she says. It would be good to think about how to do this without putting Pyongyang into the same basket as Russia or Beijing and thinking of them as one entity because once we start doing this, that is what is actually going to happen, Novotna adds. We still have a chance for different policies.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The White House announced on October 13 that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition to Russia.

Another three companies are said to still be under investigation regarding their participation in the project, which began construction in 2015, opening to vehicular traffic in 2018 and rail in 2019. Spanning the Kerch Strait with a length of 19km (12 miles), the Crimean Bridge is the longest in Europe. It quickly exceeded the popularity of the ferry, which was formerly the only direct means of transport between mainland Russia and Crimea and has become an economic lifeline for the region after the US-backed coup of 2014 installed a new regime in Kiev. The US and EU have both imposed sanctions on dozens of companies and individuals involved in the construction of the Crimean Bridge, expanding the sanctions they initially deployed against Moscow over Crimea's 2014 referendum in favor of becoming part of Russia - a move the West and the government in Kiev refer to as an illegal annexation. Since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in 2022, Kiev has openly sought to destroy the bridge, which both countries view as a critically important strategic link and a symbol of Moscow's permanence in Crimea.

He and his neighbors cut the avocados with the owners permission and sell them to motorists at a nearby toll booth or on the streets of the nearby city of Valencia, which has not emptied out as much as San Joaquin from migration over the last decade. They live day by day. Their pension these days amounts to 3.70 a month, only 20 cents more than the cost of a gallon of bottled water. So no sales mean no food. Sometimes, we even have to barter avocados for food in other neighborhoods. We want jobs! Hernandez, 67, exclaimed while sitting on his dusty, cement-floor porch with a neighbor. He was a carrier, I sold merchandise downtown. Right now, there is no work. All the young people have already left. This neighborhood is desolate! The political, social and economic crisis that has come to define their South American homeland has evolved since it began a decade ago as a result of a global drop in the price of oil, Venezuela's most valuable resource, mismanagement by the self-proclaimed socialist administration and government repression of its opponents. The latest phase has been particularly challenging after the economic stability that many experienced for several months overlapping 2021 and 2022 vanished. They again are grappling with constant food-price hikes, business closures and painful thoughts of migrating. FILE - People shop at a street market in the Petare neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela, October 4, 2023. (AP PhotoMatias Delacroix, File) Amid this daily reality, Venezuelans are hearing election chatter as the opposition gets ready to hold a primary October 22 to pick a candidate to challenge President Nicols Maduro in a presidential election next year. But apathy and disgust toward politics and politicians - be they Maduro, his allies or his adversaries - have deepened among the young and old amid the litany of disappointments, corruption accusations, rampant misinformation and government repression. Maduros government managed to get Venezuela out of a hyperinflationary cycle at the end of 2021 with public spending cuts, tax increases and foreign currency injections. For a time last year, workers could pull out of their pockets a dollar or two and maybe even some worthless bolivares, the local currency. Practically everyone knew someone running a business from their home, such as selling sugar-free snacks via Instagram or offering group lessons on basic math. The respite - coming after Venezuela's economy contracted 80 from 2014 into 2021 - even prompted some Venezuelans to return from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and other Latin American countries that had hosted them for years but where they could not find work in a post-pandemic economy. It also slowed down the exodus from Venezuela. But by January, the stability was gone. May 1 came and went without the presidents traditional Labor Day announcement of a minimum wage increase. The last raise, in April 2022, put monthly pay at 130 bolivares, which at the time was worth 30, but has now dwindled to 3.70. These days, a kilo (2.2 pounds) of chicken costs about 2.40, a dozen eggs is 2.25, and a liter (a little over a quart) of milk goes for 2. Things got very difficult. Even getting sick is difficult because if you buy food, you cant buy medicine, Mayela Ramirez, 59, said standing by her front door in downtown Valencia, once home to multiple auto assembly plants. I have a nephew who has a problem with his brain - he has like a ball growing there - and needs a biopsy, but he cant (afford it) because it is 150, so we are doing raffles to raise money. Ramirez helps her husband run his auto repair shop, but it is no longer uncommon for a week to go by without a single car being dropped off. It has been a long time since she shopped freely at the grocery store, where she now buys more vegetables than ever because protein sources are too expensive. She has noticed people have begun leaving the country again, including four of her neighbors who migrated at the end of September. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled their country, mostly to Latin American and Caribbean countries. But these days, people are migrating with their eyes set on the YOU.S. and not Colombia or Peru, which have received the largest number of Venezuelans since the crisis began. Over the last year, the number of Venezuelan migrants trying to enter the YOU.S. through its southern border has increased exponentially. YOU.S. border patrol agents in the last 11 months had more than 199,500 encounters with Venezuelans at the YOU.S.-Mexico border, compared with 2,700 in all 2020. In August alone, the encounters were more than 31,400. Venezuelans have come to feel the crisis as one numbingly featureless expanse of struggles, though they use some of its bigger calamities to parse out one year from another: 2017 had mass anti-Maduro protests and repression; 2018 saw severe food shortages; 2019 brought nationwide power outages; 2020 had days-long gas station lines. Worries are growing as people see many of these woes striking all at once, even in the capital, Caracas, whose residents had been partially insulated from some of the crisis challenges. The variety of products at supermarket shelves and neighborhood markets is getting smaller. Imported-goods stores put goods on the front edge of shelves to give the appearance of being fully stocked. Restaurants are closing. Refilling a gas tank with subsidized fuel again involves careful planning. Hours-long power outages are more frequent in Caracas. Many long for the days of el Comandante - the late President Hugo Chvez and his self-described socialist revolution of the 2000s. But regardless of political affiliation, Venezuelans are increasingly feeling like pawns in a geopolitical game that ignores their empty wallets. A 12-hour stretch one recent day illustrated that growing sentiment. Around 9:30 a.m., the highway that goes by San Joaquin was blocked by soldiers purportedly for unsafe conditions due to downed electrical wires, but they moved aside roughly two hours later after local leaders verified that Maria Corina Machado, the frontrunner in the oppositions presidential primary, had left the area. By 4:30 p.m., the YOU.S. government, whose economic sanctions failed to topple Maduro, flipped-flopped on its definition of safety for Venezuelans when it announced the resumption of deportation flights to the South American country. The announcement came just two weeks after it had expanded protections for about 500,000 Venezuelan migrants citing increased instability and lack of safety in the country. Around 6 p.m., news of the flights spread on social media and thousands of people rallied with Machado in Valencia. An hour later, the attorney general announced on national television a new criminal investigation against Juan Guaid, an exiled opposition leader who ran a parallel government to Maduros with the help of the YOU.S. The government needs to be removed, but right now, right now, what is affecting us Venezuelans is the economy, said Vanessa Martinez, 31, who does maintenance at a rest stop for about 60 a month and was unaware of the oppositions primary. Here, one lives day to day, she said. The situation is very sad. Who knows when well see a change. FILE - Homes cover a hill in the Petare neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela, Monday, October 2, 2023.

Borrell, who is on a three-day China visit, also told a press conference he has asked Beijing to use its influence to make Russia go back to a grain deal initiative to allow the resumption of Ukraine grain exports via the Black Sea. Otherwise, we will face another food crisis, he said, noting the war has sent shock waves around the world. Moscow has pulled out of the grain deal mediated by Turkey and the United Nations. 11:30 a.m. Russian forces pounded the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka for the fourth day in a row on Friday. In Avdiivka, known for its large coking plant in Ukraine's Donbas industrial heartland, officials said the Russian assaults had left the already-gutted city in flames. The fighting has been going on for four consecutive days, Vitaliy Barabash, head of the city's military administration, told Ukrainian national television. They have substantial reserves of personnel and equipment. Avdiivka is completely ablaze. They shoot, using everything they have. The hospital is again under fire, as are administrative buildings and our volunteer center. 12:30 a.m. The Netherlands will deliver more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine, Prime Minister Mark Rutte says, according to Reuters. This winter, Russia will try to hurt Ukraine as much as possible. So the Netherlands will supply extra Patriot missiles, so that Ukraine can defend itself against Russia's barbaric air strikes, Rutte says following a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Odessa, Ukraine. Rutte says the Netherlands would also help Ukraine acquire patrol boats to help keep the shipping route for grain exports safe. Friday, October 13 11:10 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says on the key topic of his upcoming visit to China would be the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing's plan for global infrastructure and energy networks it launched a decade ago. Putin said he would also discuss settlements in national currencies with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing next week. Thursday, October 12 10:48 p.m. The International Olympic Committee's executive board says it has suspended the Russian Olympic Committee with immediate effect for including regional sports organizations in Ukraine as ROC members, since this violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine's National Olympic Committee. The ROC had recognized Olympic Councils from the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia -- parts of Ukraine that Russia has unilaterally declared as part of itself. The ROC is no longer entitled to operate as a National Olympic Committee ... and cannot receive any funding from the Olympic Movement, said the IOC, which reserves the right to decide about the participation of individual neutral athletes with a Russian passport in the Olympic Games Paris 2024 and the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 at the appropriate time. Russia remains excluded from international events in team sports, The Associated Press reports. 5:30 p.m. The Czech Republic and Denmark will jointly supply heavy military equipment to Ukraine in the coming months, the Czech Defense Ministry says. The Czech-made supplies, financed from the Danish budget, would include tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, handguns and ammunition. 4:28 p.m. The Russian ruble leaped more than 3 on Thursday to a more than two-week high past 96 to the dollar after President Vladimir Putin ordered the mandatory sale of foreign currency revenues for some exporters to buttress the Russian currency. The ruble collapsed to a record low in the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, after which authorities imposed similar capital controls that saw the rouble recover to a seven-year high. But it has charted a steadily downward course this year, under pressure from capital outflows, falling exports and recovering imports. 3:48 p.m. Russia and India are in discussions about a summit between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year, India's ambassador to Moscow was quoted by Russian news agency RIA as saying. It is being discussed. There are high-level discussions going on, Ambassador Pavan Kapoor said. 1:25 a.m. The YOU.S. says it will send up to 200 million in military supplies to Ukraine in its latest package of support. The package includes additional air defense capabilities, anti-tank weapons, additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other equipment, according to a statement from the Pentagon. 12:02 a.m. Ukraine received a 1.15 billion grant from the YOU.S. as part of the PEACE in Ukraine program, reports Reuters, citing the Ukrainian Finance Ministry. The PEACE (Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance) in Ukraine project has been the World Bank's flagship financing instrument for Kyiv during the war. Wednesday, October 11 11:55 p.m. Denmark, the Netherlands and the YOU.S. will spearhead a new international coalition to help Ukraine establish a future air force based on F-16 fighter jets, the Danish Defense Ministry said, according to Reuters. The new coalition intends to build infrastructure around F-16s, including maintenance facilities to support the operation of the planes, the ministry said in a statement. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first two countries to commit to donating F-16 jets to Ukraine, which currently has an air force fleet of aging Soviet-era fighter jets. 6:00 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked NATO allies on Wednesday for more weapons and air defense systems to tide his country over another wartime winter as it braces for a further barrage of Russian attacks on power stations and infrastructure. Zelenskyy was making his first visit to NATO headquarters since Russia's invasion last year, at a time when turbulence in the YOU.S. Congress threatens to disrupt aid for Kyiv and world attention is being drawn to the crisis unfolding in Israel. 2:30 p.m. China will host its third Belt and Road Forum next week, its foreign ministry says, a signature event for President Xi Jinping that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is due to attend on a rare trip abroad. The Beijing conference on October 17-18 marks the 10th anniversary of the Xi-championed Belt and Road Initiative. Representatives from many developing countries, notably from Latin America and Africa, are expected to attend. Putin attended the two previous forums, in 2017 and 2019, and the Kremlin said in September he had accepted an invitation to next week's gathering and for talks with Xi. 7:30 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the recent violence between Israel and the Palestinians showed that YOU.S. policy had failed in the Middle East and had ignored the needs of Palestinians. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin was in touch with both sides and would seek a role in resolving the conflict. Peskov warned that the conflict risked spilling over into other regions. During talks with visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, Putin blamed the escalation on years of YOU.S. policy. I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East, he said. 1:13 a.m. Germany announces new support for Ukraine, with a roughly 1 billion euro (1.06 billion) air defense package and a more than 20 million euro package of vehicles, weapons and personal equipment. The air defense package includes the Patriot and IRIS-T systems. Germany is thus further increasing the operational readiness of the Ukrainian armed forces in the coming months, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius says. 1:00 a.m. Russia fails in its bid to return to the United Nations' top human rights body. In a secret ballot, Russia won 83 votes versus 160 for Bulgaria and 123 for Albania, which had competed against it in the same eastern Europe grouping for two seats on the Geneva-based Human Rights Council for a three-year term beginning on January 1. Tuesday, October 10 11:01 p.m. A subsea gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia under the Baltic Sea have been damaged in what may have been a deliberate act, the Finnish government says, according to Reuters. The Balticconnector gas pipeline was shut early on Sunday on concerns that gas was leaking from a hole in the 77-kilometer pipeline. Finnish operator Gasgrid said it could take months or more to repair. 10:07 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he had good news on artillery and air defense supplies after talks with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in Bucharest, but gave no details, reports Reuters. My main accent today was air defense. And I am glad that Ukraine was heard by the Romanian side, Zelenskyy, who has been seeking more arms to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion, tells a joint press conference in the Romanian capital. 3:20 p.m. Russia launched 36 Iranian-made attack drones against southern Ukraine overnight, damaging infrastructure in the Odesa region, authorities say. The strikes targeted the Odesa, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian military reported, adding that air defense systems destroyed 27 drones. Odesa's governor, Oleh Kiper, said unspecified logistics infrastructure had been struck but that no injuries were reported. 10:00 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to hold talks in the Kremlin on Tuesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani on bilateral issues and the developing situation in the Middle East. Issues of developing multifaceted Russian-Iraqi cooperation, as well as current topics on the international agenda, primarily the situation in the Middle East, will be discussed in detail, the Kremlin said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. 7:00 a.m. Top United Nations trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russian officials in Moscow on Monday for talks aimed at enabling unimpeded access to global markets for grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine, a YOU.N. spokesperson said. YOU.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths attended the meetings virtually, YOU.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. YOU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues in his determination to facilitate the unimpeded access to global markets for food products and fertilizers from both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, Dujarric added. 2:10 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says on Monday that it was in Russia's interests to stoke war in the Middle East to weaken global unity. Based on available information -- very clear information -- it is in Russia's interests to inflame war in the Middle East to create a new source of pain and suffering that would weaken global unity, create divisions and help Russia in undermining freedom in Europe, Zelenskyy says in his nightly video address. Zelenskyy says Russians propagandists were gloating at developments and that Iran, which he described as Moscow's ally, was openly supporting those attacking Israel. In a call on Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Zelenskyy says Ukraine was in solidarity with Israel, which is enduring a brazen, large-scale attack. Sunday, October 8 5:35 a.m. Russia's Defence Ministry says the country's air defense systems detected and destroyed two Ukrainian S-200 anti-aircraft missiles, thwarting attacks it says Kyiv attempted four hours apart on the Crimean Peninsula. 4:00 a.m. Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia's Chechnya region and close ally of President Vladimir Putin, says a presidential election due next March should either be postponed due to the war in Ukraine or limited to one candidate, Putin. The Kremlin leader has said he will not announce if he will run before parliament calls the election, which by law it is due to do in December. I propose now, while the 'special military operation' is under way, to unanimously decide that we will have one candidate in the elections -- Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, Kadyrov was quoted as saying by the state-run RIA news agency at a rally in the Chechen capital Grozny to mark Putin's October 7 birthday that was attended by thousands. 3:15 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin announces the start of gas supplies to Uzbekistan via Kazakhstan in a meeting with his counterparts from the two countries in Moscow. This is the largest trilateral energy project among the three ex-Soviet countries, Putin said, after formally launching the shipment. Under a two-year deal signed with Russia's Gazprom, Uzbekistan will import 9 million cubic meters of Russian natural gas per day. 12:15 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemns what he called a terrorist attack on Israel after a surprise assault by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and backed the country's right to self-defense. Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world, he wrote on the social media platform X. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment. Saturday, October 7 9:30 p.m. Rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border rose sharply this week to the highest in years, suggesting arms supply by Pyongyang to Moscow after their leaders discussed deeper military cooperation, a YOU.S. think tank says. Satellite imagery showed an unprecedented 73 or so freight cars at Tumangang Rail Station in the North Korean border city of Rason, the Beyond Parallel Project of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report. The traffic was far greater than that observed in the past five years, including pre-pandemic levels, it says. 6:00 a.m. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's envoy to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, says Moscow will revoke its ratification of the pact, a move that Washington denounced as endangering the global norm against nuclear test blasts. Ulyanov said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Russia plans to revoke ratification (which took place in 2000) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The aim is to be on equal footing with the US who signed the Treaty, but did not ratify it. Revocation does not mean the intention to resume nuclear tests. 1:30 a.m. The YOU.S. Commerce Department has added 42 Chinese companies to a government export control list over support for Moscow's military and defense industrial base, including supplying the Russian sector YOU.S.-origin integrated circuits. Another seven entities from Finland, Germany, India, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom were also added to the trade export control list. The circuits include microelectronics that Russia uses for precision guidance systems in missiles and drones launched against civilian targets in Ukraine, the Commerce Department said in a statement. Today's additions to the Entity List provide a clear message: if you supply the Russian defense sector with YOU.S.-origin technology, we will find out, and we will take action, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said in the statement.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"EU foreign policy chief urges China not to support Russia in its war against Ukraine.

A day after murderous terrorists invaded Israel, critical infrastructure connecting frontline NATO allies was shut down as a result of external activity -- possibly foreign sabotage -- according to Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. Russia sympathizes with us, senior Hamas official Ali Baraka said in a Sunday interview on the government-controlled Russia Today TV. One war eases the pressure in another war. While Finnish and Estonian officials are still investigating the disruption of a pipeline and communication cable, the timing is likely no coincidence. If it resulted from foreign action, then the foreign agents took advantage of the fact that world attention was focused elsewhere to carry out an operation they had likely already planned. Did Russia have prior knowledge of Hamas's invasion plan? Russia has long weaponized its monopolistic position as Europe's oil supplier to extract political concessions from dependent neighbors by cutting off energy supplies. The Balticonnector Pipeline began operations in 2020, connecting Finland to the rest of Europe via Estonia and reducing Russia's oil leverage over both countries. Russia would clearly benefit from disabling the pipeline. Both countries are pro-western states on Russia's border and view the USSR's primary successor state as their greatest threat. In April, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Finland officially joined the anti-Russian NATO alliance, which Estonia joined in 2004. Yet, according to Baraka's interview in a Russian propaganda outlet, Russia was notified prior to the assault. In order to keep the attack secret and successful, the different factions and our allies did not know the zero hour, he said. But Hamas did update Russia after they inquired about the Hamas attack and its intention. If Russia is responsible for the Balticonnector sabotage, they implemented the plan opportunistically. Russia was not the only ally Hamas informed of its plans on Saturday. After half an hour of commencing the attack, all the Palestinian resistance factions were contacted, as were our allies in Hezbollah and Iran, said Baraka. He added that they even notified Turkey -- an increasingly rogue member of NATO -- and met with them only three hours into the operation. Our allies are those that support us with weapons and money, explained Baraka. First and foremost, it is Iran that is giving us money and weapons. For years, Western intelligence officials have known that Iran was providing military training and logistical help. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said last year that Iran had provided the group with 70 million in military assistance. On Thursday, the YOU.S. government and Qatar agreed to block Iran from accessing 6 billion in funds the YOU.S. had unfrozen as an appeasement measure. Baraka also pointed to Hamas's close affinity with Hezbollah, another radical Islamic terror organization funded by Iran, but which is based in Lebanon instead of Gaza. Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel on Tuesday, in an effort to divide Israel's forces and limit the safe places where refugees from southern Israel could be temporarily relocated. Baraka also boasted that the Arab and Islamic people ... are standing by us. Even if he presumes too much when speaking for all people who identify as Muslims, these are not idle words; on Sunday, Palestinian sympathizers staged demonstrations in support of Hamas' barbarous tactics across the West. Even Russia sympathizes with us, added Baraka. Russia is happy that America is getting embroiled in Palestine. It alleviates the pressure on the Russians in Ukraine. One war eases the pressure in another war. So, we are not alone on the battlefield. He said that Russia, a major exporter of weapons, even gave a Russian license to produce Kalashnikov bullets in Gaza, allowing Hamas to procure additional ammunition for Russian-made machine guns despite international sanctions. That is quite the international coalition supporting a terror group, but it features the usual suspects. Nations like Iran and Russia are not friendly toward the YOU.S. and would jump at any opportunity to knock the YOU.S. down a peg. Consequently, Hamas' attack did not happen in isolation. We have been preparing for this for two years, Baraka said. In other words, Hamas began preparing to launch a major assault against Israel in the immediate aftermath of America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some unconfirmed reports have even suggested that Hamas used weapons YOU.S. forces left behind in Afghanistan, which evidently made their way across the Middle East through illicit arms trading. When America's foes see us as weak, they calculate that it is time to strike. The same actors -- and even more of them -- are aligned on Russia's side of the conflict in Ukraine. After Ukraine stalled Russia's first assault and ground down its war machine with Western aid, Russia turned to other bad actors to restock its supplies. There have been reports that Iran, China, Cuba, North Korea, and even South Africa are supplying Moscow with military equipment and personnel. In October 2022, the Pentagon said they knew that Russia was using Iranian drones in Ukraine, and they believed Iranians were on-site to help the Russians operate them. In February, the Biden administration considered releasing intelligence that showed China was supplying arms to Russia. Customs records obtained by Politico this summer show that China has shipped body armor and other military munitions to Russia. In May, the YOU.S. ambassador to South Africa accused the allegedly neutral country with supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, via a sanctioned cargo ship it allowed to dock at a naval base near Cape Town in December. In September, the White House said North Korea and Russia were actively advancing arms negotiations, and satellite photos last week detected a near-quadrupling in rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border. Even distant Cuba has gotten involved, smuggling hundreds of soldiers to fight in Russia's war. In addition to military assistance, American rivals on the world stage also cooperate economically. An organization of second-tier economic powers, known as BRICS (for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will more than double its membership in January 2024 when it officially admits Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the YOU.A.E. The organization, which includes some of the largest economies in Africa, Asia, and South America, is actively discussing ways to move international trade away from the YOU.S. dollar and towards other national currencies. BRICS expansion is significant because it indicates that even YOU.S. military allies, like India, or economic partners, like Saudi Arabia, are increasingly willing to cooperate with adversaries the YOU.S. has tried to isolate. Such interconnection in foreign policy is not a new development. Independent powers have combined into military coalitions since at least the time of Abraham (see Genesis 14:1-2). In the century between Napoleon and World War I (1814-1919), international politics particularly focused on the alliances between five to nine so-called great powers, which were ever-changing to maintain a precarious balance of power. This provoked a string of conflicts, culminating in two devastating world wars. After World War II, only two great powers remained (the YOU.S. and the Soviet Union), which spearheaded two worldwide coalitions (countries not aligned with either side were dubbed the third world). Due to the invention of nuclear weapons, the two great powers did not risk an all-out war, but they still struggled together in an economic Cold War and a series of proxy wars over influence in other countries -- Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua, Afghanistan. When the Soviet Union collapsed after four decades, the YOU.S. found itself in the rare position of a global hegemon -- a world power with no equal. The conflicts of this period -- two Iraq wars, Afghanistan, Serbia -- reflect America's ability to go anywhere in the world and do whatever we wanted, always dealing with asymmetric opponents. In the early 2000s, President Bush could call out by name an axis of evil, consisting of three countries, for the whole world to shun. But shifting alliances and changing power balances have changed the global situation once again. China's decades-long buildup and Russia's resurgence have placed the YOU.S. on the defensive in far-flung zones of influence. Part of this is from not recognizing the threat. America has largely let China's military buildup and global friend-buying projects go unanswered, and the YOU.S. has become consumed with internal divisions, which other nations may have played a role in aggravating. We stopped playing the game, while everyone else was playing harder than ever. Whatever the reason why a growing coalition of global adversaries is arrayed against America, a world in which the YOU.S. is not the all-dominant power is actually just a return to equilibrium, from a historical aberration. Most Americans today cannot remember anything different, but for most of history geopolitics has been a delicate balancing act, or very bloody. American ingenuity and freedoms can go a long way, at least with good leadership. But we cannot count on always being the unchallenged champion in an adversarial arena that incentivizes the rise of challengers -- especially when those challengers can combine together. The takeaway is that America cannot afford to view one hostile power or one national crisis in isolation. What is currently happening in Israel will affect the war in Ukraine, the security of Taiwan, and even the possibility of major terror strikes against American targets.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Hamas official: Russia sympathizes with us, senior Hamas official Ali Baraka said in a Sunday interview on the government-controlled Russia Today TV.

The center, which operates as an information outlet under the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in a Telegram post that supporters of Kyiv in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol sabotaged a Russian train that is used to bring daily supplies from Crimea to Melitopol and Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The result of the attack was an explosion that reportedly damaged a locomotive and 150 meters of railway. The incident is the latest in a series of attacks this year that have targeted Russian railways. Other high-profile rail sabotage acts include an explosion on a railway line in Crimea's Feodosia region in June and a May explosion that led to a derailment suspended rail traffic between Simferopol, Crimea's capital, and Sevastopol. According to the National Resistance Center of Ukraine, Friday's incident was the 10th successful sabotage on Russian railways carried out by partisans in the Zaporizhzhia region this year. Newsweek reached out to the National Resistance Center of Ukraine and the Russian Ministry of Defense via email for comment on Friday. The Ukrainian center said the train targeted on Friday not only brings supplies to Russian President Vladimir Putin's military personnel in Zaporizhzhia, but it also carries damaged equipment and stolen goods -- such as iron ore, grain and other property -- from Ukraine back to Crimea. The center's Telegram message said Russian troops surrounded the site of the attack after the explosion in an effort to conceal the sabotage took place while also searching for the guerrillas behind the attack. The National Resistance Center of Ukraine indicated the partisans behind the attack are safe and that they have promised to carry out more acts of sabotage in the future. Ukrainian partisans have been credited with key attacks throughout the war that Putin launched in February 2022. In August 2022, The Washington Post reported partisans were likely behind an attack on Russia's Saky air base in Crimea that triggered at least 12 explosions at the facility. Supporters of Ukraine within Russia also claimed responsibility for a wave of attacks in Russia's border regions, including several in Belgorod. In late-July, partisans were also said to be behind a mass poisoning during a Russian military celebration in the occupied city of Mariupol.

An estimated 42 of grizzly rail collisions occur in the valley despite accounting for only 0.6 of the province's population. A shot from a rifle. A trap. Poison. For decades, a grizzly bear's encounter with a humanity's footprint often meant death as settlers spread across North America. Grizzly range across the continent sits at less than half what it once used to be. And while conservation efforts have helped buoy some grizzly populations over the last several decades, some places remain more deadly than others. Over the last seven years, young grizzlies in British Columbia's Elk Valley have faced the lowest survival rate recorded in North America, according to a new study published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice. Lead author Clayton Lamb, a wildlife scientist with Biodiversity Pathways and researcher at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, said roughly half of the young male grizzlies in the area were dying every year -- a combination of human conflict and collisions with a train, truck or car. These bears are dying at extraordinary high rates, said Lamb. For any one year it is like a coin flip if you are going to live. Elk Valley grizzlies were involved in a third of all road collisions in the province despite only making up 0.6 per cent of the province's grizzly population. And when it comes to rail collisions, nearly half the recorded mortalities occur in the Elk Valley, the study found. As a result, the researchers estimated government mortality databases are underreporting grizzly deaths by 65 per cent -- meaning that for every dead grizzly, two go uncounted. A ripple effect The high death rate for young grizzlies has meant habitat in the Elk Valley is regularly opened up for more young bears to move in. Grizzlies from as far away as Banff National Park in Canada and Glacier National Park in the YOU.S. find a valley rich in both food and humans. Known for massive coal mines, the Elk Valley is laced with busy highways and rail connections that weave through towns as they link Canadian provinces east of the Rockies with ports on the coast. It is here where Lamb and his team of biologists -- one from the provincial government, others from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature based in Kaslo, B.C. -- set out to understand why grizzlies were dying at such high rates and what was keeping the their population afloat. To find out, the research team captured 76 grizzly bears between 2016 and 2022, monitoring their behaviour, reproduction and survival using radio collars. While the bears roamed an area stretching seven kilometres into Alberta, most of their territory occupied a swath of the Rocky Mountains east of Cranbrook that contains five large open pit coal mines, and the towns of Elkwood, Sparwood and Fernie. The region is also an active recreational area, popular among off-road vehicles users, hunters, fishers and mountain bikers. Over seven years, they tracked 14 grizzly bear deaths -- six due to human-wildlife conflict, six involved in collisions with a vehicle or train, one which died of natural causes, and another whose death was suspected to be connected to a human. Lamb recalls the gruesome task of tracking down the young grizzlies after their radio collars stopped moving. They would be hit, and then they could make it a few hundred metres and I would find them dead, said Lamb. You know that the driver obviously knew they hit something but that as soon as that bear gets off the highway, it essentially does not exist from a data perspective. The province does not know about it. It just dies in the bush and nobody knows. Local bear population overwhelmed by high death rate Whether in a rail or road collision, Lamb estimates as few as one in five dead bears gets recorded. For a population of roughly 100 grizzly bears, Lamb says it is generally accepted that a mortality rate of roughly five per cent, or five bears, is sustainable. Road and rail deaths alone pushes the death rate to six per cent. Then there are deaths due to conflict with humans, which regularly doubles that death rate, meaning that without in-migration, seven more bears are dying every year than the population can sustain. Grizzlies from elsewhere have moved in, filling the habitat left empty by those dead bears. But a population that relies on migration raises serious questions over its long-term survival. We are always wondering, how sustainable is this on our end? Lamb said. For example, if some of the wilder areas around the valley, if they all of a sudden get developed and we build a coal mine there or we build new towns in these places, and we kind of reduce the pool that we are pulling dispersers in from -- maybe this currently sustainable dynamic, maybe it all collapses. Relying on migration to replace a fast-dying bear population could be a problem beyond B.C.'s grizzly dense Elk Valley. The more Lamb and his colleagues count dead grizzlies in somebody is front yard or on the side of the road, the higher chance their deaths could lead to a ripple effect that impacts the demographics of bears up to 100 kilometres away in places we think of as protected national parks. As Lamb put it: It is just this wicked spiral that we are in. Coexistence still a long way off In recent decades, a move to protect grizzly populations has often focused on reducing human-bear conflicts, either by locking away attractants or reducing the number of bears killed by hunters. From Yellowstone to the southern Canadian Rockies, conservation programs have allowed grizzlies to reclaim some of their lost historic range, which today sits at 55 per cent of its historic total. But even as grizzly populations rebound, humans have continued to expand their settlements, setting up a test as to whether people and bears can coexist. ?For Lamb, Elk Valley might be the deadliest place for grizzlies in B.C. But that fact also makes it an easy candidate for conservation. By focusing attention and dollars in one small area of the province, he says governments and locals could remove between a third and half of all grizzly road and rail collisions in all of B.C. There is a lot of bang for their buck investing in conservation solutions here, Lamb said. Despite at least 40 years of progress in advancing the protection of B.C.'s grizzly populations, Lamb says many communities have yet to switch to a coexistence mindset fast enough and are still not set up to live alongside large carnivores. More support needed for electric fencing, fruit tree removal Part of the gap is financial. Unlike Alberta or Montana, the B.C. government does not have dedicated coexistence programs to reduce the availability of attractants, namely garbage, livestock and fruit trees. Lamb said B.C. lacks a cost-sharing program that helps ranchers with electric fencing. Other residents, he said, may be convinced to remove a fruit tree in their backyard if there was better financial support. Glacier Media reached out repeatedly to multiple ministries for comment but had not heard back more than 48 hours past its initial deadline. When it comes to roadway deaths, Lamb says there is already a project that aims to set up electric fencing -- a proven deterrent for grizzlies -- along 27 of the valley's 100 kilometres of highway. The project, which is not finished and not fully funded, includes dedicated wildlife road crossings in what Lamb describes as a positive move forward. Railway collisions? Almost no progress, he said of negotiations with CP Rail, which recently rebranded as CPKC after buying out Kansas City Southern Railway in 2021. We really struggle working with the rail company. CPKC spokesperson Terry Cunha said the company has engaged with the Canadian government and other institutions concerning rail-related wildlife strikes. Actions we have taken include focusing efforts on vegetation management along the tracks in key areas through the mountains to reduce wildlife activity close to the railway, support wildlife sightlines and ensure room for animals to safely exit the tracks, Cunha said in an email.

The extensive network is believed to be as much as 100ft (30m) beneath the surface in some places and makes up a central part of defences the terrorist group has spent years preparing. Tunnel entrances are hidden in the bottom floors of houses, mosques and schools, while the territory's narrow streets and alleyways are expected to have been laid with booby traps and homemade bombs in preparation for any Israeli attack. Hamas' preparations will mean any ground assault into northern Gaza will be fraught with danger and likely to cause heavy casualties on both sides, as well as the civilian residents who remain. The difficulties of clearing the defences will be increased by the potential use of human shields from the local population and even from among the scores of Israeli hostages seized at the weekend. Israeli officials have also alleged the group builds military bases near residential buildings and has also in the past hidden weapons in homes, or even schools and health facilities. Dr Daphn Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare at Reichman University in Israel, said the tunnels beneath Gaza were deeper and more sophisticated than cross-border passages used to sneak into Israeli territory. She told the BBC: The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence. The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand. Israel said it had already begun targeting the vast network as part of its bombing campaign in response to Saturday's unprecedented incursion. Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas: We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built, Jonathan Conricus an IDF spokesman, told a briefing on Thursday. These are not bunkers for Gazan civilians. It is only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel. Hamas started building tunnels in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops from the area almost two decades ago but ramped up the construction after both Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the area in 2007. After the last flare-up of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2021, the IDF claimed to have destroyed more than 60 miles of tunnels. Hamas, however, claimed at the time that only five per cent were damaged as it boasted that its underground infrastructure was at least 300 miles long, which makes it longer than the London Underground. The network, however, is out of bounds for civilians, and there are no underground shelters for residents in Gaza who have been living under constant airstrikes since Saturday. Even if the Israeli forces are able to clear the area, they will then have to decide whether to withdraw or to occupy the territory, which could take large numbers of troops.

Our information indicates that in recent weeks, North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on a call. It is unclear exactly how much materiel and munitions each container holds, but photos released Friday indicate the vessels are full-sized shipping containers of the type often seen on rail cars or cargo ships. We condemn the DPRK for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia's illegitimate war, added Kirby, using the official acronym for North Korea. US intelligence indicated some of the equipment began its journey in the North Korean port of Najin on Sept. 7 and arrived in the Russian coastal city of Dunay five days later. It was then transported by train across Russia before arriving at an ammunition depot near Tikhorestsk -- fewer than 300 miles east of the Crimean Peninsula -- on October 1. These arms transfers directly violate a series of UN Security Council resolutions, which is why we will continue to aggressively raise these arms deals at the UN alongside with our allies and partners, Kirby said. The burgeoning alliance among US adversaries is a worry for the Biden administration, with Kirby suggesting the North Korean assistance may be part of a quid pro quo. We also are increasingly concerned about Russian assistance to the DPRK in return for support, Kirby said. We assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic-missile production equipment or other materials and other advanced technologies. US intelligence assets are monitoring closely whether Moscow will provide Pyongyang with these materials, the NSC spokesman said. We have already observed that Russian ships are offloading containers in the DPRK, which may constitute the initial deliveries of material from Russia, Kirby said. This expanding military partnership between the DPRK and Russia, including any technology transfers from Russia to the DPRK, undermines both regional stability and the global non-proliferation regime. We will keep working to identify, expose and counter Russia's attempts to acquire military equipment from the DPRK and any state that is prepared to support its war on Ukraine.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"North Korea has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions.

All 23 coaches of the superfast train from Delhi's Anand Vihar Terminus to Assam's Kamakhya had derailed near Raghunathpur station, killing four people and leaving 71 injured. A 15-page joint note signed by the on-duty station master, points man, gateman, loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and track man has said that the accident may have been caused by a fault of the engineering department, the people said. The commissioner of railway safety (CRS), who is probing the accident, has recorded their statement, besides the injured passengers and locals. The issue was also discussed among the East Central Railway (ECR) officials at the accident site on Friday morning, they added. In their statement, gateman Nand Kishore Singh said that he saw sparking and heard heavy noise when the train was passing. Loco pilot Bipin Kumar Sinha said that when the train was crossing Raghunathpur home signal and a railway crossing he felt heavy vibration, jerk in the back portion of the locomotive and found pressure drop in the break pipe. If the loco pilot found pressure dropped during the running train, there is a possibility of one of the wheels getting down from the track leading to automatic break or a possibility of leakage in the brake pipe, said a senior official of the Indian Railway, who is part of the investigation team. He also said that 30 minutes before the incident, 15232 Down Durg-Barauni train, which was running on a changed route, passed on the same track and its loco pilot also felt vibration. In such a case, he has to inform the station manager about such vibrations and only an inquiry will reveal whether such information was shared with the station manager or not, said a railway official. Earlier on Thursday, two senior railways officials, on condition of anonymity, had said that the because of the derailment, according to a preliminary investigation, seemed to be a fault in the tracks, specifically a rail fracture, or a gap in the tracks. Meanwhile, a trial run was conducted on the affected railway tracks on Fiday, over 45 hours after the tragic railway accident. Several trains resumed operations on up line in the morning while the down line was restored for operation in the evening. Within 48 hours of the tragedy, train movement on up and down line was normalised. Train movement will begin from now, said chief public relations officer (CPRO) of East Central Railway, Birendra Kumar, adding that most of the debris has been cleared off the track.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"North East super-fast train derailed in Bihar's Buxar district on Wednesday night.

Our prisons are almost full. Last night the Times reported that 'Lord Justice Edis, the senior presiding judge for England and Wales, has ordered that sentencing of convicted criminals who are currently on bail should be delayed from Monday'. Prisons in England and Wales are now unable to find cell space for every criminal that judges believe should be jailed. This means that next week people convicted of very serious crimes, including historic sex offences, may be found guilty then sent home on bail. Beyond the obvious public protection concerns this delay to justice will further traumatise victims, and reduce confidence in the whole system. Anyone could have predicted this crisis. Last November, Damien Hinds, the prisons minister, activated Operation Safeguard - which makes police cells available to house prisoners for a maximum of one night if no prison cell is available. It is still in use. Our courts system is crumbling In March this year judges were urged to sentence more leniently in light of prison overcrowding. In May, Andrea Albutt, president of the Prison Governors' Association, warned of a 'capacity crisis'. Then the Chief Inspector of Prisons wrote about a prison population 'crisis' in August. The numbers make the problem clear. Over the last year the government has created about 90new prison places per week by making two prisoners share a single person cell, delaying maintenance work, transferring low risk prisoners to open conditions, deploying temporary prison cells, and opening new prisons (once they overcome local planning processes). However, each week up to 200 new prisoners enter the system. The Ministry of Justice blames a 'higher than usual number of offenders coming into prison this year'. Again though, this rise should have been expected. The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised 20,000 additional police officers, and in April of this year the PM announced that this had been achieved. It does not seem surprising that 20,000 more police officers might result in more arrests, but the rest of the system seems entirely unprepared. Similarly, in 2020 the government announced that violent and sexual offenders would spend longer in prison. While protecting the public in this way is popular, the result is further strain on our limited prison capacity. Our courts system is crumbling figuratively and literally and this creates further pressure. Before the pandemic the number of remand prisoners (those awaiting trial or sentencing) was around 9,500. During lockdown, with the courts disrupted, that number rose to around 13,000. While barristers were on strike in 2022 it rose to 15,500. By the end of June this year 15,500 prison spaces were occupied by remand prisoners. In the long-term we need to make prison work, reducing our high reoffending rate so that someone returning to prison become rare. But that work will take years. Right now the government needs to free up capacity in the prison system. This means looking at who can be released early. Home Detention Curfew, or 'tagging' allows low-risk, non-violent prisoners who have displayed good behaviour during their sentence to spend the final months before their conditional release date on curfew at their own homes. At present curfew is only available in the last 180 days of someone is sentence. Increasing this period to nine months, or even 12, would free up a substantial number of open prison spaces. As a result, lower risk prisoners would transfer to open prisons, creating capacity throughout the system. Another option is to adjust sentencing policy, avoiding the use of very short sentences of a few days or months. Much of the public may find this unpalatable if the result is prolific offenders being spared prison. In the same way we struggle to build rail and power capacity it seems we can no longer plan and create enough prison infrastructure. Politicians enact popular, aspirational policies, putting more police on the streets and jailing dangerous criminals for longer, when there is no serious chance of the prison system achieving the necessary capacity. It all feels emblematic of a government and state that has lost its ability to plan or function.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Prisons in England and Wales are now unable to find cell space for every criminal that judges believe should be jailed.

Police released the sketch Wednesday afternoon based on witness recollections of a man they saw on a recreational trail before finding 77-year-old Honoree Fleming dead with a gunshot wound to the head. She was killed on October 5 about one mile south of Vermont State University's Castleton Campus on the Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail. In addition to releasing the sketch to the public, detectives with the Vermont State Police continue to review potential evidence in the case, including forensic evidence with the assistance of the Vermont Forensic Laboratory at the Department of Public Safety in Waterbury, state police wrote on Wednesday. Police described the person as being a 5-foot-10 male in his 20s with short, red hair. He is considered armed and dangerous. Commander of the Vermont State Police Capt. Scott Dunlap told the Associated Press witnesses saw the man acting odd. He added police do not know if the shooting was random or targeted. The Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail is a 19.8-mile section of former railroad that cuts through scenic countryside with vistas of the nearby hills, villages, farms, fields and forests, according to its website. It is a multiple-use trail open to pedestrians, bicyclists, and horseback riders in the summer, and snowshoers, skiers and snowmobiles in the winter. Vermont State University Castleton campus confirmed that Fleming was a retired dean of education at the university. She previously worked as a faculty member at Trinity College, Middlebury College and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Fleming lived in Castleton with her husband Ron Powers, a Pulitzer Prize-winning and New York Times-bestselling author. The university reopened October 9 and resumed classes on October 10 after closing the week prior following Fleming's homicide. In a Facebook post, Powers said his wife was walking along her favorite trail near the college when she was killed. There is an area-wide dragnet out for her killer, he wrote. Police believe that it was random, but all possibilities remain open. Powers added he was with his son, Dean. Those of you who knew her know that she was beautifully named, he wrote about Fleming. I have never known a more sterling heart and soul than hers. She has taken far more than half my own heart and soul with her. In 2017, Powers wrote No One Cares About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health in America about his two sons with schizophrenia. One of his sons, Kevin, died in 2005.

Anyone that vacates the right of others to exist peacefully vacates the right of themselves to exist peacefully. When peace is vacated, humanity is vacated. The same is true of hate. Hate never has any justification. When compassion is vacated, so is humanity. There is nothing divine about either terrorism or hate -- both are diabolic. There is no such thing as a Holy War, all war is diabolic. Those who do not accept the diversity of others, do not allow the equality of others, will not treat others equitably, and will attempt to exclude their voice and free will in life, do not deserve to be accepted, do not deserve equality or equity, and do not deserve to have their voice heard or their free will in life abided. There are those among us who want to dominate, subjugate, control, and own others and force them to be the vanity of their own self-image. This is cruelty and not humanity. Acceptance and compassion are the human way and the only humanity will persist. If we do not awaken to this, we will be devoured by a nightmare made real. Robert Moreland, Lexington My father is an 84-year-old Palestinian, born near Bethlehem in 1939 in the town of Battir. He is not a terrorist. He is an electrical engineer. He is a man who escaped the unlivable conditions in Palestine 60 years ago and now watches yet another generation endure unimaginable suffering. He sheltered in caves of Bethlehem for one year in 1948 with his family, as over 500 Palestinian villages were destroyed; the state of Israel was being established. When my father returned to his house, as a 10-year-old boy, his home was standing, yet villages across the railroad tracks were gone. For those many Palestinian families who survived this trauma, yet no longer had homes, camps were established, such as those in the Gaza strip. This is a complicated human catastrophe. The Israel-Palestinian grief remains a constant. The families of Gaza, people marginalized by their mere existence, will not be able to pay for the terrorist attack last weekend. They have nothing to give. They never did. The tragedy unfolding now should be viewed as such. I pray our leaders will be able to see a path out of this seemingly forever failure to establish a plan for peaceful co-existence. Miriam Lightfoot, Lexington Let us hope Israel does not make the same mistake that the YOU.S. made in Vietnam during the incursion into Cambodia in May 1970. Israel's campaign should have no time limits nor limitations on where they can strike or how much destruction they can inflict; they must remove Hamas as an evil in the area. Only with Hamas's elimination can Israel find security and protect her people from future carnage. The American thrust into Cambodia was limited in duration and limited to 30 klicks when it should have been an unlimited deeper thrust. Sanctuaries were destroyed but not totally eradicated as the enemy rebuilt to return later to kill more Americans. It was a partial success. Hopefully, Israel will permanently destroy Hamas as a military, terrorist and political entity, and free the Palestinian people from the reign of terror existing in Gaza since 2007 when Hamas took control. In war, decisive measures of total destruction have proven to bring good results; Rome against Carthage, Genghis Khan against China, Sherman in Georgia and the YOU.S. against Japan. Evil forces only understand the same brutality they inflict on others. With Biden's open borders policies, the devastation seen in Israel is sadly coming to America! Robert Adams, Lexington I noticed that when the Republican candidate for governor, Ky. Attorney General Daniel Cameron, defended himself last week from Gov. Andy Beshear's advertisement regarding his extreme position on abortion, he did not mention anything about the survivor, Hadley, at all. When he was elected attorney general, he promised to do something about one of Kentucky's worst claims to fame: child abuse. In his defense against Hadley's rightful charge against him, Cameron said he cared. He cared about prosecuting the abusive stepfather and seemed to care about saving pregnancy tissue. But in my opinion, he does not care about the lives of pregnant people in Kentucky, a state with inordinately high negative pregnancy outcomes. That is not pro-life. That is using a politicized issue to win political power. Our governor's race with Gov. Andy Beshear running for reelection enjoys national attention. Beshear's popularity is well known as the guy who pulled Kentucky through a pandemic and multiple weather disasters with dignity, caring and respect while enduring constant law suits from Republicans. Frankfort's supermajority was happy wasting taxpayers money on legal fees instead of teacher raises and funding statewide schools. Nothing blew-up against Republicans like voters NO to Amendments 1 and 2: Adding days, collecting more money, power grabbing laws and a Trigger Law abortion ban that failed to include exceptions in the case of rape and incest. Republicans overreaching law touching every female in Kentucky is shocking, cruel and sick. Will voters surprise Republicans again? Beshear needs all five constitutional officers in the same party to work effectively together for even more wealth, success and protections for us. Beshear defied Republicans and won. The state is richer than ever and voters want women to know they will be safe in Kentucky. What a great PR billboard sign it will make. Welcome to Kentucky - Stupid does not live here anymore. Judy Rembacki, Georgetown A recent headline said, Ky. Governor poll shows Beshear with a big lead over Cameron was the best news I have heard in months. Thank you, Kentuckians, for realizing that we are so fortunate to have the one of the best governors in the YOU.S. and for realizing that it is extremely important to keep him for another four years. This is neither a comment on Cameron nor Republicans vs. Democrats, but rather a considered opinion about what is good for Kentucky. Harry Clarke, Lexington With announcements of infrastructure investments of rail, old issues arise. Was infrastructure investment in roads or bridges better than investment for access to fast passenger rail travel, maybe down interstate highway land? Why not invest in safe methods of ride sharing with ID cards and computerized methods for finding drivers going in the same direction? We need to cut down on individual car ownership and our individuals' investments as well as our desperate need for cars. Will we replace the massive number of semi-trucks on the roads, burning diesel and contributing to pollution now? We need to make sure truck drivers are not abused by the change while we think of ways to share work, not just create jobs. It is all a mistake that needs philosophical changes in American social, economic and political thinking. We cannot continue to ravish the earth for momentary pleasures. We cannot set, and advertise to the world, a lifestyle of spend, spend, spend while driving prices of our own simple living here up for many people. The future is not going to be a pleasant task, or sight to live in, for those we are forcing our mistakes on. Don Pratt, Lexington Our news streams are full of political information, opinions and polling results. This is a friendly reminder that our votes get the final say. Please vote. Karen Gerstle, Lexington News flash for Rep. Josh Calloway (R-Irvington) who said, One of the single greatest things we can do to clean up that public education system is to give parents choice and give them the opportunity to choose where they send their child to be educated. Parents already have that choice. But they do not have the right to ask someone else to pay for it. Nor should they. Carole Boyd, Lexington The media can capture hundreds of urban youth of color ravaging high-end stores, shattering store fronts and hauling out thousands of dollars worth of retail goods. Viral videos expose this urban decay for all the world to see. Social media coordinates and facilitates these attacks. Urban density is the perfect venue to display these horrendous events. What we seldom see are the hundreds of thousands of primarily white crimes that includes car thefts, car break-ins, garage thefts, porch bandits, and thefts of catalytic converters, copper, trade tools, farm equipment, guns and even animals. Viral video seldom catches these geographically diverse events. Flea markets fence these items every day without conscious recognition of the fruits of these theft events.

In a new warning, it said that both air and rail services could be impacted. It said anyone travelling should check with the travel operator before starting the journey. It said: Strike action in France on Friday 13 October may affect some rail and air services. Check with your travel operator before starting your journey. A demonstration is planned in Paris in the afternoon, moving from the Place d'Italie (in the 13th arrondissement) to the Place Vauban (7th arrondissement). Stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. The strikes could hit fans travelling to the continent as the Rugby World Cup reaches the quarter-final stages. Wales have a big match on Saturday against Argentina, with England playing Fiji on Sunday. Many airlines warned passengers to expect delays, the Liverpool Echo reported. On its website, easyJet said: We have been advised of a national strike in France starting 18:00 local time on Thursday 12th October to 06:00 Saturday 14th October. Air Traffic Control staff are joining the strike action and therefore like all airlines, our flights to and from French airports, as well as those flying in French airspace, could be affected. We expect that there will be delays and some disruption due to the industrial action, therefore we advise all customers to check the status of their flight on our flight tracker either on our mobile app or website: www.easyjet.comenflight-tracker Please also be aware that public transport services may be affected by the strike. We recommend all customers allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport and consider alternative transport options where possible. Ryanair said: Due to the French ATC strike on Friday, we have been forced to cancel a small number of flights mainly overflying France. Affected passengers have been notified of their options to change flights (free of charge) or receive a full refund. So far in 2023, there has been 64 days of ATC strikes (over 12 times more than in 2022) forcing airlines to cancel thousands of EU overflights from Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the UK, while France uses Minimum Service Laws to protect French flights. This is unfair. France (and all other EU states) should protect overflights during ATC strikes as they do in Spain, Italy and Greece, and cancel flights tofrom the affected State. Ryanair sincerely apologises to affected passengers for any inconvenience as a result of these French ATC strike disruptions, which are beyond Ryanair's control. Jet2 also alerted passengers of the strike and added: Whilst we are unsure of any disruption this may cause there is a possibility of disruption to flights that are due to operate within French airspace. For us to achieve departures as close to our published schedules, it is necessary for us to close our check-in desks and board flights in line with your flight's scheduled departure time. Check-in will close 40 minutes before your scheduled departure, and we will board your flight on time in order to get you on your way as quickly as possible.

Across the country, people begin to stir. They pour their cups of coffee, they butter their toast, and they turn on the news. Boris Johnson has won the 2019 general election for the Conservative party, with a thumping majority of 80 seats. The Labour party of Jeremy Corbyn is in utter disarray, with their so called red wall of seats in northern England in pieces, replaced by a corresponding blue wall of Conservative MPs. The question over why the red wall crumbled will haunt journalists for years to come- was it because of Brexit? Was it a fear of Corbyn? Was it a distrust in Labour over the economy? Was it the promise of levelling up? If the fall of the red wall was for any of those reasons, then the voters who switched from Labour to Conservative must be severely disappointed. Brexit has arguably been a failure- the oven ready deal that Johnson campaigned on in 2019 did not exist and the flourishing economy that voters were promised is now in the shackles of a cost-of-living crisis affecting millions. Even Brexiteer-in-Chief Nigel Farage admitted on Newsnight that Brexit has been a failure (of course, he still believes in the because, but the admission speaks volumes), and I am sure that the 3 million people who were recipients of a food bank parcel last year would agree. Voters who feared Corbyn and how he would handle the economy must be laughing- after 49 days of a Liz Truss government, a Corbyn economy must seem like utopian bliss. Arguably, the promise of Johnson to level up is why so many of the red wall voters switched over to the Conservatives. Whether or not you believed in Brexit, the promise of billions being invested into deprived areas was an appealing policy. Part of the levelling up agenda announced in 2019 included a commitment to invest in Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester with a focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle as part of a 100bn National Infrastructure Strategy. These rail connections relied on an existing and ongoing rail project, High Speed Two (HS2), but as all major parties had committed to this in 2010, voters did not appear concerned that Northern Powerhouse Rail, or even HS2, would not be able to go ahead. Levelling up was happening, and people were turning out in their dozens to vote for Johnson's Conservative party. HS2 is the high-speed rail network that was planned to link London and major cities in the north and the midlands. Proposed in 2010, the line was meant to connect London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, but in 2021 the Leeds leg was scrapped over concerns surrounding the rising cost of the project, and during the Conservative Party Conference in October 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the line between Birmingham and Manchester was going to be abandoned in favour of spending the money on local infrastructure. What was once a revolutionary project, designed to link London with the north via high-speed rail, and create hubs between major northern cities, is now a journey from Birmingham Curzon Street Station to London Euston. He has said that the line will run up to Manchester, just not at high speed like the initial promise. HS2 has failed. The dreams of high-speed rail linking the country is just that. A dream. A dream that has cost the government 100 billion, and that is not including the cost of the trains. How has the government of a G7 country failed so horribly at something that should be so simple- France has just commissioned 203 miles of high-speed rail starting in Bordeaux, and this is estimated to cost 12 billion. That is double the length of the London to Birmingham route, at just 12 of the cost. So why has HS2 been so expensive compared to other countries? The answer is simple- a large amount of the route that HS2 takes cuts through marginal Conservative constituencies, and so the residents must be consulted, and MPs must be appeased. Additionally, the cost of building supplies has increased with inflation and the war in Ukraine, and the actual building of tracks and creating tunnels is expensive. Despite these factors, the fact that it has taken a government nine years to get the building of 330 miles of railway tracks underway is shameful, and the lack of this railway network will be felt across the country. The lack of HS2 will be felt most notably in the north of England, as the proposed project of Northern Powerhouse Rail relies on a section of track between Manchester and Liverpool being shared with the HS2 line. Now that HS2 is not being built, the lack of this section of the line throws the future of Northern Powerhouse Rail into question. Even if Rishi Sunak is promising 36 billion in transport infrastructure for the north, this does not answer the question of how this issue is going to be solved. It also does not fix the fact that these plans have been in the works for years, and he has let down the north, again. As Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said at a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference, This will be remembered as the conference when they pulled the plug on us. What gives them the right to treat people here in Greater Manchester and the north of England as second-class citizens?. Sunak is not only facing criticism from members of the Labour Party- the Conservative politician Andy Street said at an impromptu press conference that Sunak will be turning his back on an opportunity to level up - a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Burnham and Street are right. People of the north have consistently been treated as second class citizens, and it speaks to the wider views of the Conservative government that they are cancelling a project that would create a powerful northern economy, one that could potentially grow to provide huge benefits for the country. This let down of the north is potentially going to be what costs Sunak the general election- if you were promised levelling up in 2019, why on earth would you believe in anything else the Conservatives promise you? The cancellation of HS2 is not levelling up by any stretch of the imagination. This is not the country that those red-turned-blue-wall voters were promised in 2019. This is an abject failure by a government that is tumbling down in the opinion polls, trying to grasp onto anything that might save them. Scrapping HS2 will not be their saving grace. True investment in the north means ensuring that levelling up is not just a campaign slogan but is something that people can point to and say that it was a genuine success. Levelling up was always meant to be about giving funds where they were most needed- if HS2 is not deemed worthy, other causes must be found.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Boris Johnson has won the 2019 general election for the Conservative party, with a thumping majority of 80 seats.

Vale of Glamorgan Council has confirmed that there are still no buses set to service the transport project in Barry, Wales. Barry Transport Interchange, situated outside Barry Docks Railway Station, was developed to improve connectivity in the Vale and so far includes a taxi rank, bike shelters and bus stops. The leader of the Plaid Cymru group at Vale of Glamorgan Council, Cllr Ian Johnson, called the project in its current state a waste of public money. Bus companies across Wales are struggling at the moment due to reduced funding and recovering passenger numbers following the Covid-19 pandemic, WalesOnline writes. Many services have recently been changed or cut altogether. Cllr Ian Johnson said: Vale of Glamorgan Council officers have done very well in ensuring that the bus station has been built, but there is no point in a bus station with no buses. He added: There is nothing new about the drop in passengers following Covid-19, and that was known well before the construction of the bus station earlier this year. This is a major multi-million pound project that will not be used at any time soon for the reason it was built. That is a waste of public money at a time when the Labour Council are telling us to get ready for large scale cuts. Construction on phase one of Barry Transport Interchange started in January, 2023, and electric car charging points will soon be connected to the site. Adventure Travel's number 88 bus service was originally supposed to take passengers to and from the new interchange, but it has since been withdrawn. Vale of Glamorgan Council said in April that Cardiff Bus was considering which of its services could operate at the interchange. The company later announced that it was also withdrawing and making changes to a number of its services from September and no services were shown to be set to operate at Barry Transport Interchange in updated timetables. At a Vale of Glamorgan Council meeting on September 25, Cllr Ian Johnson asked what conversations cabinet members were having with other authorities and the Welsh Government with regards to ensuring that revenue funding is found for bus services in the future. In response, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for neighbourhood and building services, Cllr Mark Wilson, said: We have regular meetings with our fellow cabinet members to discuss this and we lobby Welsh Government, along with other local authorities, to get a bigger chunk of available funding. A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesperson said: Unfortunately, the interchange has been completed at a very difficult time for the bus industry. Reductions in government funding, reduced post-pandemic passenger numbers, and a shortage of drivers have all contributed to reductions in bus services. In the short term the new interchange will be used for Transport for Wales rail replacement services while upgrades to the local train network are undertaken. The council is also in discussions with local bus providers to see if the new interchange can be incorporated into any existing routes. In the long term, as new residential developments in the area are completed, we anticipate that there will be a commercial interest from the local bus operators that currently serve Barry and we still expect the interchange to come into regular use. This is only one aspect of the council's work to support bus services in the Vale. Since April, the council has increased spending on local bus services by more than 100,000, taking our total investment this year to around 500,000. This funding has been used to provide bus services where companies do not operate on a commercial basis, including the rural Vale, and to pay operators to run services that we know are valued by the community in the evening and on weekends.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"Barry Transport Interchange was built to improve connectivity in the Vale.

Honoree Fleming, 77, was discovered dead on 5 October on a hiking trail near Vermont State University Castleton Campus, where she used to work. The sketch was based on witness descriptions of a man they saw enter the trail before her body was found. The killing has shocked the small town of Castleton, Vermont. Police say the suspect is a 5ft 10in (1.78m) white male with red hair who seemed to be in his 20s. They say he wore a dark grey T-shirt and a black backpack and is armed and dangerous. There was more than one witness that observed this individual just prior to coming across Miss Fleming's body, Vermont State Police Captain Scott Dunlap told a news conference on Wednesday. He said without elaborating that the potential suspect was observed to be acting very strangely. It is unclear if the shooting was targeted or random. Police are asking anyone who recognises the man in the sketch to come forward. Officials did not release any other details about the case, which has been ruled a homicide. The Burlington Medical Examiner's office determined Ms Fleming died from the gunshot wound to the head. She was attacked while on her regular afternoon walk last Thursday along the Delaware and Hudson Rail Trail, a 20-mile (32km) section of former railway that is used by pedestrians and cyclists. Ms Fleming was the dean of education at Vermont State University before she retired in 2012. In a statement on Facebook, the college said more police would patrol the campus. The university said Ms Fleming was beloved by faculty, staff and students. A professor of education and biochemist, she was still publishing academic papers on cellular biology. Her contributions to education and her impact on our campus will live on in all of us, the college said.

Heavy downpours began affecting London last night, with Victoria station on the London Underground part closed today due to flooding. Eastbound Circle and District line trains were not stopping at the station during the morning rush hour. Tube passenger Martin O'Keefe tweeted this morning: 'I do not know how this godforsaken country ever thought it could deliver HS2 when the UK's current rail infrastructure will not even allow half the trains on the Circle and District Line to stop at London Victoria due to flooding. Absolutely pathetic.' Nearly three inches of rain could fall in parts of southern England and Wales over today and tomorrow - with the Met Office warning of possible travel delays. A yellow weather warning for rain was imposed over all of southern England, the West Midlands and the whole of Wales from 9pm tonight until the end of tomorrow - with up to 1.2in (30mm) in two hours and 2.8in (70mm) over the 27-hour period. Early this morning, the mercury dropped to -2C (28F) at Katesbridge in Northern Ireland and -1C (30F) at Eskdalemuir in Scotland, where snow on the mountains is possible in the coming days - as well as a widespread overnight frost across the UK. This weekend, lows of -3C (27F) in Scotland and Northern Ireland could lead to air frosts while cities of England will drop to 2C (36F), potentially colder in rural areas. It comes after Britain enjoyed its longest run of consecutive October days above 25C (77F) since 1959, with four recorded between Saturday and Tuesday. Sunday was the UK's warmest October day in five years as temperatures hit 25.8C (78.4F) in London. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: 'On Wednesday night, there may potentially be some frosts and much colder than average conditions, which might be a shock for northern parts of Britain because we have had this relatively warm air across most of the UK. There will be an increasing tendency towards cooler conditions, however in the southern parts of England and Wales we have got the prospect of heavy rain coming in.' 'We are saying there is a significant rain warning from 9pm on Thursday through to midnight on Friday, and we can expect 20mm (0.8in) to 30mm (1.2in) in some places in a couple of hours. Even up to 50mm (2in), 60mm (2.4in) or possibly up to 70mm (2.8in) across the high ground of Wales, these are significant amounts. Once that warning expires, we have got another shift in our weather pattern where we are getting a more northerly flow coming in. That will introduce much cooler conditions, six degrees below average, which given the fact a few days ago we were talking about conditions six or so degrees above average, will feel like a marked contrast. We have got the prospect on Saturday of early frost in some sheltered northern areas, even some snowfall over the Scottish mountains.' The warning over flooding in England and Wales coms after Scotland was battered by heavy rainfall last weekend, causing flooding and leading to train cancellations and road closures. Some railway stations flooded, with tracks under feet of water. On Tuesday night, the body of a man was recovered from the River Tay in Newport-on-Tay, Fife, after a major search operation. His identity and age are not known, but it was not connected to the search for missing Struan Robertson, 77, who was swept away by floods as his helpless wife Patricia watched on. The family of Struan Robertson, 77, who owns the Pitcastle Estate in Strathtay, Perthshire, fear he has lost his life. Mr Robertson was engulfed by the swollen River Tay and dragged downstream by the powerful current as he tried to clear a clogged hydropower device. Also along the River Tay, caravans and tents were pictured under water at Aberfeldy Caravan Park in Perth and Kinross. Elsewhere, ten motorists were airlifted to safety on Saturday due to landslides on the A83 in Argyll and Bute, which dislodged 2,000 tonnes of debris. Another four were airlifted in Kilmartin, Argyll and Bute. The A83 between the Rest And Be Thankful and Inveraray was closed for work to remove debris from landslips, but has since reopened. Six further landslips were identified as a result of the work, Bear Scotland said. Meanwhile, farmers across Scotland suffered millions of pounds worth of losses in unharvested crops after a month's worth of rain fell in just 24 hours. High-value produce including turnips, broccoli and potatoes were destroyed in the weekend deluge, with the agricultural industry fearing it has suffered one of its worst ever losses. Thousands of acres of farmland remain under water, with some farmers losing entire fields of crops, including 350,000 worth of swedes at a farm Perthshire. But conditions were beautiful in southern England over the weekend, with the Met Office saying 25.8C (78.4F) at Kew Gardens in London on Sunday was the highest October temperature since 26.5C (79.7F) was recorded at Donna Nook, Lincolnshire, in 2018.

In closing arguments Wednesday, attorneys for the city said developer Phil Tagami and corporate partner Insight Terminal Solutions failed to meet key deadlines in the construction of a large marine terminal that would ship bulk goods at the former Army Base in West Oakland. Tagami, however, contends that the city intentionally stalled the project in order to prevent the transport of coal through the harbor -- having failed once before to ban coal from passing through Oakland altogether. The pollutant has proven to be politically toxic in Oakland. Environmental advocates have warned for years that coal dust mixed with the open air could worsen West Oakland's air quality. The ensuing legal and public fight has put construction of the terminal on hold since it was first approved about a decade ago. The city knew that its contracts with the plaintiffs in applicable federal law allowed the plaintiffs to (ship) coal, said Tagami's lawyer, Barry Lee. For political -- rather than legal -- reasons, city leaders refused to accept that outcome. With the eight-week trial now wrapped, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Nol Wise will make a ruling in the coming weeks after assessing a complicated timeline of contract negotiations, agreements and delays. The key arguments rest on the idea of force majeure, a common legal clause in contracts that prevents either party from being held liable when a sudden event -- such as a change in the law -- interrupts the agreement. Danielle Leonard, an outside counsel representing the city, said Wednesday that Tagami lagged behind on building the terminal because he was hunting for a sublease that could subsidize some construction costs. She cited testimony from former Mayor Libby Schaaf and other city officials, who said during the trial that they wanted to see the project move forward. There is simply no evidence of a city political conspiracy to block the terminal, Leonard said, because that is simply not what happened. She added later that the delay was due to Tagami's economic self-interest. Judge Wise will consider an exhaustive set of evidence that shapes the timeline of how the contract fell apart, along with the two sides' wildly different characterizations of the documents. At one point, the two sides disagreed whether some railway improvements made by Tagami's team indicated that he was trying to reach his milestones, or if that bit of infrastructure was irrelevant to the original development agreement. The terminal in question, if it is ever built, would store bulk commodities that arrive by rail from Utah -- where the state legislature has dished out 53 million for the Oakland coal project -- before shipping them overseas. The facility would only store coal, and not burn it, but environmentalists have pressured Oakland to divest entirely from the pollutive industry. A study in Richmond this year found that rail conveyance of coal increased the number of fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5, in the atmosphere because of how coal dust mixes into the air. Emergency room visits or hospitalizations for asthma, meanwhile, are two times higher in West Oakland than the rest of Alameda County, according to a 2018 county study, which activists have ascribed to poor air quality. The larger issue of whether Tagami can ship coal was already decided in 2020 when a court determined the city had not provided enough evidence to ban the transport of coal over health concerns. And while the latest lawsuit centers around the technical details of a contract dispute, its larger implications could effectively determine the future of coal in Oakland -- a focal point of the closing argument by Tagami's attorney. The city simply said, 'You are not going build this terminal, Lee said, 'because we know once you build it, coal could be handled -- and that is politically unacceptable.'",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"A judge will make a ruling in the coming weeks after assessing a complicated timeline of contract negotiations, agreements and delays.

At its last stop, near the Chinese border, brand-new residential towers rise out of the jungle. China funded much of the glistening new infrastructure that has transformed this landlocked country of 7.5 million people. The building boom showcases the kind of modernity China says it can offer the world, notably the high-speed Laos-China railway that in a feat of engineering transformed a two-day journey across the country into a sleek three-hour trip. The line was built by Chinese engineers to Chinese rail standards, allowing it to connect to China's high-speed network. But Laos is also an economy in distress. Inflation rose to more than 41 percent at its peak this spring. The Laotian kip has depreciated more than 43 percent against the YOU.S. dollar. In a country where virtually everything is imported, the statistics translate into sacrifice: farmers who can no longer afford fertilizer, children who have dropped out of school to work and families cutting back on health care. The China-led strategy was meant to protect Laos from these shocks -- instead, it led to them. Laos is struggling to repay the billions it borrowed from China to fund the hydroelectric dams, trains and highways, which have drained the country of foreign reserves. As repayments drag, external debt is rising, a vulnerability exacerbated by the pandemic and rising global fuel and food prices. The AidData research lab at William  Mary, which tracks China's lending, calculates Laos's total debt to China over an 18-year period starting in 2000 to be at 12.2 billion -- about 65 percent of gross domestic product. Add in loans from other agencies and countries, and Laos's debt stands at more than 120 percent, according to AidData. There is no country in the world with a higher amount of debt exposure to China than Laos. It is a very, very extreme example, said Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. Laos went on a borrowing spree and got in over its head. Laos has had to make compromises, including on its own sovereignty, to appease Beijing and seek some financial forbearance, allowing Chinese security agents and police to operate in the country as Beijing extends its repression beyond its borders, according to human rights groups and Lao activists. The Laotian electrical grid is now partly controlled by China, in what analysts believe is a trade-off in lieu of debt repayments. A Chinese company provides security for the new train line. China also faces difficult choices. It cannot let Laos default, as Beijing's regional strategy rests on success here. The rail line cutting through Laos is intended to extend into Thailand and Malaysia, and then Singapore, creating a network at the heart of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's ambitions. Laos is also one of the few relative success stories for China, at a time where its Belt and Road Initiative is shrinking or being reevaluated elsewhere, forcing Beijing to focus on its most strategic goals -- integrating its closest neighbors among them. Laos is the ticket to be closer to Southeast Asia, said Toshiro Nishizawa, a professor at the University of Tokyo who specializes in economic and development policy and has advised the government of Laos. Beijing has so far been very generous by allowing Laos to defer payments, Nishizawa added, but it cannot postpone the problem indefinitely. Debt forgiveness to countries like Laos will also open up China to similar requests from governments around the globe. Beijing has loaned almost 1 trillion to developing nations in the past two decades, a mammoth amount that has fundamentally reshaped China's position in the world. We are now getting acquainted with China as the world's largest debt collector, said Parks at AidData, something that is uncharted territory for both the borrowers and China. It is challenging not to let this affect your diplomatic relations, Parks said. The Laotian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for the Laos-China Railway Company Ltd. referred questions to the Laos Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Laos and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent via email and fax. Riding the new Chinese-built high-speed rail from Vientiane, the capital, to Boten, and then back down to the tranquil tourist town of Luang Prabang, revealed a landlocked country torn between a recognition of its limitations -- no progress would have been possible without China -- and deeply anxious about its reliance on Beijing. Lao people have begun to express unprecedented discontent online, targeted at China and their own government, rare in a one-party socialist state where critics are harassed and even disappeared. Lao on social media most recently expressed outrage at reports in late August that a Chinese mining company had detained some 50 villagers for illegally digging gold in a part of northern Laos where the company held a concession and demanded a ransom for their release. Laos is so indebted to China that the Chinese can come over here and take our land, said Nin, a 23-year-old vegetable and condiments seller at a local market in Vientiane, who like other Lao spoke on the condition of anonymity or only with their first name for fear of retribution. Chinese companies, she said, can use Lao workers however they please. Surveys show a remarkable shift in sentiment away from China to other Asian and Western nations -- most surprisingly to the United States, which rained some 270 million cluster bombs down on Laos during a covert campaign in tandem with the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. This year's State of Southeast Asia survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore saw a majority of respondents from Laos, almost 60 percent, say they would prefer the region to align with the United States over China, a sharp reversal from the previous year's survey. A growing number of respondents, more than 72 percent, also indicated they were worried about China's economic influence. When Laos developed a vision for itself as the battery of Asia, hoping to export electricity primarily generated by hydropower, it looked north to China for support. Chinese companies arrived to build dams and supporting infrastructure. Other Chinese businesses followed, making large-scale investments in mining, agriculture and telecommunications. In 2013, China became the largest foreign investor in Laos with some 5 billion spread across 745 projects, overtaking Thailand. The high-speed railway from the Laotian capital of Vientiane to the border town of Boten and then into Yunnan province in China became the signature project in this new relationship, despite warnings from economists about the debt Laos was taking on to build it. The commercial rationale for the railway was also weak, according to a report by the Asian Development Bank, with costs outweighing benefits even if the line eventually connected to Malaysia and Singapore. Seventy-five tunnels, 167 bridges and 6 billion later, the single-track railway opened in December 2021. Chinese state media made a special effort to highlight one of the most challenging technical aspects of constructing the railway: clearing unexploded ordnance left behind by the United States during its bombing campaign. A columnist from the Chinese state-run Global Times later declared that the US dropped bombs in Laos, while China builds railways. Covid restrictions were still in place in Beijing at the time of the opening, forcing Xi to officiate remotely. With the railway, the mountain from Kunming to Vientiane is no longer high and the road is no longer long, Xi said in a speech telecast by video link to a room full of Lao officials. A beaming Lao President Thongloun Sisoulith responded that his country had finally realized its dream of building a rail connection to its powerful neighbor and beyond. Two-way cross-border passenger services between Laos and China started in April. On a recent morning outside the Vientiane station -- a structure more imposing than the capital's airport -- visibly excited passengers extended their selfie sticks for photos. Still, it is not passenger travel that will reap benefits for Laos, analysts say, but freight -- and so far that has largely traveled in one direction, with goods exported from China coming into Laos and then on to Thailand. Only a few companies in Laos have been using the link to export products to China, and they have been almost exclusively Chinese, business executives say. As an Australian company, we have not seen the benefits, said one executive in Laos, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Only companies connected to the Chinese and Lao investors in the project appear to be able to get access, and without those connections, it is almost impossible to utilize the rail, the executive added. The Laotian government said it expects the railway, a 70-30 joint venture between Chinese state-owned companies and a Laotian one, to be profitable by 2026. But the parent company, which has no revenue other than that generated by the railway, has to not only be profitable but also pay back the 3.54 billion loan it obtained from the state-run Export-Import Bank of China. If the railway revenues are insufficient ... it is ambiguous who would bail that company out, Parks said. It is a phantom menace for Laos: They do not know whether they are going to be responsible for a small part of this debt, a big part or none at all. The crowd on the train had thinned by the time it pulled into the last station on the Laos side of the border. The town of Boten in the early 2000s was transformed by a private Hong Kong-based company from a remote outpost on Laos's northern fringe to a casino boomtown. Tourists from China, and also from other parts of Laos and neighboring Thailand, flocked to its nightclubs and gambling dens. Boten was designated as a special economic zone with a major casino as its centerpiece business. Built largely for Chinese visitors, for whom gambling is illegal back home, the town soon devolved into lawlessness. The Chinese government, in response, cut off electricity and telecommunication services to the zone, which came from neighboring Yunnan. The casino was forced to shut. Decay set in. Paint began peeling off the pink and yellow buildings. The Belt and Road Initiative offered Boten a new lease on life as the first stop in Beijing's plans to economically and physically integrate its neighbors. The special economic zone was rebranded from Boten Golden City, its moniker as a gambling destination, to Boten Beautiful Land. Haicheng Holdings, a private Yunnan-based developer, started to build residential buildings and schools in the town, hoping for a rush of Chinese migrants following the expected boom. Advertisements in Haicheng's showroom feature multiple photos of Xi with Lao officials calling Boten a pilot zone for deepening regional cooperation. Outside the marbled showroom, the reality of Boten bears little resemblance to Haicheng's gilded model city, and the marketing has done little to she would its unsavory past. The zone is devoid of the kind of suited businesspeople and bustling factories it claims to attract, or even tourists. Instead, Boten's few thousand residents are overwhelmingly Chinese workers building new residential towers and those working in services catering to them -- Chinese restaurants, Chinese shops and brothels. Private security guards with Chinese flags on their flak jackets police the area. Virtually no shops are run or owned by Lao. Businesses almost exclusively accept Chinese yuan rather than local currency. Steaming hot pot, barbecued meats and noodles in lava-red soup are featured here over Lao dishes like sticky rice and laab. By night, young women sit outside brothels bathed in purple and pink neon lights, while their handlers try to cajole Chinese men walking outside to come in. Phet, 32, is one of the few remaining Lao shopkeepers in the zone, running a small convenience store that sells snacks and Lao food made in a tiny back kitchen. He said he saw an initial rush of people when the train first opened, but business has since died down. The train has allowed Chinese visitors to bypass Boten, going directly on to Vientiane or Luang Prabang and returning to China without again getting off. Most difficult of all: Phet's landlord accepts rent only in Chinese yuan; with the devalued Lao kip, the cost of running his business has skyrocketed. Chinese bosses are so much stricter than Lao bosses, he said. We have no ability to negotiate with them. We cannot talk to them. Soutchai Phouthivong, 60, has driven a songthaew -- a pickup truck that functions as a shared taxi -- since the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge opened in 1994, ferrying people from the immigration checkpoint near Vientiane to Thai malls and restaurants in Nong Khai. Lao, particularly lower-income families who do not have cars, are his main customers. His income, he said, has fallen by more than half this year. Look, it is now almost noon and there are no Lao people around, Phouthivong said on a recent Wednesday. I am lucky to do one or two trips a day. What was once a routine trip for many Lao -- to seek medical treatment, buy goods that they cannot find at home or simply enjoy a weekend outing -- has become unaffordable because of the falling Lao currency and inflation. In Vientiane, prices are soaring for basics. A 52-year-old seller of dry goods said the noodles have tripled in price, turning from a staple to a luxury. Sonesavanh, a 46-year-old whose husband has depression, has turned to Buddhist healing, seeking blessings from monks and trying to improve their luck by rearranging furniture, because the medical treatment he needs in Thailand is now unaffordable. It is like a race between the economy and my husband, to see which one will get better first, she said. Discontent with both China and the Laotian government have melded together at this point, said Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations who wrote in April about popular unrest in Laos. It has turned into a generalized anger at China overall. You do not see that anger at other partners critical to Laos, like Thailand and Vietnam. In March 2022, Anousa Luangsuphom, 25 -- an activist widely known as Jack in Laos -- launched a Facebook page called The Power of the Keyboard, using satire and memes to criticize both his government and China's reach into his country. He also called for the end of one-party rule in Laos. On April 29, Jack changed his Facebook profile picture to one bearing the motto Fighting for Laos' survival, so we do not become China's slave. He then went about his day -- serving khao piak sen, a Lao noodle soup dish, at the shop he worked in, before meeting friends at a coffee shop and bar. That evening, a man entered the bar and asked in a few words of Lao if Jack was around. He briefly exited before returning and shooting Jack in the face and chest. I did not know what had happened to me, Jack said in an interview, his first since the attack. I just heard people calling my name. Jack was initially treated in a Laotian government hospital, before the Manushya Foundation, a human rights group, organized his medical evacuation. Doctors outside of Laos worked to reconstruct his jaw, but they predicted he would not regain speech for a year because of the extensive damage. Now in a safe location, Jack is relearning basic functions. He has difficulty chewing, and while he can speak, he struggles to articulate his words. He habitually touches the circle-shaped scar to the right of his lips, where the bullet entered his cheek. Jack does not know who shot him; he also has not been able to look at the video of his shooting, which was widely shared on Lao social media. All he does know is that the day he was shot, he had explicitly posted about what he called China's monopoly over Laos, which he described in an interview as tantamount to an invasion. Jack is trying to rebuild his life, helping activists get better at social media while waiting for more surgeries to fix his jaw and fully restore his speech. But Jack has stopped saying anything negative online about the Chinese government, or Chinese-linked projects in Laos. In the months following his shooting, two Chinese dissidents -- free-speech activist Yang Zewei, also known as Qiao Xinxin, and prominent human rights lawyer Lu Siwei -- were taken into custody in Laos. Yang resurfaced more than two months later in a Chinese detention center and has been charged with subversion of state power. Lu was deported to China in mid-September, despite pressure from Western governments and the United Nations to release him and allow him to travel to the United States, where his wife and daughter resettled last year. Lu had a YOU.S. visa. In a statement on October 11, the State Department condemned Lu's forced repatriation, which it said was at the request of Chinese authorities. Jack's fear now is that China's growing transnational policing will ensnare him, too. I did not realize that talking about China would get me shot, Jack said. I did not realize that talking about China is more dangerous than talking about the Lao government.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"China funded much of the glistening new infrastructure that has transformed Laos.

It reminds us that barbaric aggressors have no human compassion and are driven by an insatiable appetite for theft and atrocities. It is worth remembering that about a century ago, in the short span of five years, the Armenians experienced the beginning of the Genocide of 1915, the rebirth from the ashes at Sardarabad and the cruel division of our hope by the Turks and Soviet Russians. In 1988, the horrific earthquake occurred, followed by the brutal deportations of Armenians from Baku, only to be followed by the Artsakh liberation movement and the independence of Armenia -- all within three years. Sometimes we are forced to postpone the full cycle of mourning in order to take advantage of an opportunity or prevent further losses. It is surreal to internalize that we have just witnessed what was considered unthinkable in our conscious reality. Our position can and has changed quickly -- from humiliation to optimism and the inverse. It is never as hopeless as we may feel during difficult times and never as positive as we may believe during hopeful times. We must be ever cautious and self serving. Our experiences in Artsakh over the last 30 years teach us that painful lesson. Given the calamitous tragedies that have been our history, it is important to avoid wild swings in our emotions. This is where leadership earns its credibility, whether it is religious, political or social in nature. Leadership helps us avoid the peaks and valleys that can leave us damaged. The prevailing view in our communities is that the loss of Artsakh will not satisfy the genocidal motivations of criminal Azerbaijan. Armenians are living in fear today, as they have lost hope in their leaders and other nations. Is our sovereignty as a nation state the next chapter? Are we simply waiting for the enemy? The Azeris are coy but uncomplicated. They usually telegraph their next exploits. While the Europeans and United States issued statements of concern and diplomatic consequences, the Azeris ignored civility by amassing troops on the border before their assault on Artsakh last month. War games were organized with their complicit genocidal cousins prior to the 2020 war. With the blood still fresh from occupied Artsakh and the deported residents seeking a new life, Aliyev, emboldened by a lack of military and diplomatic resistance, now speaks of demanding eight enclaves, while he audaciously occupies 145 km of sovereign Armenian territory, holds POWs from 2020 and arrests the leaders of Artsakh. When there is little substantive opposition from foreign powers, he is free to demand almost anything. Even though Azerbaijan has committed genocide and numerous other criminal acts, the Europeans have not sanctioned Azerbaijan, because Azeri energy is more important than their often-stated principles of human rights, freedom and the rule of law. The United States has not even been able to end the waiver of section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Regardless of the quantity of weapons shipped, it is a clear statement of values when they pander to a terrorist state. The relationship with Israel is also a major variable. The current war with the Palestinians has heightened the wall between Iran and the West, particularly the United States. Despite the despicable Azeri-Israeli arrangement of energy and spy presence in return for billions in military hardware used to kill Armenians, the YOU.S. is not expected to sanction Azerbaijan. The YOU.S. may be motivated to outflank the Russians in the Caucasus, but apparently not at the expense of rogue Azerbaijan. In addition, Aliyev continues to rant about the Zangezur Corridor. Imagine the arrogance of two nations, Azerbaijan and Turkey, demanding a sovereign corridor to connect their stolen land that would unite the Turkish criminals and would severely wound Armenia. Despite the outrageous nature of their demand, it is considered one of the prime motivators for conflict in the Syunik region. Recently, there have been sources, one Iranian and the other Azeri, suggesting that Azerbaijan is considering a Plan B to Zangezur due to Armenian opposition. The Pashinyan government has consistently stated that there was never such an agreement in the trilateral statement of November 2020 and that Armenia would never accept such a concept. For its part, Russia has also stated that such an agreement does not exist. Given Russia's duplicitous politics towards Armenia, this should not be considered a reliable commitment for Armenia. The Plan B is a rail and land link on the Iranian side of the Armenian border. This plan is not a sovereign Azeri corridor and would be subject to the normal border and customs controls of the host nation. Iran seems to be offering this as an alternative to protect their interests in any territorial changes. Some sources believe Azerbaijan may find favor with this. Do not believe a word of this. Azerbaijan wants the Zangezur corridor for two reasons: to establish a land route to connect Turkey, Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan and to destroy Armenian sovereignty. Plan B does not address the latter. They also want at least the eastern shore of Lake Sevan. In this sea of chaos, two conclusions can be drawn: Azerbaijan will attack, and Armenia should not expect much military support from the western defenders of democracy. In light of the ominous clouds coming from the east, what should Armenia do to thwart such a challenge? As a baseline position, Armenia should continue bilateral talks with both Turkey on normalization and with Azerbaijan on a peace agenda. Let us not fool ourselves. The Turks and Azeris are looking for capitulation and destruction of our sovereign state, but negotiating can serve as a small deterrent with Russian, YOU.S. and European sponsorship. The best case scenario is that Azerbaijan will continue to be uncooperative, which could strengthen the Armenian position. The European organizers must have been annoyed with the Aliyev boycott of the recent Granada sideline discussion. Armenia's presence prevented a total embarrassment, but certainly not enough to overcome Europe's energy obsession. Talk of sanctions by members of the European Parliament should not raise optimism on the Armenian side. The Americans have had similar rumbling, but Congress is not in a position to pass binding legislation, and the State Department will only serve as a mediator. After publicly criticizing Armenia, the Russians have signaled that they may be willing to sponsor another round of trilateral talks. Of course, this type of gamesmanship should be expected, as the Russians will alternate short-term tactical positions to serve the longer term interest of controlling their backyard. The high volume of diplomatic engagement by the Armenian government may yet yield a defensive option. Whether motivated by self interest or a latent guilt complex, the West has offered several options to Armenia with onsite presence. The Artsakh disaster has Armenia flooded with European observers (increased and renewed), USAID personnel, a variety of diplomatic missions and other Western interests. Argentina has also offered onsite white helmet support to promote humanitarian needs and support. The military defense mechanisms to defend the homeland have been slow in developing. France has strongly hinted at providing military aid after a visit by a top official, but the content and timing is unclear. Deals have been announced with India, but again with uncertain timing. In an absurd irony, Russia maintains a military presence in Armenia, yet it has denied CSTO support several times in violation of the defense pact and has criticized Armenia's Western engagement. Russia clearly cannot be trusted to support Armenia, but it is still dangerous as the only regional power that can greenlight the Azeris. The YOU.N. Mission to Artsakh was a farce and insulting, as it was limited to an Azeri-controlled tour and foolishly declared no evidence of civilian targeting. This is comparable to allowing the criminal to guide investigators through the crime scene. It is another example of how the YOU.N., in the interest of remaining a global facade, has rendered itself ineffective. Perhaps the best option for Armenia is to invite as many foreign missions on the ground, particularly on the eastern front, as possible. The European and American presence could serve as a deterrent to Azeri military action. I do not think the Europeans and Americans will be as forgiving to the Azeris as the Russians were when their peacekeepers were murdered by the Azeris. Fortifying the defenses militarily goes without saying, but a physical presence of humanitarian, military attachs and consulate presence in Syunik might slow the Azeris down long enough to build a stronger defense. This is not a time to say no to any legitimate foreign presence that can further the short-term humanitarian and intermediate-term security issues in the homeland. On the contrary, we should be recruiting physical presence.",-1,{'article_hierarchy': 'main_article'},main_article,"The Armenian nation is not allowed the proper time to absorb the tragedy of Artsakh, says Hrant Dink.

The failure of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to visit the site speaks volumes about the arrogance of the political class in Bihar, Kishor told reporters when asked about the accident.
